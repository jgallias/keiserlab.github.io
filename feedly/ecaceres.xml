The C-terminus domain of non-structural 3 (NS3) protein of the &lt;i&gt;Flaviviridae&lt;/i&gt; viruses (e.g. HCV, dengue, West Nile, Zika) is a nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) -dependent superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA while translocating along the nucleic polymer. Due to these functions, NS3 is an important target for antiviral development yet the biophysics of this enzyme are poorly understood. Microsecond-long molecular dynamic simulations of the dengue NS3 helicase domain are reported from which allosteric effects of RNA and NTPase substrates are observed. The presence of a bound single-stranded RNA catalytically enhances the phosphate hydrolysis reaction by affecting the dynamics and positioning of waters within the hydrolysis active site. Coupled with results from the simulations, electronic structure calculations of the reaction are used to quantify this enhancement to be a 150-fold increase, in qualitative agreement with the experimental enhancement factor of 10–100. Additionally, protein-RNA interactions exhibit NTPase substrate-induced allostery, where the presence of a nucleotide (e.g. ATP or ADP) structurally perturbs residues in direct contact with the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. Residue-residue network analyses highlight pathways of short ranged interactions that connect the two active sites. These analyses identify motif V as a highly connected region of protein structure through which energy released from either active site is hypothesized to move, thereby inducing the observed allosteric effects. These results lay the foundation for the design of novel allosteric inhibitors of NS3.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tae9aMgOb9I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Russell B.

The accuracy of this process is largely dependent on the availability of machine-readable resources associating synonyms and abbreviations commonly found in biomedical literature with uniform identifiers. Results: In a task involving automated reading of ~215,000 articles using the REACH event extraction software we found that grounding was disproportionately inaccurate for multi-protein families (e.g., &amp;quot;AKT&amp;quot;) and complexes with multiple subunits (e.g. &amp;quot;NF-kappaB&amp;quot;). To address this problem we constructed FamPlex, a manually curated resource defining protein families and complexes as they are commonly encountered in biomedical text. In FamPlex the gene-level constituents of families and complexes are defined in a flexible format allowing for multi-level, hierarchical membership. To create FamPlex, text strings corresponding to entities were identified empirically from literature and linked manually to uniform identifiers; these identifiers were also mapped to equivalent entries in multiple related databases. FamPlex also includes curated prefix and suffix patterns that improve named entity recognition and event extraction. Evaluation of REACH extractions on a test corpus of ~54,000 articles showed that FamPlex significantly increased grounding accuracy for families and complexes (from 15% to 71%). The hierarchical organization of entities in FamPlex also made it possible to integrate otherwise unconnected mechanistic information across families, subfamilies, and individual proteins. Applications of FamPlex to the TRIPS/DRUM reading system and the Biocreative VI Bioentity Normalization Task dataset demonstrated the utility of FamPlex in other settings. Conclusion: FamPlex is an effective resource for improving named entity recognition, grounding, and relationship resolution in automated reading of biomedical text.

Results: In a task involving automated reading of ~215,000 articles using the REACH event extraction software we found that grounding was disproportionately inaccurate for multi-protein families (e.g., &amp;quot;AKT&amp;quot;) and complexes with multiple subunits (e.g. &amp;quot;NF-kappaB&amp;quot;). To address this problem we constructed FamPlex, a manually curated resource defining protein families and complexes as they are commonly encountered in biomedical text. In FamPlex the gene-level constituents of families and complexes are defined in a flexible format allowing for multi-level, hierarchical membership. To create FamPlex, text strings corresponding to entities were identified empirically from literature and linked manually to uniform identifiers; these identifiers were also mapped to equivalent entries in multiple related databases. FamPlex also includes curated prefix and suffix patterns that improve named entity recognition and event extraction. Evaluation of REACH extractions on a test corpus of ~54,000 articles showed that FamPlex significantly increased grounding accuracy for families and complexes (from 15% to 71%). The hierarchical organization of entities in FamPlex also made it possible to integrate otherwise unconnected mechanistic information across families, subfamilies, and individual proteins. Applications of FamPlex to the TRIPS/DRUM reading system and the Biocreative VI Bioentity Normalization Task dataset demonstrated the utility of FamPlex in other settings. Conclusion: FamPlex is an effective resource for improving named entity recognition, grounding, and relationship resolution in automated reading of biomedical text.

Epileptic seizures are known to follow specific changes in brain dynamics. While some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes, a clear understanding of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still lacking. Here, we provide crossvalidated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our analysis of long intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable (&amp;quot;degenerate&amp;quot;), and this phase is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to be particularly associated with the activity of the resected regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome. Our approach characterizes preseizure network dynamics as a cascade of 2 sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/DHVkBqQJLvk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Adrià Tauste Campo, Alessandro Principe, Miguel Ley, Rodrigo Rocamora, Gustavo Deco&lt;/p&gt;

Two plasma devices at atmospheric pressure (air dielectric barrier discharge and helium plasma jet) have been used to study the early germination of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; seeds during the first days. Then, plasma activated waters are used during the later stage of plant development and growth until 42 days. The effects on both testa and endospserm ruptures during the germination stage are significant in the case of air plasma due to its higher energy and efficiency of producing reactive oxygen species than the case of helium plasma. The latter has shown distinct effects only for testa rupture. Analysis of germination stimulations are based on specific stainings for reactive oxygen species production, peroxidase activity and also membrane permeability tests. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown a smoother seed surface for air plasma treated seeds that can explain the plasma induced-germination. During the growth stage, plants were watered using 4 kinds of water (tap and deionized waters activated or not by the low temperature plasma jet). With regards to other water kinds, the characterization of the tap water has shown a larger conductivity, acidity and concentration of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Only the tap water activated by the plasma jet has shown a significant effect on the plant growth. This effect could be correlated to reactive nitrogen species such as nitrite/nitrate species present in plasma activated tap water.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195512</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fa5a3ed9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maxime Bafoil, Achraf Jemmat, Yves Martinez, Nofel Merbahi, Olivier Eichwald, Christophe Dunand, Mohammed Yousfi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Social support has been identified as a significant factor in facilitating better health outcomes following injury. However, research has primarily focused on the role of social support from the perspective of the person experiencing an injury. Limited research has examined the experiences of the family members and friends of a person with injury. This study aims to explore the perceptions and experiences of social support and recovery following a transport-related musculoskeletal injury (MSI) in a population of injured persons and their family members and friends.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted using a phenomenological qualitative research design.

Furthermore, family members and friends engaged in the recovery process may benefit from support in this role.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196337</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Khic-Houy Prang</name></author><title>&quot;That&apos;s what you do for people you love&quot;: A qualitative study of social support and recovery from a musculoskeletal injury</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524690000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67be:91749e5b</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196337</link><published>1524690000000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23371-w</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;S-Nitrosoglutathione Reductase Underlies the Dysfunctional Relaxation to Nitric Oxide in Preterm Labor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S-Nitrosoglutathione Reductase Underlies the Dysfunctional Relaxation to Nitric Oxide in Preterm Labor, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23371-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23371-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;S-Nitrosoglutathione Reductase Underlies the Dysfunctional Relaxation to Nitric Oxide in Preterm Labor&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/m_wock-XCOw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;S-Nitrosoglutathione Reductase Underlies the Dysfunctional Relaxation to Nitric Oxide in Preterm Labor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S-Nitrosoglutathione Reductase Underlies the Dysfunctional Relaxation to Nitric Oxide in Preterm Labor, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23371-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23371-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;S-Nitrosoglutathione Reductase Underlies the Dysfunctional Relaxation to Nitric Oxide in Preterm Labor&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/m_wock-XCOw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23371-w/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23371_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>665</width></visual><crawled>1522833366950</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1addee43</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23371-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/m_wock-XCOw/s41598-018-23371-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Scott D.

Background &lt;p&gt;HIV prevalence varies from 1.7% to 14.8% between ethnic groups in Uganda. Understanding the factors responsible for this heterogeneity in HIV spread may guide prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the relationship between HIV prevalence by ethnic group and a range of risk factors as well as the prevalence of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), syphilis and symptomatic STIs in the 2004/2005 Uganda HIV/AIDS Sero-Behavioural Survey—a two stage, nationally representative, population based survey of 15–59-year-olds. Spearman’s correlation was used to assess the relationship between HIV prevalence and each variable.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There was a positive association between HIV prevalence and HSV-2, symptomatic STIs and high-risk sex (sex with a non-cohabiting, non-marital partner) for women. Non-significant positive associations were present between HIV and high-risk sex for men and lifetime number of partners for men and women.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Variation in sexual behavior may contribute to the variations in HIV, HSV-2 and other STI prevalence by ethnic group in Uganda.

The ABCG2 multidrug transporter provides resistance against various endo- and xenobiotics, and protects the stem cells against toxins and stress conditions. We have shown earlier that a GFP-tagged version of ABCG2 is fully functional and may be used to follow the expression, localization and function of this transporter in living cells. In the present work we have overexpressed GFP-ABCG2, driven by a constitutive (CAG) promoter, in HUES9 human embryonic stem cells. Stem cell clones were generated to express the wild-type and a substrate-mutant (R482G) GFP-ABCG2 variant, by using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. We found that the stable overexpression of these transgenes did not change the pluripotency and growth properties of the stem cells, nor their differentiation capacity to hepatocytes or cardiomyocytes. ABCG2 overexpression provided increased toxin resistance in the stem cells, and protected the derived cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin toxicity. These studies document the potential of a stable ABCG2 expression for engineering toxin-resistant human pluripotent stem cells and selected stem cell derived tissues.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194925</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ad7fb478</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zsuzsa Erdei, Anita Schamberger, György Török, Kornélia Szebényi, György Várady, Tamás I.

Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reflects cerebral perfusion and tissue oxygen consumption, which decline in some patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or stroke, especially during exercise. Its physiologic basis and clinical significance remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with oxygen transport physiology and known prognostic factors during both rest and exercise in patients with HFrEF or stroke. Thirty-four HFrEF patients, 26 stroke patients, and 17 healthy controls performed an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test using a bicycle ergometer. Integrated near-infrared spectroscopy and automatic gas analysis were used to measure cerebral tissue oxygenation and cardiac and ventilatory parameters. We found that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (rest; peak) were significantly lower in the HFrEF (66.3±13.3%; 63.4±13.8%,) than in the stroke (72.1±4.2%; 72.7±4.5%) and control (73.1±2.8%; 72±3.2%) groups. In the HFrEF group, SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at rest (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;) and peak SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;) were linearly correlated with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), peak oxygen consumption (V˙O2peak), and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; between -0.561 and 0.677, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Stepwise linear regression showed that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide at rest (P&lt;sub&gt;ET&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;), hemoglobin, and mean arterial pressure at rest (MAP&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) (adjusted R = 0.681, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; was mainly affected by peak carbon dioxide production (V˙CO2peak) (adjusted R = 0.653, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in patients with HFrEF. In conclusion, the study delineates the relationship of cerebral saturation and parameters associated with oxygen delivery. Moreover, SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; and SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt; are correlated with some well-recognized prognostic factors in HFrEF, suggesting its potential prognostic value.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196299</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fb85d3f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Jen Chen, Jong-Shyan Wang, Chih-Chin Hsu, Pyng-Jing Lin, Feng-Chun Tsai, Ming-Shien Wen, Chi-Tai Kuo, Shu-Chun Huang&lt;/p&gt;

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is not well understood at the molecular level. Exactly why some brain regions produce epileptic discharges and others do not is not known. Patients who fail to respond to antiseizure medication (refractory epilepsy) can benefit from surgical removal of brain regions to reduce seizure frequency. The tissue removed in these surgeries offers an invaluable resource to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of human epilepsy. Here, we report a proteomic study to determine whether there are common proteomic patterns in human brain regions that produce epileptic discharges. We analyzed human brain samples, as part of the Systems Biology of Epilepsy Project (SBEP). These brain pieces are &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized human brain samples withdrawn from the neocortex of six patients with refractory epilepsy. This study is unique in that for each of these six patients the comparison of protein expression was made within the same patient: a more epileptic region was compared to a less epileptic brain region. The amount of epileptic activity was defined for each patient as the frequency of their interictal spikes (electric activity between seizures that is a parameter strongly linked to epilepsy). Proteins were resolved from three subcellular fractions, using a 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), revealing 31 identified protein spots that changed significantly. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was found to be consistently down regulated in high spiking brain tissue and showed a strong negative correlation with spike frequency. We also developed a two-step analysis method to select for protein species that changed frequently among the patients and identified these proteins. A total of 397 protein spots of interest (SOI) were clustered by protein expression patterns across all samples. These clusters were used as markers and this analysis predicted proteomic changes due to both histological differences and molecular pathways, revealed by examination of gene ontology clusters. Our experimental design and proteomic data analysis predicts novel glial changes, increased angiogenesis, and changes in cytoskeleton and neuronal projections between high and low interictal spiking regions. Quantitative histological staining of these same tissues for both the vascular and glial changes confirmed these findings, which provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6cf59a96</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gal Keren-Aviram, Fabien Dachet, Shruti Bagla, Karina Balan, Jeffrey A.

Sponge-cyanobacteria associations have attracted research interest from an ecological, evolutionary and biotechnological perspective. Current knowledge is, in its majority, “hidden” in metagenomics research studying the entire microbial communities of sponges, while knowledge on these associations is totally missing for certain geographic areas. In this study, we (a) investigated the occurrence of cyanobacteria in 18 sponge species, several of which are studied for the first time for their cyanobionts, from a previously unexplored eastern Mediterranean ecoregion, the Aegean Sea, (b) isolated sponge-associated cyanobacteria, and characterized them based on a polyphasic (morphological-morphometric and molecular phylogenetic analysis) approach, and (c) conducted a meta-analysis on the global diversity of sponge species hosting cyanobacteria, as well as the diversity of cyanobacterial symbionts. Our research provided new records for nine sponge species, previously unknown for this association, while the isolated cyanobacteria were found to form novel clades within &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/i&gt;, Leptolyngbyaceae, Pseudanabaenaceae, and Schizotrichaceae, whose taxonomic status requires further investigation; this is the first report of a Schizotrichaceae cyanobacterium associated with sponges. The extensive evaluation of the literature along with the new data from the Aegean Sea raised the number of sponge species known for hosting cyanobacteria to 320 and showed that the cyanobacterial diversity reported from sponges is yet underestimated.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195001</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8308395c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Despoina Konstantinou, Vasilis Gerovasileiou, Eleni Voultsiadou, Spyros Gkelis&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;This study was designed to assess the mechanical properties of two calcium carbonate tempers, limestone and burnt shell. These tempers have been previously compared, in separate studies, to silicate-based grit or sand temper and, relative to the latter, are assumed to possess similar mechanical properties. However, their simultaneous use at the Morrison Village site begs the question: do these two calcium carbonate tempers indeed possess similar mechanical properties? In order to assess their performance characteristics, a side-by-side controlled experimental test was conducted to determine the degree of similarity in providing increased vessel strength and toughness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Standardized ceramic test samples were systematically prepared via a set, explicit protocol. An Instron Series IX universal testing machine configured with a four-point flexural test jig was used to perform a flexural strength test of the test samples. The Instron load and deflection data were used to calculate three values related to mechanical performance: &lt;i&gt;peak load&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;modulus of rupture&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;modulus of elasticity&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All four comparative tests clearly show substantial differences in &lt;i&gt;peak load&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;modulus of rupture&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;modulus of elasticity&lt;/i&gt;. These differences are statistically significant for each performance attribute in every iteration of the experiment and as indicated by Mann-Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; Tests.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results do not support the hypothesis that limestone and burnt shell offer the same performance characteristics. These results have implications for our understanding of prehistoric human selection of temper and the evolution of ceramic technology. Although both carbonate-based tempers are currently thought to offer the same benefits during the initial phase of pottery production, their contrasting post firing properties would have provided distinct benefits in different contexts. Future assessments of the Morrison Village ceramic assemblage should focus on residue analysis, or other functional indicators, to support or falsify this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194992</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>915489ec</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michelle Rae Bebber, Linda B.

&lt;i&gt;Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum&lt;/i&gt; is a thermophilic anaerobe that has been engineered to produce high amounts of ethanol, reaching ~90% theoretical yield at a titer of 70 g/L. Here we report the physiological changes that occur upon deleting the redox-sensing transcriptional regulator Rex in wild type &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;saccharolyticum&lt;/i&gt;: a single deletion of &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; resulted in a two-fold increase in ethanol yield (from 40% to 91% theoretical yield), but the resulting strains grew only about a third as fast as the wild type strain. Deletion of the &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; gene also had the effect of increasing expression of alcohol dehydrogenase genes, &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;adhA&lt;/i&gt;. After several serial transfers, the ethanol yield decreased from an average of 91% to 55%, and the growth rates had increased. We performed whole-genome resequencing to identify secondary mutations in the Δ&lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; strains adapted for faster growth. In several cases, secondary mutations had appeared in the &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; gene. Furthermore, in these strains the NADH-linked alcohol dehydrogenase activity was greatly reduced. Complementation studies were done to reintroduce &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; into the Δ&lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; strains: reintroducing &lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; decreased ethanol yield to below wild type levels in the Δ&lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; strain without &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; mutations, but did not change the ethanol yield in the Δ&lt;i&gt;rex&lt;/i&gt; strain where an &lt;i&gt;adhE&lt;/i&gt; mutation occurred.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195143</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>406e51cd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tianyong Zheng, Anthony A.

To elucidate the association between renal hyperfiltration (RHF) and incident proteinuria, the data from 11,559,520 Korean adults who had undergone health screenings ≥ 3 times between 2009 and 2014 and had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and negative dipstick test for proteinuria at baseline, were retrospectively analyzed. GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine, and RHF was defined as GFR &gt;95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile adjusted for sex, age, body size, and diabetes and/or hypertension medication. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of incident proteinuria in the RHF was 1.083 (95% CI, 1.069~1.097) compared to that of the non-RHF with Cox regression model. The association between RHF and incident proteinuria was not only in diabetic but also in non-diabetic subjects. This association was not observed in women (p for interaction &amp;lt;0.001). A reverse J-shaped association was found between the adjusted GFR slope and aHR of incident proteinuria. Both lower and higher GFR were associated with incident proteinuria in men.

Offspring survival is generally more variable than adult survival and may limit population growth. Although white-tailed deer neonate survival has been intensively investigated, recent work has emphasized how specific cover types influence neonate survival at local scales (single study area). These localized investigations have often led to inconsistences within the literature. Developing specific hypotheses describing the relationships among environmental, habitat, and landscape factors influencing white-tailed deer neonate survival at regional scales may allow for detection of generalized patterns. Therefore, we developed 11 hypotheses representing the various effects of environmental (e.g., winter and spring weather), habitat (e.g., hiding and escape cover types), and landscape factors (e.g., landscape configuration regardless of specific cover type available) on white-tailed deer neonate survival up to one-month and from one- to three-months of age. At one-month, surviving fawns experienced a warmer lowest recorded June temperature and more June precipitation than those that perished. At three-months, patch connectance (percent of patches of the corresponding patch type that are connected within a predefined distance) positively influenced survival. Our results are consistent with white-tailed deer neonate ecology: increased spring temperature and precipitation are likely associated with a flush of nutritional resources available to the mother, promoting increased lactation efficiency and neonate growth early in life. In contrast, reduced spring temperature with increased precipitation place neonates at risk to hypothermia. Increased patch connectance likely reflects increased escape cover available within a neonate’s home range after they are able to flee from predators. If suitable escape cover is available on the landscape, then managers could focus efforts towards manipulating landscape configuration (patch connectance) to promote increased neonate survival while monitoring spring weather to assess potential influences on current year survival.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195247</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2ecedc0e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric S.

Background and objectives &lt;p&gt;Sick neonates in malaria endemic areas are frequently transfused with donor blood unscreened for malaria parasite. Consequently, they are at risk of transfusional malaria which can lead to increased neonatal mortality. The study aimed to determine the burden of transfusional malaria in neonates to help in policy formulation on prevention of transfusional malaria.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;One hundred and sixty four neonates admitted into the neonatal unit of a tertiary hospital over a 10 month period who were scheduled for blood transfusion were screened for malaria parasites pre-transfusion, at three and 14 days post transfusion using Giemsa stained thick and thin films. Donor blood was screened for malaria parasites at the point of transfusion. Neonates who developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion were followed up for signs of malaria.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All recruited neonates tested negative to malaria parasite pre- transfusion. One hundred and twenty (73.2%) were term neonates with 94(57.3%) aged 1-7days. Four (2.4%) neonates developed malaria parasitaemia three days post transfusion and all four developed fever that resolved on treatment for malaria. Three (1.8%) of 164 donor blood samples had malaria parasitaemia and all three (100%) neonates who were transfused with the infected donor blood developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion.

Background and objectives &lt;p&gt;Sick neonates in malaria endemic areas are frequently transfused with donor blood unscreened for malaria parasite. Consequently, they are at risk of transfusional malaria which can lead to increased neonatal mortality. The study aimed to determine the burden of transfusional malaria in neonates to help in policy formulation on prevention of transfusional malaria.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;One hundred and sixty four neonates admitted into the neonatal unit of a tertiary hospital over a 10 month period who were scheduled for blood transfusion were screened for malaria parasites pre-transfusion, at three and 14 days post transfusion using Giemsa stained thick and thin films. Donor blood was screened for malaria parasites at the point of transfusion. Neonates who developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion were followed up for signs of malaria.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All recruited neonates tested negative to malaria parasite pre- transfusion. One hundred and twenty (73.2%) were term neonates with 94(57.3%) aged 1-7days. Four (2.4%) neonates developed malaria parasitaemia three days post transfusion and all four developed fever that resolved on treatment for malaria. Three (1.8%) of 164 donor blood samples had malaria parasitaemia and all three (100%) neonates who were transfused with the infected donor blood developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion. However, one neonate who developed malaria parasitaemia post transfusion was transfused with non-infected donor blood.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of transfusional malaria in this study is low (2.4%).

We investigated how visual and kinaesthetic/efferent information is integrated for speed perception in running. Twelve moderately trained to trained subjects ran on a treadmill at three different speeds (8, 10, 12 km/h) in front of a moving virtual scene. They were asked to match the visual speed of the scene to their running speed–i.e., treadmill’s speed. For each trial, participants indicated whether the scene was moving slower or faster than they were running. Visual speed was adjusted according to their response using a staircase until the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) was reached, i.e., until visual and running speed were perceived as equivalent. For all three running speeds, participants systematically underestimated the visual speed relative to their actual running speed. Indeed, the speed of the visual scene had to exceed the actual running speed in order to be perceived as equivalent to the treadmill speed. The underestimation of visual speed was speed-dependent, and percentage of underestimation relative to running speed ranged from 15% at 8km/h to 31% at 12km/h. We suggest that this fact should be taken into consideration to improve the design of attractive treadmill-mediated virtual environments enhancing engagement into physical activity for healthier lifestyles and disease prevention and care.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7fb183c6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Caramenti, Claudio L.

Human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3) proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the conversion of deoxycytidine (dC) to deoxyuridine (dU) in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis—for example, A3G deaminates the third dC in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy using the protection of telomeres protein 1 (Pot1) which has nanomolar affinity for ssDNA, with which we captured an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We crystallized a non-preferred adenine in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G. The structure reveals a unique conformation of the catalytic site loops that sheds light onto how the enzyme scans substrate in the -1 pocket. Furthermore, our biochemistry and virology studies provide evidence that the nucleotide-binding pockets on A3G influence each other in selecting the preferred DNA substrate. Together, the results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195048</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d1d1d7b7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samantha J.

Associations of metabolism with such outcomes are expected to span functional modules, which are defined as sets of correlating metabolites that are coordinately regulated. Moreover, these associations occur at different scales, from entire pathways to only a few metabolites, which is an aspect that has not been addressed by previous methods. Here we present MoDentify, a freely available R package to identify regulated modules in metabolomics networks at different layers of resolution. Importantly, MoDentify shows higher statistical power than classical association analysis. Moreover, the package offers direct visualization of results as interactive networks in Cytoscape. We present an application example using a complex, multifluid metabolomics dataset.

Associations of metabolism with such outcomes are expected to span functional modules, which are defined as sets of correlating metabolites that are coordinately regulated. Moreover, these associations occur at different scales, from entire pathways to only a few metabolites, which is an aspect that has not been addressed by previous methods. Here we present MoDentify, a freely available R package to identify regulated modules in metabolomics networks at different layers of resolution. Importantly, MoDentify shows higher statistical power than classical association analysis. Moreover, the package offers direct visualization of results as interactive networks in Cytoscape. We present an application example using a complex, multifluid metabolomics dataset. Owing to its generic character, the method is widely applicable to any dataset with a phenotype variable, a data matrix, and optional pathway annotations.

To grow straight and upright, plants need to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation (tilting) experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observations of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7ec64172</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Renaud Bastien, Olivia Guayasamin, Stéphane Douady, Bruno Moulia&lt;/p&gt;

Polyploidization has played an important role in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly at the base of Teleostei–an enormously successful ray-finned fish group with additional genome doublings on lower taxonomic levels. The investigation of post-polyploid genome dynamics might provide important clues about the evolution and ecology of respective species and can help to decipher the role of polyploidy &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on speciation. Few studies have attempted to investigate the dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences in the post-polyploid genome using molecular cytogenetic tools in fishes, though recent efforts demonstrated their usefulness. The demonstrably monophyletic freshwater loach family Botiidae, branching to evolutionary diploid and tetraploid lineages separated &gt;25 Mya, offers a suited model group for comparing the long-term repetitive DNA evolution. For this, we integrated phylogenetic analyses with cytogenetical survey involving Giemsa- and Chromomycin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/DAPI stainings and fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization with 5S/45S rDNA, U2 snDNA and telomeric probes in representative sample of 12 botiid species.
The karyotypes of all diploids were composed of 2n = 50 chromosomes, while majority of tetraploids had 2n = 4x = 100, with only subtle interspecific karyotype differences. The exceptional karyotype of &lt;i&gt;Botia dario&lt;/i&gt; (2n = 4x = 96) suggested centric fusions behind the 2n reduction. Variable patterns of FISH signals revealed cases of intraspecific polymorphisms, rDNA amplification, variable degree of correspondence with CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and almost no phylogenetic signal. In tetraploids, either additivity or loci gain/loss was recorded. Despite absence of classical interstitial telomeric sites, large blocks of interspersed rDNA/telomeric regions were found in diploids only.
We uncovered different molecular drives of studied repetitive DNA classes within botiid genomes as well as the advanced stage of the re-diploidization process in tetraploids. Our results may contribute to link genomic approach with molecular cytogenetic analyses in addressing the origin and mechanism of this polyploidization event.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195054</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b6e8f653</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandr Sember, Jörg Bohlen, Vendula Šlechtová, Marie Altmanová, Šárka Pelikánová, Petr Ráb&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Agreed international development standards underpin high quality &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There is however, no international consensus on how high quality CPGs should ‘look’; or on whether high quality CPGs from one country can be viably implemented elsewhere. Writing d&lt;i&gt;e novo&lt;/i&gt; CPGs is generally resource-intensive and expensive, making this challenging in resource-poor environments. This paper proposes an alternative, efficient method of producing high quality CPGs in such circumstances, using existing CPGs layered by local knowledge, contexts and products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We undertook a mixed methods case study in South African (SA) primary healthcare (PHC), building on findings from four independent studies. These comprised an overview of international CPG activities; a rapid literature review on international CPG development practices; critical appraisal of 16 purposively-sampled SA PHC CPGs; and additional interrogation of these CPGs regarding how, why and for whom, they had been produced, and how they ‘looked’.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Despite a common aim to improve SA PHC healthcare practices, the included CPGs had different, unclear and inconsistent production processes, terminology and evidence presentation styles. None aligned with international quality standards. However many included innovative succinct guidance for end-users (which we classified as evidence-based summary recommendations, patient management tools or protocols). We developed a three-tiered model, a checklist and a glossary of common terms, for more efficient future production of better quality, contextually-relevant, locally-implementable SA PHC CPGs. Tier 1 involves transparent synthesis of existing high quality CPG recommendations; Tier 2 reflects local expertise to layer Tier 1 evidence with local contexts; and Tier 3 comprises tailored locally-relevant end-user guidance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our model could be relevant for any resource-poor environment. It should reduce effort and costs in finding and synthesising available research evidence, whilst efficiently focusing scant resources on contextually-relevant evidence-based guidance, and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195025</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4d5d5356</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shingai Machingaidze, Karen Grimmer, Quinette Louw, Tamara Kredo, Taryn Young, Jimmy Volmink&lt;/p&gt;

Endothelial dysfunction is one of the main pathological changes in Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway is associated with endothelial dysfunction. However, the interaction between ROCK and nuclear factor of activated T cells isoform c3 (NFATc3) in the development of this pathological response under chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is unclear. To simulate the OSA model, we established a moderate CIH rat model by administering the fraction of inspired O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from 21% to 9%, 20 times/h, 8 h/day for 3 weeks. Fasudil (ROCK inhibitor, 8 mg/kg/d, i.p.) was administrated in the rats exposed to CIH for 3 weeks. Our results demonstrated that CIH caused significantly endothelial dysfunction, accompanying with increased ET-1 level, decreased eNOS expression and NO production, which reduced ACh-induced vascular relaxation responses. Moreover, RhoA/ROCK-2/NFATc3 expressions were up-regulated. Fasudil significantly improved CIH induced endothelial dysfunction. Data suggested that the ROCK activation is necessary for endothelial dysfunction during CIH.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195604</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>37a8a2b4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jie-Ru Li, Ya-Shuo Zhao, Yue Chang, Sheng-Chang Yang, Ya-Jing Guo, En-Sheng Ji&lt;/p&gt;

Data suggested that the ROCK activation is necessary for endothelial dysfunction during CIH.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195604</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jie-Ru Li</name></author><title>Fasudil improves endothelial dysfunction in rats exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia through RhoA/ROCK/NFATc3 pathway</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523480400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd95:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195604</link><published>1523480400000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1542?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary innovations are often achieved by repurposing existing genes to perform new functions; however, the mechanisms enabling the transition from old to new remain controversial.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition driven by loss of homeostasis between the mucosal immune system, the commensal gut microbiota, and the intestinal epithelium. Our goal is to understand how these components of the intestinal ecosystem cooperate to control homeostasis. By combining quantitative measures of epithelial hyperplasia and immune infiltration with multivariate analysis of inter- and intracellular signaling, we identified epithelial mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as a potential driver of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. A kinetic analysis of mTOR inhibition revealed that the pathway regulates epithelial differentiation, which in turn controls the cytokine milieu of the colon. Consistent with our in vivo analysis, we found that cytokine expression of organoids grown ex vivo, in the absence of bacteria and immune cells, was dependent on differentiation state. Our study suggests that proper differentiation of epithelial cells is an important feature of colonic homeostasis because of its effect on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZpVf1yiGbfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jesse Lyons, Phaedra C.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Heightened sexual risk in adolescence and young adulthood may be partially explained by deficits in executive functioning, the set of cognitive processes used to make reasoned decisions. However, the association between executive function and sexual risk is understudied among adolescent girls and young women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort of 853 young women age 18–25 in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, we evaluated executive function with three non-verbal cognitive tests: I. a rule-finding test, II. a trail-making test, and III. a figure drawing test. Using log-binomial regression models, we estimated the association between lower executive function test scores and indicators of sexual risk (unprotected sex acts, concurrent partnerships, transactional sex, and recent HSV-2 infection).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In general, young women with lower executive function scores reported higher frequencies of sexual risk outcomes, though associations tended to be small with wide confidence intervals. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test I was associated with more unprotected sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.4 (1.0, 1.8)]. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test II was associated with more concurrent relationships and transactional sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.6 (1.1, 2.5) and 1.7 (1.3, 2.4), respectively], and testing in the lowest four quintiles of Test III was associated with more concurrent relationships [aPR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.0, 2.7)].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate an association between low executive function and sexual risk in South African young women.

Hydraulic fracturing can improve the permeability of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs effectively, which is of great significance to the commercial production of CBM. However, the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing is affected by multiple factors. The mechanism of fracture initiation, morphology and propagation in CBM reservoirs is not clear and need to be further explored. Hydraulic fracturing experiment is an accurate tool to explore these mechanisms. The quantity of experimental coal rock is large and processing method is complex, so specimen made of similar materials was applied to replace coal rock. The true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experimental apparatus, 3D scanning device for coal rock section were applied to carry out hydraulic fracturing experiment. The results show that the initiation pressure is inversely proportional to the horizontal stress difference (Δσ) and positively related to fracturing fluid injection rate. When vertical stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) is constant, the initiation pressure and fracture width decrease with the increasing of Δσ. Natural fractures can be connected by main fracture when propagates perpendicular to the direction of minimum horizontal stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;), then secondary fractures and fracture network form in CBM reservoirs. When two stresses of crustal stress are close and far different from the third one, the fracture morphology and propagation become complex. Influenced by perforations and filtration of fracturing fluid in specimen, fracturing fluid flows to downward easily after comparing horizontal well fracturing with vertical well fracturing. Fracture width increases with the decreasing of elastic modulus, the intensity of fracture is positively related with the elastic modulus of coal rock. The research results can provide theoretical basis and technical support for the efficient development of CBM.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195363</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>90602380</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fan Zhang, Geng Ma, Xiao Liu, Yunqi Tao, Dan Feng, Rui Li&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Frequent changes in the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) occurring worldwide demand regular surveillance to study their composition and distribution in healthcare facilities. We investigated the genotypic characteristics of MRSA obtained in Kuwait hospitals to better understand their clonal distribution.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,327 MRSA isolates obtained from clinical samples in 13 Kuwait hospitals from 1 January to 31 December 2016 were investigated using antibiogram, SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; typing, spa typing and DNA microarray.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The isolates belonged to six SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; types with the majority belonging to type IV (658; 49.5%) and type V (355; 26.7%). Two hundred and sixty-one spa types were identified with spa types t688, t304, t860, t127, t044, t311, t002, t223, t267, t019, t3841, t005, t084, t852, and t657 constituting 51.0% (n = 677) of the isolates. Among the 1,327 MRSA isolates, 102 (7.68%) isolates were identified as novel variants of internationally recognized MRSA clones. These 102 isolates were investigated further and belonged to 14 clonal complexes (CCs) with CC361 (32; 32.3%), CC30 (15; 14.7%), CC22 (13; 12.7%) and CC1 (11, 10.7%) as the dominant CCs. Eighty-one (79.4%) of the novel isolates harbored SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; IV or V+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt; composite genetic elements. Four isolates (3.9%) harbored unusual combinations of &lt;i&gt;ccr&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; complexes comprising of CC6-MRSA [IV+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrC&lt;/i&gt;], CC97-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB2&lt;/i&gt;], CC121-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrB4&lt;/i&gt;] and CC1-MRSA-pseudoSCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; [class B mec+&lt;i&gt;fusc&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB1&lt;/i&gt;]. Forty-six (45.1%) of these isolates were positive for PVL and 89 (87.2%) were resistant to fusidic acid mediated by &lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The study showed the emergence of novel variants of previously recognized MRSA genotypes with unusual genetic characteristics including high prevalence of PVL and fusidic acid resistance in Kuwait hospitals. This has added to the dynamic lists of known variations in MRSA genomes which can impose serious challenges for infection control and treatment of MRSA infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195933</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>efac3e78</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samar S.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the predictive factors for lateral pelvic lymph node (LPLN) metastasis in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and LPLNs larger than 5 mm underwent LPLN dissection (LPLD) after preoperative CRT. The MRI findings, including the apparent diffusion coefficient value and LPLN size reduction rate before/after CRT; clinical factors; and pathologic results were evaluated to identify the predictive factors associated with LPLN metastasis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;LPLN metastasis was confirmed in 23 patients (40.4%). Metastasis was significantly higher in LPLNs with multiplicity, short-axis diameter ≥8 mm before CRT, short-axis diameter &gt;5 mm after CRT, size reduction rate ≤33.3%, heterogeneous signal intensity, and irregular margin (P&amp;lt;0.05) on MR. Multivariable analysis showed that pre-CRT short-axis diameter of LPLNs ≥8 mm, size reduction rate ≤33.3%, and heterogeneous signal intensity were independently associated with LPLN metastasis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The size and signal intensity of LPLN before and after CRT are useful MRI findings to predict LPLN metastasis and are helpful to determine the indications for LPLD.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195815</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>23de69c6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Min Ju Kim, Bo Yun Hur, Eun Sun Lee, Boram Park, Jungnam Joo, Min Jung Kim, Sung Chan Park, Ji Yeon Baek, Hee Jin Chang, Dae Yong Kim, Jae Hwan Oh&lt;/p&gt;

Multivariable analysis showed that pre-CRT short-axis diameter of LPLNs ≥8 mm, size reduction rate ≤33.3%, and heterogeneous signal intensity were independently associated with LPLN metastasis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The size and signal intensity of LPLN before and after CRT are useful MRI findings to predict LPLN metastasis and are helpful to determine the indications for LPLD.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195815</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Min Ju Kim</name></author><title>Prediction of lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer with preoperative chemoradiotherapy: Focus on MR imaging findings</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66ce:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195815</link><published>1523566800000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/eaat9270?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/eaat9270.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524160533249</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6ce3ba6b</fingerprint><description>Erratum for the Report &amp;quot;A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni&amp;quot; by Y.

We report a computational model for the assembly of HIV-1 Gag into immature viral particles at the plasma membrane. To reproduce experimental structural and kinetic properties of assembly, a process occurring on the order of minutes, a coarse-grained representation consisting of a single particle per Gag molecule is developed. The model uses information relating the functional interfaces implicated in Gag assembly, results from cryo electron-tomography, and biophysical measurements from fluorescence microscopy, such as the dynamics of Gag assembly at single virions. These experimental constraints eliminated many classes of potential interactions, and narrowed the model to a single interaction scheme with two non-equivalent interfaces acting to form Gags into a hexamer, and a third interface acting to link hexamers together. This model was able to form into a hexameric structure with correct lattice spacing and reproduced biologically relevant growth rates. We explored the effect of genomic RNA seeding punctum growth, finding that RNA may be a factor in locally concentrating Gags to initiate assembly. The simulation results infer that completion of assembly cannot be governed simply by Gag binding kinetics. However the addition of membrane curvature suggests that budding of the virion from the plasma membrane could factor into slowing incorporation of Gag at an assembly site resulting in virions of the same size and number of Gag molecules independent of Gag concentration or the time taken to complete assembly. To corroborate the results of our simulation model, we developed an analytic model for Gag assembly finding good agreement with the simulation results.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196133</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>589e7c9f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael D.

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to summarize and discuss the similarities and differences in inflammatory biomarkers in postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic retrieval of literature up to June 2017 in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and the Wanfang database was conducted. Extracted data were analyzed with STATA (version 14). The standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each indicator were calculated using a random effect model. We also performed tests of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, assessments of bias, and meta-regression in this meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 54 observational studies were included. By meta-analysis we found significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (9 studies, SMD 0.883, 95% CI 0.130 to 1.637, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 10 studies, SMD -0.133, 95% CI -0.512 to 0.246, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.429 in POCD) and interleukin (IL)-6 (7 studies, SMD 0.386, 95% CI 0.054 to 0.717, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 16 studies, SMD 0.089, 95% CI -0.133 to 0.311, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.433 in POCD) concentrations in both POD and POCD patients. We also found that the SMDs of CRP and IL-6 from POCD patients were positively correlated with surgery type in the meta-regression (CRP: Coefficient = 1.555365, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 10 studies; IL-6: Coefficient = -0.6455521, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.086, 16 studies).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Available evidence from medium-to-high quality observational studies suggests that POD and POCD are indeed correlated with the concentration of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50). LF/HF did not differ between groups. Levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were associated with several HRV parameters, as well as Time from diagnosis of T2DM&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;T2DM was associated with an overall decrease in the HRV of T2DM patients. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity were decreased, which can be explained by the deleterious effects of altered glucose metabolism on HRV, leading to cardiac autonomic neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195166</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4a033e47</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Benichou, Bruno Pereira, Martial Mermillod, Igor Tauveron, Daniela Pfabigan, Salwan Maqdasy, Frédéric Dutheil&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;MRI is the optimal method for sensitive detection of tumour tissue and pre-operative staging in oral cancer. When jawbone resections are necessary, the current standard of care for oral tumour surgery in our hospital is 3D virtual planning from CT data. 3D printed jawbone cutting guides are designed from the CT data. The tumour margins are difficult to visualise on CT, whereas they are clearly visible on MRI scans. The aim of this study was to change the conventional CT-based workflow by developing a method for 3D MRI-based lower jaw models. The MRI-based visualisation of the tumour aids in planning bone resection margins.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and findings &lt;p&gt;A workflow for MRI-based 3D surgical planning with bone cutting guides was developed using a four-step approach. Key MRI parameters were defined (phase 1), followed by an application of selected Black Bone MRI sequences on healthy volunteers (phase 2). Three Black Bone MRI sequences were chosen for phase 3: standard, fat saturated, and an out of phase sequence. These protocols were validated by applying them on patients (n = 10) and comparison to corresponding CT data. The mean deviation values between the MRI- and the CT-based models were 0.63, 0.59 and 0.80 mm for the three evaluated Black Bone MRI sequences. Phase 4 entailed examination of the clinical value during surgery, using excellently fitting printed bone cutting guides designed from MRI-based lower jaw models, in two patients with oral cancer. The mean deviation of the resection planes was 2.3 mm, 3.8 mm for the fibula segments, and the mean axis deviation was the fibula segments of 1.9°.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study offers a method for 3D virtual resection planning and surgery using cutting guides based solely on MRI imaging. Therefore, no additional CT data are required for 3D virtual planning in oral cancer surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196059</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d8f94fdc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Astrid M.

Although several methods have been recently developed, they utilize different characteristics of data and yield varying results in terms of both the number of clusters and actual cluster assignments. Results: Here, we present SAFE-clustering, Single-cell Aggregated (From Ensemble) clustering, a flexible, accurate and robust method for clustering scRNA-Seq data. SAFE-clustering takes as input, results from multiple clustering methods, to build one consensus solution. SAFE-clustering currently embeds four state-of-the-art methods, SC3, CIDR, Seurat and t-SNE + k-means; and ensembles solutions from these four methods using three hypergraph-based partitioning algorithms. Extensive assessment across 12 datasets with the number of clusters ranging from 3 to 14, and the number of single cells ranging from 49 to 32,695 showcases the advantages of SAFE-clustering in terms of both cluster number (18.9 - 50.0% reduction in absolute deviation to the truth) and cluster assignment (on average 28.9% improvement, and up to 34.5% over the best of the four methods, measured by adjusted rand index). Moreover, SAFE-clustering is computationally efficient to accommodate large datasets, taking &amp;lt;10 minutes to process 28,733 cells.

Extensive assessment across 12 datasets with the number of clusters ranging from 3 to 14, and the number of single cells ranging from 49 to 32,695 showcases the advantages of SAFE-clustering in terms of both cluster number (18.9 - 50.0% reduction in absolute deviation to the truth) and cluster assignment (on average 28.9% improvement, and up to 34.5% over the best of the four methods, measured by adjusted rand index). Moreover, SAFE-clustering is computationally efficient to accommodate large datasets, taking &amp;lt;10 minutes to process 28,733 cells. Availability and implementation: SAFE-clustering, including source codes and tutorial, is free available on the web at http://yunliweb.its.unc.edu/safe/.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215723v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yang, Y.</name></author><title>SAFE-clustering: Single-cell Aggregated (From Ensemble) Clustering for Single-cell RNA-seq Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626de89465:6b272f1:7d6c1c1c</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215723v2?rss=1</link><published>1522220400000</published></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25151?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522119850699</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7b25a8cd</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25151?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>False</unread><published>1522119850699</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626569bacb:6ce10:76251cdd</id><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25151?af=R</link><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4535</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A checkup for the flu vaccine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A checkup for the flu vaccine, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4535&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm.4535&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Influenza causes almost 650,000 deaths worldwide each year, yet a long-lasting, protective vaccine remains elusive.

In the United States (US), the sugarcane aphid (SCA) &lt;i&gt;Melanaphis sacchari&lt;/i&gt; (Zehnter) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was introduced in the 1970s, however at that time it was only considered a pest of sugarcane. In 2013, a massive outbreak of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sacchari&lt;/i&gt; occured on sorghum, resulting in significant economic damage to sorghum grown in North America including the US, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The aim of the present study was to determine if the SCA pest emergence in American sorghum resulted from the introduction of new genotypes. To this end we used microsatellite markers and COI sequencing to compare the genetic diversity of SCA populations collected in the Americas after the 2013 SCA outbreak on sorghum (during 2013–2017) to older samples collected before the pest outbreak (during 2007–2009). Our results show that the SCA outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean observed since 2013 belong to populations exhibiting low genetic diversity and consisting of a dominant clonal lineage, MLL-F, which colonizes &lt;i&gt;Sorghum&lt;/i&gt; spp. and sugarcane. The comparison of MLL-F specimens collected post-2013 with specimens collected in Louisiana in 2007 revealed that both populations are genetically distinct, according to COI sequencing and microsatellite data analyses. Our result suggest that MLL-F is a new invasive genotype introduced into the Americas that has spread rapidly across sorghum growing regions in the US, Mexico, Honduras and the Caribbean. The origin of this introduction is either Africa or Asia, with Asia being the most probable source.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196124</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d320a996</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Nibouche, Laurent Costet, Jocelyn R.

Academic misconduct/dishonesty has become widespread behavior among many university students across the globe, and medical education is not an exception. Until recently, few efforts have been made to study the dishonest behavior in Middle-Eastern universities. This study examined the prevalence and predisposing factors of cheating among medical students in Saudi Arabia and suggests suitable preventive measures. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at a government medical college during the 2014–2015 academic year. The response rate was 58.5% (421/720). The overall cheating behavior practiced by the participants was 29%, predominantly by male students. High GPA scoring students were the least likely to cheat. The participants living with their families were more likely to cheat compared to those who were living apart from their families. The reasons participants gave to justify their cheating behavior included getting better grades, passing the course, and lacking preparation while still recognizing that cheating is a ‘mistake.’ Overall, significant academic misconduct concerning cheating was found among the Saudi medical students; this misconduct is alarming in a reputable government institution. The implementation of strict punishments, requiring ethical courses and creating ethical awareness by exploiting the potential of Islamic religious belief might help to control this problem.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194963</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>394e370c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani, Shafiul Haque, Yousef Abdullah Almusalam, Saleh Lafi Alanezi, Yazeed Abdulaziz Alsulaiman, Mohammad Irshad, Shaffi Ahmed Shaik, Nehal Khamis&lt;/p&gt;

Thyroid hormone (TH) orchestrates amphibian metamorphosis. Thus, this developmental phase is often used to study TH-dependent responses in specific tissues. However, TH signaling appears early in development raising the question of the control of TH availability in specific cell types prior to metamorphosis. TH availability is under strict temporal and tissue-specific control by deiodinases. We examined the expression of the TH-inactivating enzyme, deiodinase type 3 (D3), during early retinal development. To this end we created a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; transgenic line expressing GFP from the Xenopus &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter region (p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;) and followed p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;–GFP expression in pre-metamorphic tadpoles. To validate retinal GFP expression in the transgenic line as a function of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity, we used &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to compare endogenous &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression to reporter-driven GFP activity. Retinal expression of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; increased during pre-metamorphosis through stages NF41, 45 and 48. Both sets of results show &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; to have cell-specific, dynamic expression in the pre-metamorphic retina. At stage NF48, &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression co-localised with markers for photoreceptors, rods, Opsin-S cones and bipolar neurons. In contrast, in post-metamorphic juveniles &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression was reduced and spatially confined to certain photoreceptors and amacrine cells. We compared &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression at stages NF41 and NF48 with TH-dependent transcriptional responses using another transgenic reporter line: &lt;i&gt;THbZIP&lt;/i&gt;-GFP and by analyzing the expression of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-regulated genes in distinct TH availability contexts. At stage NF48, the majority of retinal cells expressing &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; were negative for T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signaling. Notably, most ganglion cells were virtually both &lt;i&gt;dio3-&lt;/i&gt;free and T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-responsive. The results show that &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; can reduce TH availability at the cellular scale. Further, a reduction in &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression can trigger fine-tuned T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; action in cell-type specific maturation at the right time, as exemplified here in photoreceptor survival in the pre-metamorphic retina.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>dff9ba9d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karine Le Blay, Laëtitia Préau, Ghislaine Morvan-Dubois, Barbara Demeneix&lt;/p&gt;

Further, a reduction in &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression can trigger fine-tuned T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; action in cell-type specific maturation at the right time, as exemplified here in photoreceptor survival in the pre-metamorphic retina.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Karine Le Blay</name></author><title>Expression of the inactivating deiodinase, Deiodinase 3, in the pre-metamorphic tadpole retina</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523480400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd8a:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195374</link><published>1523480400000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/161?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/161.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b8f66352</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/161?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Pauly, D.</name></author><title>The future of artisanal fishing</title><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Oceanography</item></keywords><engagement>11</engagement><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fecea1:34f43e70</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/161?rss=1</link><published>1523554635000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00118</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00118/20180403/images/medium/bi-2018-00118u_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00118&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings.

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) respond to numerous hormonal and neural signals, resulting in changes in food intake. Here, we demonstrate that ARC POMC neurons express capsaicin-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1)-like receptors. To show expression of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons, we use single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, TRPV1 knock-out (KO), and TRPV1-Cre knock-in mice. A small elevation of temperature in the physiological range is enough to depolarize ARC POMC neurons. This depolarization is blocked by the TRPV1 receptor antagonist and by &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene knockdown. Capsaicin-induced activation reduces food intake that is abolished by a melanocortin receptor antagonist. To selectively stimulate TRPV1-like receptor-expressing ARC POMC neurons in the ARC, we generate an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) carrying a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) expression cassette under the control of the two neuronal POMC enhancers (nPEs). Optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons decreases food intake. Hypothalamic temperature is rapidly elevated and reaches to approximately 39 °C during treadmill running. This elevation is associated with a reduction in food intake. Knockdown of the &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene exclusively in ARC POMC neurons blocks the feeding inhibition produced by increased hypothalamic temperature. Taken together, our findings identify a melanocortinergic circuit that links acute elevations in hypothalamic temperature with acute reductions in food intake.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LGEs5NFlL1s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Hoon Jeong, Dong Kun Lee, Shun-Mei Liu, Streamson C.

Taken together, our findings identify a melanocortinergic circuit that links acute elevations in hypothalamic temperature with acute reductions in food intake.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LGEs5NFlL1s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>903106e8</fingerprint><recrawled>1524594787541</recrawled><crawled>1524591809657</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><title>Activation of temperature-sensitive TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons reduces food intake</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004399</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/LGEs5NFlL1s/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jae Hoon Jeong</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>0.46</engagementRate><engagement>6</engagement><updated>1524603600000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f8c0d479:29c068:ae8b474d</id><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004399</link><published>1524603600000</published></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25219?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522925554799</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3a453cf7</fingerprint><description>Time‐dependent pair distribution function characterizes the diffusion of pairs of molecules in liquids.

The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is an evolutionary conserved cholesterol binding protein localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Expression of TSPO is upregulated in activated microglia in various neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic disorders. Therefore, TSPO radioligands are used as biomarkers in positron emission tomography (PET) studies. In particular, a common A147T polymorphism in the TSPO gene affects binding of several high affinity TSPO radioligands. Given the relevance of TSPO as a diagnostic biomarker in disease processes, we systematically searched for mutations in the human TSPO gene by a wide array of evolution and structure based bioinformatics tools and identified potentially deleterious missense mutations. The two most frequently observed missense mutations A147T and R162H were further analysed in structural models of human wildtype and mutant TSPO proteins. The effects of missense mutations were studied on the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations. To analyse putative effects of A147T and R162H variants on protein stability we established primary dermal fibroblast cultures from wt and homozygous A147T and R162H donors. Stability of endogenous TSPO protein, which is abundantly expressed in fibroblasts, was studied using cycloheximide protein degradation assay. Our data show that the A147T mutation significantly alters the flexibility and stability of the mutant protein. Furthermore both A147T and R162H mutations decreased the half-life of the mutant proteins by about 25 percent, which could in part explain its effect on reduced pregnenolone production and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study is the first comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of genetic variants in the TSPO gene, thereby extending the knowledge about the clinical relevance of TSPO nsSNPs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195627</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6738bd2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vladimir M.

The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were able to accumulate in gene-rich open chromatin regions due to their reduced capacity to interrupt gene regulatory architecture. GO term enrichment showed that mouse loss hotspots were strongly enriched for terms related to developmental processes. However, these genes were also located in regions with a high density of conserved elements, suggesting that despite high levels of DNA loss, gene regulatory architecture remained conserved. This is consistent with a model in which DNA gain and loss results in turnover or “churning” in regulatory element dense regions of open chromatin, where interruption of regulatory elements is selected against.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1rMm4y09CQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Reuben M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are biomarkers for several neoplastic diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a literature search, followed by experimental screening and validation in order to establish a miRNA panel in combination with the assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and to evaluate its performance in HCC diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Expression of miRNAs was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 406 serum samples from 118 Vietnamese patients with hepatitis B (HBV)-related HCC, 69 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 100 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 119 healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three miRNAs (mir-21, mir-122, mir-192) were expressed differentially among the studied subgroups and positively correlated with AFP levels. The individual miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir192 or the triplex miRNA panel showed high diagnostic accuracy for HCC (HCC vs. CHB, AUC = 0.906; HCC vs. CHB+LC, AUC = 0.81; HCC vs. CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.854). When AFP levels were ≤20ng/ml, the triplex miRNA panel still was accurate in distinguishing HCC from the other conditions (CHB, AUC = 0.922; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.836; CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.862).

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests the presence of structural changes affecting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS). The aim of this study was to characterise the RV morphology in BrS and explore associations between morphologic, clinical, electrical, and genetic parameters using non-invasive multimodality testing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive BrS patients (recruited 2013–2015) underwent clinical assessment, dedicated RV imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (unless contra-indicated), electrical assessment (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG[SAECG]) and genotyping. Morphologic data were compared to matched control and unmatched ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) cohorts, and potential associations between morphologic parameters and other variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;BrS patients (n = 42, male 86%, age 46±12 years) exhibited normal global RV volume and function, comparable to control, in contrast to significantly larger, impaired RVs in ARVC cohort (RVESV p = 0.0001; RVEDV p&amp;lt;0.0001, RVEF p = 0.002).

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests the presence of structural changes affecting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS). The aim of this study was to characterise the RV morphology in BrS and explore associations between morphologic, clinical, electrical, and genetic parameters using non-invasive multimodality testing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive BrS patients (recruited 2013–2015) underwent clinical assessment, dedicated RV imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (unless contra-indicated), electrical assessment (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG[SAECG]) and genotyping. Morphologic data were compared to matched control and unmatched ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) cohorts, and potential associations between morphologic parameters and other variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;BrS patients (n = 42, male 86%, age 46±12 years) exhibited normal global RV volume and function, comparable to control, in contrast to significantly larger, impaired RVs in ARVC cohort (RVESV p = 0.0001; RVEDV p&amp;lt;0.0001, RVEF p = 0.002). Compared with control, BrS patients exhibited larger RVOT volumes (7.4 ± 0.7 vs 5.8 ± 0.7 mL/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) (31% vs 0%, p = 0.005); compared with ARVC cohort, the RVOT volumes were similar (7.4 ± 0.7 vs, 8.1 ± 1.7, p = 0.52) and there were less RWMA (31% vs 76%, p = 0.01). Overall 67% BrS patients had abnormal RVOT morphology. Patients with abnormal RVOT tended to be older (48 ± 12 y vs 41 ± 12y, p = 0.06). Rare genetic variants were only observed in patients with abnormal RVOT morphology (36% vs 0%, p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with BrS frequently exhibit structural abnormalities localised to the RVOT and these changes may be age- and gene-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195594</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Belinda Gray</name></author><title>Relations between right ventricular morphology and clinical, electrical and genetic parameters in Brugada Syndrome</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179362a:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195594</link><published>1523653200000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00313</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00313/20180419/images/medium/bi-2018-003135_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00313&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Cell signaling is the process by which extracellular information is transmitted into the cell to perform useful biological functions. The ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) signaling controls several cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The ERK signaling pathway considered in this work starts with an extracellular stimulus and ends with activated (double phosphorylated) ERK which gets translocated into the nucleus. We model and analyze this complex pathway by decomposing it into three functional subsystems. The first subsystem spans the initial part of the pathway from the extracellular growth factor to the formation of the SOS complex, ShC-Grb2-SOS. The second subsystem includes the activation of Ras which is mediated by the SOS complex. This is followed by the MAPK subsystem (or the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) which produces the double phosphorylated ERK upon being activated by Ras. Although separate models exist in the literature at the subsystems level, a comprehensive model for the complete system including the important regulatory feedback loops is missing. Our dynamic model combines the existing subsystem models and studies their steady-state and dynamic interactions under feedback. We establish conditions under which bistability and oscillations exist for this important pathway. In particular, we show how the negative and positive feedback loops affect the dynamic characteristics that determine the cellular outcome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195513</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cc10a330</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yaman Arkun, Mohammadreza Yasemi&lt;/p&gt;

Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling causes various diseases, such as cancer and fibrosis. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are core transcription factors involved in TGF-β signaling, and they form heterotrimeric complexes with SMAD4 (SMAD2-SMAD2-SMAD4, SMAD3-SMAD3-SMAD4, and SMAD2-SMAD3-SMAD4) in response to TGF-β signaling. These heterotrimeric complexes interact with cofactors to control the expression of TGF-β–dependent genes.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To develop a simple dementia screening tool to assist primary care physicians in identifying patients with cognitive impairment among subjects with memory complaints or at a high risk for dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The Brain Health Test (BHT) was developed by several experienced neurologists, psychiatrists, and clinical psychologists in the Taiwan Dementia Society. Validation of the BHT was conducted in the memory clinics of various levels of hospitals in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Participants &lt;p&gt;All dementia patients at the memory clinics who met the inclusion criteria of age greater or equal to 50 years were enrolled. Besides the BHT, the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating were used to evaluate the cognition state of the patients and the severity of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The BHT includes two parts: a risk evaluation and a cognitive test (BHT-cog). Self or informants reports of memory decline or needing help from others to manage money or medications were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Among the risk factors evaluated in the BHT, a total risk score greater or equal to 8 was defined as a high risk for dementia. The total score for the finalized BHT-cog was 16. When the cutoff value for the BHT-cog was set to 10 for differentiating dementia and a normal mental state, the sensitivity was 91.5%, the specificity was 87.3%, the positive predictive value was 94.8%, and the negative predictive value was 80.1% The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between dementia and healthy subjects was 0.958 (95% CI = 0.941–0.975).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The BHT is a simple tool that may be useful in primary care settings to identify high-risk patients to target for cognitive screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196214</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a15cd174</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ping-Huang Tsai, Jian-Liang Liu, Ker-Neng Lin, Chiung-Chih Chang, Ming-Chyi Pai, Wen-Fu Wang, Jen-Ping Huang, Tzung-Jeng Hwang, Pei-Ning Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycotoxin produced by &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species, which is one of the main animal feed contaminants causing reproductive disorders in livestock. The aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic characteristics and ZEN removal ability of a &lt;i&gt;Bacillus licheniformis&lt;/i&gt; strain CK1. The probiotic properties, including acidic tolerance, bile salt tolerance, adherence capability, and anti-pathogenic activities of CK1 were evaluated. CK1 survived after incubation at pH 2.0 or 3.0 for 3 h, grew well in LB broth containing 0.3% oxgall, possessed adherence capability to Caco-2 cells, and inhibited the growth of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 and &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. The ZEN removal ability of CK1 was compared with a mineral mycotoxin-adsorbing agent, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), and a well-characterized biological mycotoxin-adsorbing agent, &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt; GG (LGG). At 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) containing 5 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of ZEN, the ZEN removal percentage of CK1 was 73.0%, which was significantly higher than that of HSCAS and LGG (45.9% and 48.4%, respectively). In the pH range of 2.5–8.0, CK1 removed up to 65% of ZEN. At temperatures between 4 and 42°C, CK1 removed more than 75% of ZEN. In the adsorption stability analysis, the amounts of ZEN removed by CK1 was over 30% even after five consecutive rounds of washing procedures. These findings demonstrated that CK1 displayed probiotic characteristics and removed ZEN effectively. Therefore, CK1 has a great potential for the development of feed additive to remove ZEN.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194866</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fdd5bec1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsui-Chun Hsu, Ping-Jung Yi, Ting-Yu Lee, Je-Ruei Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Different outcomes among patients hospitalized for bleeding after starting anticoagulation could influence choice of anticoagulant. We compared length of hospitalization, proportion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and 30- and 90-day mortality for adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An US commercial database of 38 million members from 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2014 was used to examine adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin (2,446), dabigatran (442), or rivaroxaban (256). Outcomes included difference in mean total length of hospitalization, proportion of ICU admissions, mean length of ICU stay, and all-cause 30- and 90-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Warfarin users were older and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression modeling with propensity score weighting showed warfarin users were hospitalized 2.0 days longer (95% CI 1.8–2.3; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than dabigatran users and 2.6 days longer (95% CI 2.4–2.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. Dabigatran users were hospitalized 0.6 days longer (95% CI 0.2–1.0; p = 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in the proportion of ICU admissions. Among ICU admissions, warfarin users stayed 3.0 days (95% CI 1.9–3.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) longer than dabigatran users and 2.4 days longer (95% CI 0.9–3.7; p = 0.003) than rivaroxaban users.

Background &lt;p&gt;Different outcomes among patients hospitalized for bleeding after starting anticoagulation could influence choice of anticoagulant. We compared length of hospitalization, proportion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and 30- and 90-day mortality for adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An US commercial database of 38 million members from 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2014 was used to examine adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin (2,446), dabigatran (442), or rivaroxaban (256). Outcomes included difference in mean total length of hospitalization, proportion of ICU admissions, mean length of ICU stay, and all-cause 30- and 90-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Warfarin users were older and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression modeling with propensity score weighting showed warfarin users were hospitalized 2.0 days longer (95% CI 1.8–2.3; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than dabigatran users and 2.6 days longer (95% CI 2.4–2.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. Dabigatran users were hospitalized 0.6 days longer (95% CI 0.2–1.0; p = 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in the proportion of ICU admissions. Among ICU admissions, warfarin users stayed 3.0 days (95% CI 1.9–3.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) longer than dabigatran users and 2.4 days longer (95% CI 0.9–3.7; p = 0.003) than rivaroxaban users. There was no difference in ICU stay between dabigatran and rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with shorter hospitalizations; however, there were no differences in 30- and 90-day mortality. These findings suggest bleeding associated with the newer agents is not more dangerous than bleeding associated with warfarin.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193912</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Blake Charlton</name></author><title>Length of hospitalization and mortality for bleeding during treatment with warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2805:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193912</link><published>1522270800000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196166</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatiane Dobrzanski, Fernanda Gravina, Bruna Steckling, Luiz R.

The intense use of herbicides for weed control in agriculture causes selection pressure on soil microbiota and water ecosystems, possibly resulting in changes to microbial processes, such as biogeochemical cycles. These xenobiotics may increase the production of reactive oxygen species and consequently affect the survival of microorganisms, which need to develop strategies to adapt to these conditions and maintain their ecological functionality. This study analyzed the adaptive responses of bacterial isolates belonging to the same species, originating from two different environments (water and soil), and subjected to selection pressure by herbicides. The effects of herbicide Callisto and its active ingredient, mesotrione, induced different adaptation strategies on the cellular, enzymatic, and structural systems of two &lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&lt;/i&gt; isolates obtained from these environments. The lipid saturation patterns observed may have affected membrane permeability in response to this herbicide. Moreover, this may have led to different levels of responses involving superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, and enzyme polymorphisms. Due to these response systems, the strain isolated from water exhibited higher growth rates than did the soil strain, in evaluations made in oligotrophic culture media, which would be more like that found in semi-pristine aquatic environments. The influence of the intracellular oxidizing environments, which changed the mode of degradation of mesotrione in our experimental model and produced different metabolites, can also be observed in soil and water at sites related to agriculture. Since the different metabolites may present different levels of toxicity, we suggest that this fact should be considered in studies on the fate of agrochemicals in different environments.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196166</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a8f8ef66</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatiane Dobrzanski, Fernanda Gravina, Bruna Steckling, Luiz R.

Recent studies have demonstrated how the competition for the finite pool of available gene expression factors has important effect on fundamental gene expression aspects. In this study, based on a whole-cell model simulation of translation in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, we evaluate for the first time the expected effect of mRNA levels fluctuations on translation due to the finite pool of ribosomes. We show that fluctuations of a single gene or a group of genes mRNA levels induce periodic behavior in all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; translation factors and aspects: the ribosomal densities and the translation rates of all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs oscillate. We numerically measure the oscillation amplitudes demonstrating that fluctuations of endogenous and heterologous genes can cause a significant fluctuation of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of the rest of the genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by synonymous mutations that oscillating the levels of mRNAs that experience high ribosomal occupancy (e.g. ribosomal “traffic jam”) induces the largest impact on the translation of the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; genome.
The results reported here should provide novel insights and principles related to the design of synthetic gene expression circuits and related to the evolutionary constraints shaping gene expression of endogenous genes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EeyF-2L0x-k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yoram Zarai, Tamir Tuller&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The aim of this investigation was to analyze the influence of the genetic variations of the -163C&gt;A polymorphism of the CYP1A2 gene on the ergogenic effects of caffeine in elite basketball players.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Nineteen elite basketball players (10 men and 9 women) ingested 3 mg⋅kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of caffeine or a placebo 60 min before performing 10 repetitions of the following series: the Abalakov jump test followed by the Change-of-Direction and Acceleration Test (CODAT). The players then competed in a 20-min simulated basketball game. Self-perceived performance and side effects were recorded by questionnaires after the trials. The effects of caffeine on basketball performance were established according to players’ CYP1A2 genotype (rs762551): AA homozygotes (n = 10) and C-allele carriers (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the 10 repetitions, caffeine increased Abalakov jump height by a mean of 2.9±3.6% in AA homozygotes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) while this effect did not reach statistical significance for C-allele carriers (2.3 ± 6.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.33). Caffeine did not affect sprint time in the CODAT test in either genotype group but it increased the number of impacts performed during the simulated game in both AA homozygotes (4.1 ± 5.3%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) and C-allele carriers (3.3 ± 3.2%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01). During the 24 h following the test, AA homozygotes tended to experience increased insomnia with caffeine while C-allele carriers did not present this effect. The remaining variables were unaffected by the genotype.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The CYP1A2 -163C&gt;A polymorphism minimally altered the ergogenicity derived from the consumption of a moderate dose of caffeine in elite basketball players.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195943</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524073508287</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f1eada87</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Puente, Javier Abián-Vicén, Juan Del Coso, Beatriz Lara, Juan José Salinero&lt;/p&gt;

Control and synchronization of fractional-order chaotic systems have attracted wide attention due to their numerous potential applications. To get suitable control method and parameters for fractional-order chaotic systems, the stability analysis of time-varying fractional-order systems should be discussed in the first place. Therefore, this paper analyzes the stability of the time-varying fractional-order systems and presents a stability theorem for the system with the order 0&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;1. This theorem is a sufficient condition which can discriminate the stability of time-varying systems conveniently. Feedback controllers are designed for control and synchronization of the fractional-order Lü chaotic system.

The incidence of cancers attributable to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) that affect males is on the rise. Currently in the UK teenage boys are not vaccinated against HPV while teenage girls are. The rationale for not vaccinating boys is that vaccinating girls should provide herd immunity to boys, however this does not protect men who have sex with men or men who have sex with unvaccinated women. The issue of whether to vaccinate boys or not is a controversial one with considerable lobbying taking place to change the existing policy. On one side of the debate are financial considerations while on the other side health equality is important. One avenue that has not been presented is the parental perspective. The current study uses a self-report questionnaire to explore what parents of teenage boys know about HPV and the vaccine and whether they want the vaccine for their sons. Only half of the parents had heard of HPV prior to completing the survey. Of those who had heard of HPV, knowledge about the health sequelae of HPV for men was poor relative to their knowledge about its impact on female health. Parents who would be willing to vaccinate their sons had higher levels of knowledge about HPV than those parents who would be unwilling or unsure. Irrespective of whether they had previously heard of HPV or not, once provided with a brief description of HPV, the majority of parents thought that boys should be offered the vaccination. There is a pressing need for public education about the potential impact of HPV on male health in order to facilitate uptake of the vaccine in the event of the vaccination programme being extended to men or to facilitate informed decision making about seeking the vaccine privately in the event that it isn’t.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195801</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b7dd58cc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susan Mary Sherman, Emma Nailer&lt;/p&gt;

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>47fe2690</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Paola Bertone, Jean-Benoît Falisse, Giuliano Russo, Sophie Witter&lt;/p&gt;

These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Maria Paola Bertone</name></author><title>Context matters (but how and why?)

Background &lt;p&gt;The management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with rate-lowering or anti-arrhythmic drugs has markedly changed over the last decade, but it is unknown how these changes have affected patients with NVAF with a permanent pacemaker (PPM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Through Danish nationwide registries, patients with NVAF and a PPM were identified from 2001 to 2012. Changes in concomitant pharmacotherapy and comorbidities were tested using the Cochran–Armitage trend test and linear regression. Patients with NVAF were identified to calculate the proportional amount of PPM implants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 12,231 NVAF patients with a PPM were included in the study, 55.6% of which were men. Median age was 78 years (interquartile range 70–84). From 2001 to 2012, the number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased from 850 to 1344, while the number of NVAF patients increased from 67,478 to 127,261. Thus, the proportional amount of NVAF patients with a PPM decreased from 1.3% to 1.1% (p = 0.015). Overall 45.9% had atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than one year and the proportion declined from 55.5% to 42.4% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Diabetes mellitus increased from 7.2% to 16.8% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Heart failure (HF) decreased from 36.7% to 29.3% (p = 0.010) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 32.4% to 26.1% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Beta-blocker use increased from 38.1% to 58.0% (p &amp;lt;0.001), while digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drug use decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the absolute number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased while the proportional amount decreased. The number of NVAF patients receiving a PPM within one year of AF diagnosis decreased. The prevalence of DM increased, while the prevalence of HF and IHD was high but decreasing. The use of beta-blockers increased markedly, while use of digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drugs decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195175</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b6d29348</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frederik Dalgaard, Martin H.

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ≥15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults. However, older adults have a higher all-cause mortality rate, perhaps partially driven by late presentation to care. Enhanced outreach and care to this group is imperative to improve their outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194047</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ed8f8d28</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jepchirchir Kiplagat, Ann Mwangi, Alfred Keter, Paula Braitstein, Edwin Sang, Joel Negin, Charles Chasela&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Governments have an ethical imperative to safeguard children in residential care institutions at all times, including in the aftermath of an emergency. Yet, a lack of accurate data about how the magnitude and characteristics of this population may change due to an emergency impedes leaders’ ability to formulate responsive policies and services, mobilize resources and foster accountability. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the feasibility of evaluating movement of children into residential care following an emergency.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The pilot study took place in Les Cayes commune in the Sud Department of Haiti in April 2017. Six months prior to the pilot, the area was severely affected by Hurricane Matthew, with widespread devastation to property, livestock and livelihoods. Using a two-stage process, the team created a comprehensive list of residential care institutions in Les Cayes. At each facility, the data collectors attempted to administer four separate tools: a group count tool, a record review tool, interviews with staff, and interviews with children 10 years of age and older.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 27 known institutions in Les Cayes, 22 institutions consented to participate in the research. Within these 22 institutions, the prevalence of new arrivals to residential care since Hurricane Matthew varied significantly across the four tools, ranging from 0.69% according to the aggregated child interviews to 20.96% according to the aggregated staff interviews. Record availability and quality was very poor and child participation was difficult to arrange due to travel and scheduling constraints.&lt;/p&gt; Interpretation &lt;p&gt;Robust measurement of new arrivals to residential care institutions was not feasible in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew. Moreover, many of the challenges encountered are likely to be encountered in humanitarian emergencies in other settings. Therefore, the research team does not recommend scale-up of these methods in most humanitarian settings. Alternative approaches that incorporate household survey methods to ascertain movement into residential care based on reports from caregivers may be more realistic in places with poor pre-existing governance systems and weak registries and records for residential care institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195515</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>87374801</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beth L.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different types of bone conduction transducers with different physical and electro-acoustic properties are available for audiometric hearing threshold measurements.

Genetic variability in insect vectors is valuable to study vector competence determinants and to select non-vector populations that may help reduce the spread of vector-borne pathogens. We collected and tested vector competency of 15 isofemale lines of Asian citrus psyllid, &lt;i&gt;Diaphorina citri&lt;/i&gt;, vector of ‘&lt;i&gt;Candidatus&lt;/i&gt; Liberibacter asiaticus’ (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las is associated with huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults were collected from orange jasmine (&lt;i&gt;Murraya paniculata&lt;/i&gt;) hedges in Florida, and individual pairs (females and males) were caged on healthy &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants for egg laying. The progeny from each pair that tested &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-negative by qPCR were maintained on &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants and considered an isofemale line. Six acquisition tests on &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults that were reared as nymphs on &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-infected citrus, from various generations of each line, were conducted to assess their acquisition rates (percentage of qPCR-positive adults). Three lines with mean acquisition rates of 28 to 32%, were classified as ‘good’ acquirers and three other lines were classified as ‘poor’ acquirers, with only 5 to 8% acquisition rates. All lines were further tested for their ability to inoculate &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by confining &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-exposed psyllids for one week onto healthy citrus leaves (6–10 adults/leaf/week), and testing the leaves for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by qPCR. Mean inoculation rates were 19 to 28% for the three good acquirer lines and 0 to 3% for the three poor acquirer lines. Statistical analyses indicated positive correlations between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition and inoculation rates, as well as between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las titer in the psyllids and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition or inoculation rates. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of one of the good and one of the poor acquirer lines revealed differences between them in color morphs and hemocyanin expression, but not the composition of bacterial endosymbionts.

Genetic modification of Cry-proteins from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)&lt;/i&gt; is a common practice in economically important crops to improve insecticide resistance and reduce the use of pesticides. However, introduction of these genes can have unintended side effects, which should be closely monitored for effective breeding and crop management. To determine the potential cause of these negative effects, we explored assimilate partitioning in the transgenic &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; rice line T1c-19 (&lt;i&gt;Cry1C*&lt;/i&gt;), which was compared with that of its wild-type counterpart Minghui 63 (MH63) under different potassium fertilization application treatment conditions. In a pot experiment, 0, 0.4, and 0.6 g K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was applied per kg of dry soil to determine the phloem transport characteristics of the two rice lines. We used a variety of assessment indicators ranging from morphological to physiological aspects, including the number of large and small vascular bundles in the neck internode at the heading stage, the diameter and bleeding intensity of the neck internode at the filling stage, and the content and apparent ratio of transferred non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in the culm and sheath from the heading to maturing stages. The K utilization and grain yield at the maturing stage were also concerned. Results presented that the mean setting rate and grain yield of T1c-19 (&lt;i&gt;Cry1C*&lt;/i&gt;) decreased by 22.3% and 26.2% compared to those in MH63, respectively. Compared to MH63, the K concentration and accumulation were significantly higher in the culms and leaves, but significantly lower in grain of T1c-19 (&lt;i&gt;Cry1C*&lt;/i&gt;). T1c-19 (&lt;i&gt;Cry1C*&lt;/i&gt;) had less apparent NSC efflux in the culm and sheath, fewer small vascular bundles, and a smaller diameter and bleeding intensity of the neck internode than MH63. In addition, linear correlation analysis indicated that there were positive correlations among grain yield, setting rate, the apparent NSC efflux in the culm and sheath, number of small vascular bundles, and the neck internode diameter and bleeding intensity.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD) is a dilatative arteriopathy associated with intracerebral hemorrhage. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the frequency and anatomical distribution of cerebral microbleeds (cMBs) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in VBD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From a MRI database 94 VBD patients were identified and analyzed with special emphasis on cMBs and ICH on T2*-weighted gradient echo images (GRE) in relation to the established diagnostic MRI criteria of VBD (diameter, height, and lateral position). cMBs/ICH location was categorized into anterior/posterior circulation. Clinical information like demographic details, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities were abstracted from the case records. An extensive modelling approach using generalized linear mixed-effects models was used.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 79 (84.0%) patients (mean age 72.1±10.0 years, 74.7% male) with a standard stroke MRI protocol including T2*-weighted images were included in the analysis. cMBs were observed in 38/79 (48.1%) patients, ranging from 1 to 84 cMBs per patient. In the posterior circulation cMBs were observed more frequently (34/38 (89.5%)) in comparison to the anterior circulation (24/38 (63.2%)). cMBs were observed in the thalamus in 20/38 (52.6%), hippocampus in 1/38 (2.6%), occipital lobe in 18/38 (47.4%), pons in 6/38 (15.8%), medulla oblongata in 2/38 (5.2%), and cerebellum in 14/38 (36.8%) patients. ICH was observed in only 6/79 (7.6%) patients. There were significantly more cMBs in the posterior- (NCMBs-PC = 1.717, 95%CI: 1.336–2.208, p = 0.0315) than in the anterior circulation.Logistic regression model showed a significant positive effect of clinical symptoms such as ischemic, TIA and hemorrhagic stroke on the presence of cMBs (OR = 3.34, 95%CI [2.0–5.57], p = 0.0184; ndf = 78, AIC = 107.51).General linear model showed that clinical symptoms have a highly significant effect on the number of cMBs (N = 2.78, 95%CI [2.51–3.07], p&amp;lt;2*10–16; ndf = 78, AIC = 1218).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;cMBs and ICH may be observed in the anterior and posterior circulation in VBD but they occur more frequently in the posterior circulation. Most common anatomical locations of cMBs in VBD were the thalamus, occipital lobe and cerebellum.

A consistent determinant of the establishment success of alien species appears to be the number of individuals that are introduced to found a population (propagule pressure), yet variation in the form of this relationship has been largely unexplored. Here, we present the first quantitative systematic review of this form, using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success has been evaluated for a broad range of taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants and long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. We found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success to be a feature of every hypothesis we tested. However, establishment success most critically depended on propagule pressures in the range of 10–100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions.

A consistent determinant of the establishment success of alien species appears to be the number of individuals that are introduced to found a population (propagule pressure), yet variation in the form of this relationship has been largely unexplored. Here, we present the first quantitative systematic review of this form, using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success has been evaluated for a broad range of taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants and long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. We found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success to be a feature of every hypothesis we tested. However, establishment success most critically depended on propagule pressures in the range of 10–100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. Conversely, no variation was accounted for in any analysis by the scale of study (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used. Our analyses reveal remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7aUJblC5EI4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4cac2389</fingerprint><recrawled>1524507070083</recrawled><crawled>1524506647314</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><title>Dissecting the null model for biological invasions: A meta-analysis of the propagule pressure effect</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005987</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/7aUJblC5EI4/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Phillip Cassey</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>0.07</engagementRate><engagement>1</engagement><updated>1524517200000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f3ad5b12:38e8b5:76251cdd</id><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005987</link><published>1524517200000</published></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3680.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Discovering the genetic changes underlying species differences is a central goal in evolutionary genetics.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive weakness of the skeletal and cardiac muscles. This X-linked disorder is caused by open reading frame disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in strong reduction or complete absence of dystrophin protein. In order to use dystrophin as a supportive or even surrogate biomarker in clinical studies on investigational drugs aiming at correcting the primary cause of the disease, the ability to reliably quantify dystrophin expression in muscle biopsies of DMD patients pre- and post-treatment is essential. Here we demonstrate the application of the ProteinSimple capillary immunoassay (Wes) method, a gel- and blot-free method requiring less sample, antibody and time to run than conventional Western blot assay. We optimized dystrophin quantification by Wes using 2 different antibodies and found it to be highly sensitive, reproducible and quantitative over a large dynamic range. Using a healthy control muscle sample as a reference and α-actinin as a protein loading/muscle content control, a panel of skeletal muscle samples consisting of 31 healthy controls, 25 Becker Muscle dystrophy (BMD) and 17 DMD samples was subjected to Wes analysis. In healthy controls dystrophin levels varied 3 to 5-fold between the highest and lowest muscle samples, with the reference sample representing the average of all 31 samples. In BMD muscle samples dystrophin levels ranged from 10% to 90%, with an average of 33% of the healthy muscle average, while for the DMD samples the average dystrophin level was 1.3%, ranging from 0.7% to 7% of the healthy muscle average. In conclusion, Wes is a suitable, efficient and reliable method for quantification of dystrophin expression as a biomarker in DMD clinical drug development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195850</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>980c2f6c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chantal Beekman, Anneke A.

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f0df1a15</fingerprint><recrawled>1522095842894</recrawled><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><title>A mechanistic pan-cancer pathway model informed by multi-omics data interprets stochastic cell fate responses to drugs and mitogens</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/w6d_RFwOJFE/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Mehdi Bouhaddou</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522098000000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b6:a077e55f</id><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</link><published>1522098000000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195122</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Genmin Lu, Polly Pine, Janet M.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Increasing use of factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors necessitates effective reversal agents to manage bleeding. Andexanet alfa, a novel modified recombinant human FXa, rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct and indirect FXa inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the ability of andexanet to reverse anticoagulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and reduce bleeding in rabbits administered edoxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies characterized the interaction of andexanet with edoxaban and its ability to reverse edoxaban-mediated anti-FXa activity. In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa. Andexanet rapidly and dose-dependently reversed the effects of edoxaban on FXa activity and coagulation pharmacodynamic parameters &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In edoxaban-anticoagulated rabbits, andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity by 82% (from 548±87 to 100±41 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), mean unbound edoxaban plasma concentration by ~80% (from 100±10 to 21±6 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), and blood loss by 80% vs. vehicle (adjusted for control, 2.6 vs. 12.9 g; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). The reduction in blood loss correlated with the decrease in anti-FXa activity (r = 0.6993, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and unbound edoxaban (r = 0.5951, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0035).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that andexanet rapidly reversed the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban, suggesting it could be clinically valuable for the management of acute and surgery-related bleeding. Correlation of blood loss with anti-FXa activity supports the use of anti-FXa activity as a biomarker for assessing anticoagulation reversal in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195122</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>aeea7a8c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Genmin Lu, Polly Pine, Janet M.

In recent years, acupuncture has gained in popularity worldwide. However, recent epidemiological studies are lacking. We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients who were female, were middle-aged, resided in highly urbanized areas and suffered from injury or disorders of the musculoskeletal system were prone to more frequent acupuncture use. Our study revealed that the utilization of acupuncture became increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. Our findings may provide useful information for clinical practice and research as well as for health policy decision making.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195490</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>95378d3e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mei-Yao Wu, Yu-Chen Lee, Cheng-Li Lin, Ming-Cheng Huang, Mao-Feng Sun, Hung-Rong Yen&lt;/p&gt;

We examine the seasonality of asthma-related hospital admissions in Melbourne, Australia, in particular the contribution and predictability of episodic thunderstorm asthma. Using a time-series ecological approach based on asthma admissions to Melbourne metropolitan hospitals, we identified seasonal peaks in asthma admissions that were centred in late February, June and mid-November. These peaks were most likely due to the return to school, winter viral infections and seasonal allergies, respectively. We performed non-linear statistical regression to predict daily admission rates as functions of the seasonal cycle, weather conditions, reported thunderstorms, pollen counts and air quality. Important predictor variables were the seasonal cycle and mean relative humidity in the preceding two weeks, with higher humidity associated with higher asthma admissions. Although various attempts were made to model asthma admissions, none of the models explained substantially more variation above that associated with the annual cycle. We also identified a list of high asthma admissions days (HAADs). Most HAADs fell in the late-February return-to-school peak and the November allergy peak, with the latter containing the greatest number of daily admissions. Many HAADs in the spring allergy peak may represent episodes of thunderstorm asthma, as they were associated with rainfall, thunderstorms, high ambient grass pollen levels and high humidity, a finding that suggests thunderstorm asthma is a recurrent phenomenon in Melbourne that occurs roughly once per five years. The rarity of thunderstorm asthma events makes prediction challenging, underscoring the importance of maintaining high standards of asthma management, both for patients and health professionals, especially during late spring and early summer.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194929</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>684bff51</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeremy D.

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hb&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA or protein.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The transcription factor SOX2 has been identified as a lineage survival oncogene in squamous cell carcinoma and copy number gain is a common event in several human malignancies including head and neck cancer. However, the regulation and function of SOX2 during carcinogenesis as well as its prognostic value appears to be highly context dependent. As an example, high SOX2 expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is related to a favorable prognosis, while it is associated with poor outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. More recently, higher SOX2 levels and improved survival was also reported for head and neck SCC (HNSCC), and silencing of SOX2 expression in HNSCC cell lines revealed a mesenchymal-like phenotype with prominent vimentin expression. So far, SOX2 expression and its clinical relevance for other head and neck cancers, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (HNACC) have not been sufficiently investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;SOX2, vimentin and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining on serial sections from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples of a patient cohort (n = 45) with primary ACC and correlated with patient and tumor characteristics as well as survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;High SOX2 expression was found in 14 (31%) primary tumor specimens and was significantly correlated with a N0 lymph node status (p = 0.04), while low SOX2 expression was correlated with a solid growth pattern (p = 0.031).

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The transcription factor SOX2 has been identified as a lineage survival oncogene in squamous cell carcinoma and copy number gain is a common event in several human malignancies including head and neck cancer. However, the regulation and function of SOX2 during carcinogenesis as well as its prognostic value appears to be highly context dependent. As an example, high SOX2 expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is related to a favorable prognosis, while it is associated with poor outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. More recently, higher SOX2 levels and improved survival was also reported for head and neck SCC (HNSCC), and silencing of SOX2 expression in HNSCC cell lines revealed a mesenchymal-like phenotype with prominent vimentin expression. So far, SOX2 expression and its clinical relevance for other head and neck cancers, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (HNACC) have not been sufficiently investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;SOX2, vimentin and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining on serial sections from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples of a patient cohort (n = 45) with primary ACC and correlated with patient and tumor characteristics as well as survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;High SOX2 expression was found in 14 (31%) primary tumor specimens and was significantly correlated with a N0 lymph node status (p = 0.04), while low SOX2 expression was correlated with a solid growth pattern (p = 0.031). Of the 45 patients, 27 tumor samples resembled an EMT-like phenotype, as assessed by high vimentin and low E-cadherin levels. However, in HNACC SOX2 levels were neither correlated with vimentin nor with E-cadherin expression, further supporting a context dependent regulation and function of SOX2 in distinct tumor entities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The absence of SOX2 was predominantly found in solid HNACC, which are characterized by a more aggressive phenotype in ACC.

Contraction of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) isolated from pulmonary arterial hypertensive (PAH) and normal (non-PAH) subject lungs was determined and measured with real-time electrical impedance. Treatment of HPASMC with vasoactive peptides, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and bradykinin (BK) but not angiotensin II, induced a temporal decrease in the electrical impedance profile mirroring constrictive morphological change of the cells which typically was more robust in PAH as opposed to non-PAH cells. Inhibition with LIMKi3 and a cofilin targeted motif mimicking cell permeable peptide (MMCPP) had no effect on ET-1 induced HPASMC contraction indicating a negligible role for these actin regulatory proteins. On the other hand, a MMCPP blocking the activity of caldesmon reduced ET-1 promoted contraction pointing to a regulatory role of this protein and its activation pathway in HPASMC contraction. Inhibition of this MEK/ERK/p90RSK pathway, which is an upstream regulator of caldesmon phosphorylation, reduced ET-1 induced cell contraction. While the regulation of ET-1 induced cell contraction was found to be similar in PAH and non-PAH cells, a key difference was the response to pharmacological inhibitors and to siRNA knockdown of Rho kinases (ROCK1/ROCK2). The PAH cells required much higher concentrations of inhibitors to abrogate ET-1 induced contractions and their contraction was not affected by siRNA against either ROCK1 or ROCK2. Lastly, blocking of L-type and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels had no effect on ET-1 or BK induced contraction. However, inhibiting the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase blunted ET-1 and BK induced HPASMC contraction in both PAH and non-PAH derived HPASMC. In summary, our findings here together with previous communications illustrate similarities and differences in the regulation PAH and non-PAH smooth muscle cell contraction relating to calcium translocation, RhoA/ROCK signaling and the activity of caldesmon. These findings may provide useful tools in achieving the regulation of the vascular hypercontractility taking place in PAH.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195780</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>64c6b76d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jamie L.

Context &lt;p&gt;Obese patients are raising specific questions in emergency care such as equipment issues or urgent procedures. Even though obesity prevalence and subsequent health expenditure are increasing worldwide, there is scarce literature about their specific resource utilization of Emergency Departments (ED). These few studies do not take into account both socio-economic situation and comorbidities which are well-known factors influencing healthcare use. Our objective was to assess the emergency care resource utilization of obese individuals (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to normal-weight individuals taking into account comorbidities and social-economic situations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The French CONSTANCES epidemiologic cohort is a randomly selected sample of French adults. Participants data are linked to the National Health Insurance Database collecting all medical acts. The rate of ED visits of obese (and each obesity class) and normal-weight participants were compared considering confounding factors (comorbidities, various socio-economic data). The primary endpoint was to have visited the ED between 2010 and 2013. Sex-separated analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were performed and adjusted odds-ratios [OR] (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 21,035 normal-weight and 5,003 obese participants. Obese participants visited the ED more often than normal-weight participants (men: 30.5% vs. 26.7%; women: 30.3% vs. 24.4%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Obese participants presented more comorbidities and a lower socio-economic situation than normal-weight participants. After adjustment, obese participants had a higher risk of visiting ED (men: OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.04–1.33; and women: OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.22–1.52), with a higher risk for class III participants (BMI ≥ 40 kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) (men: OR = 2.18; CI 95%: 1.32–3.63; and women: OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.38–2.49).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Obese individuals have a higher level of emergency care resource utilization than normal-weight individuals and it increases with severe obesity.

Defective signal transductions, which are associated with protein phosphorylation, have been revealed to link to many human diseases, such as cancer. Defining the organization of the phosphorylation-based signaling network and, in particular, identifying kinase-specific substrates can help reveal the molecular mechanism of the signaling network.

Defective signal transductions, which are associated with protein phosphorylation, have been revealed to link to many human diseases, such as cancer. Defining the organization of the phosphorylation-based signaling network and, in particular, identifying kinase-specific substrates can help reveal the molecular mechanism of the signaling network.

Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based high-performance accelerometers are ubiquitously used in various electronic devices. However, there is an existing need to detect physical impacts using low-cost devices with no electronic circuits or a battery. We designed and fabricated an impact sensor prototype using a commercial stereolithography apparatus that only consists of a plastic housing and working fluids. The sensor device responds to the instantaneous acceleration (impact) by deformation and pinch off of a water droplet that is suspended in oil in a sensor cavity. We tested the various geometrical and physical parameters of the impact sensor to identify their relations to threshold acceleration values. We show that the state diagram that is plotted against the dimensionless Archimedes and Bond numbers adequately describes the response of the proposed sensor.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195741</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5457793e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daigo Takahashi, Keisuke Hara, Taiji Okano, Hiroaki Suzuki&lt;/p&gt;

Current approaches for DNA extraction and fragmentation from mammalian spermatozoa provide several challenges for the investigation of the oxidative stress burden carried in the genome of male gametes. Indeed, the potential introduction of oxidative DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species, reducing agents (dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol), and DNA shearing techniques used in the preparation of samples for chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing serve to cofound the reliability and accuracy of the results obtained. Here we report optimised methodology that minimises, or completely eliminates, exposure to DNA damaging compounds during extraction and fragmentation procedures. Specifically, we show that Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion prior to cellular lysis generates a greater DNA yield with minimal collateral oxidation while randomly fragmenting the entire paternal genome. This modified methodology represents a significant improvement over traditional fragmentation achieved via sonication in the preparation of genomic DNA from human spermatozoa for downstream applications, such as next-generation sequencing. We also present a redesigned bioinformatic pipeline framework adjusted to correctly analyse this form of data and detect statistically relevant targets of oxidation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195003</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3c8ddf1a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel J.

We also present a redesigned bioinformatic pipeline framework adjusted to correctly analyse this form of data and detect statistically relevant targets of oxidation.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195003</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Miguel J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Vascular calcification is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. However, no viable treatments for this condition have been identified. This study aimed to determine whether farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) can reduce vascular calcification and the mechanism by which this reduction occurs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that FTI-277 significantly inhibits phosphate-induced mineral deposition by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, prevents VSMC osteogenic differentiation, and increases mRNA expression of matrix Gla protein (MGP), an inhibitor of mineralization. FTI-277 increases Akt signaling in VSMC in short-term serum-stimulation assays and in long-term mineralization assays. In contrast, manumycin A has no effect on Akt signaling or mineralization. Co-incubation of VSMC with FTI-277 and SH6 (an Akt inhibitor) significantly reduces the inhibitory effect of FTI-277 on mineralization, demonstrating that FTI-277 inhibits calcification by activating Akt signaling. Over-expression of the constitutively active p110 sub-unit of PI3K in VSMC using adenovirus activates Akt, inhibits mineralization, suppresses VSMC differentiation and significantly enhances MGP mRNA expression. FTI-277 also inhibits phosphate-induced activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis of VSMC, and these effects are negated by co-incubation with SH6. Finally, using an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; model of vascular calcification, we demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits high phosphate-induced mineralization in aortic rings derived from rats with end-stage renal failure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Together, these results demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits VSMC mineral deposition by up-regulating PI3K/Akt signaling and preventing apoptosis, suggesting that targeting farnesylation, or Akt specifically, may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of vascular calcification.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196232</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>591c9e3f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arvind Ponnusamy, Smeeta Sinha, Gareth D.

Gut bacterial communities have been shown to be influenced by diet, host phylogeny and anatomy, but most of these studies have been done in captive animals. Here we compare the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of wild birds. We characterized the gizzard and intestinal microbiota among 8 wild Neotropical bird species, granivorous or frugivorous species of the orders Columbiformes and Passeriformes. We sequenced the V4 region of the &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene in 94 collected samples from 32 wild birds from 5 localities, and compared bacterial communities by foraging guild, organ, locality and bird taxonomy. &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene-based sequencing data were examined using QIIME with linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and metabolic pathways were predicted using PICRUSt algorism. We identified 8 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Beta diversity analyses indicated significant separation of gut communities by bird orders (Columbiformes vs. Passerifomes) and between bird species (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In lower intestine, PICRUSt shows a predominance of carbohydrate metabolism in granivorous birds and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in frugivorous birds. Gizzard microbiota was significantly richer in granivorous, in relation to frugivorous birds (Chao 1; non-parametric t-test, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), suggesting a microbial gizzard function, beyond grinding food. The results suggest that the most important factor separating the bacterial community structure was bird taxonomy, followed by foraging guild. However, variation between localities is also likely to be important, but this could not been assessed with our study design.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194857</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e8e282f4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Diagnosing HIV and/or TB is not sufficient; linkage to care and treatment is conditional to reduce the burden of disease. This study aimed to determine factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based services in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected data from clients who utilized stand-alone (fixed site not attached to a health facility) and mobile HIV testing services in eight communities in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan district, between January 2008 and June 2012. Clients were included in the analysis if they were ≥12 years and had a known HIV status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to assess the association between determinants (sex, age, HIV testing service and co-infection status) and self-reported linkage to HIV care and/or TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Linkage to HIV care was 3 738/5 929 (63.1%). Linkage to HIV care was associated with the type of HIV testing service. Clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services had a significantly reduced odds of linking to HIV care (aOR 0.7 (CI 95%: 0.6–0.8), p&amp;lt;0.001. Linkage to TB treatment was 210/275 (76.4%). Linkage to TB treatment was not associated with sex and service type, but was associated with age. Clients in older age groups were less likely to link to TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years (all, p-value&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A large proportion of clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services did not link to care. Almost a quarter of clients diagnosed with TB did not link to treatment. Integrated community-based HIV and TB testing services are efficient in diagnosing HIV and TB, but strategies to improve linkage to care are required to control these epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195208</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>68002b94</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sue-Ann Meehan, Rosa Sloot, Heather R.

Clients in older age groups were less likely to link to TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years (all, p-value&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A large proportion of clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services did not link to care. Almost a quarter of clients diagnosed with TB did not link to treatment. Integrated community-based HIV and TB testing services are efficient in diagnosing HIV and TB, but strategies to improve linkage to care are required to control these epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195208</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Sue-Ann Meehan</name></author><title>Factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based HIV testing services in Cape Town, South Africa</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522702800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692c:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195208</link><published>1522702800000</published></item><item><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13475</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;If you look at any collection of “common myths about cancer”, you will probably find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20046762&quot;&gt;reassurances&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/myths&quot;&gt;the idea&lt;/a&gt; that having cancer surgery might cause the cancer to spread to other parts of the body. I remember coming across this one some years ago being surprised – I’d never heard that one myself, but it was apparently a pretty widespread fear. You could imagine a situation where tumor cells are mechanically detached and could spread, but that’s actually less likely than it might seem, since not all of these cells can actually attach somewhere else and start growing again (although there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html&quot;&gt;special situations&lt;/a&gt; where such disturbance, even to the level of taking a biopsy sample, is known to be risky).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t know enough about, though, is an effect seen in breast cancer treatment. After surgery, the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer peaks about 12 to 18 months later. It’s not a sure thing, fortunately, but it’s definitely a real effect, and one that would certainly lead to people thinking that the surgery had (somehow) spread the cancer around. That’s actually a pretty reasonable hypothesis, given the observations, so that particular “common myth” has something behind it. But how? The same effect is noted in patients who have undergone complete mastectomy, which doesn’t disturb the tumor tissue itself much (or at all). Alternatively, were these actively growing tumors that had spread before the surgery and were just too small to detect? Some have argued for this explanation, and it’s hard to disprove. There’s yet another plausible mechanism: these tumor cells might have had already spread before the surgery, but were somehow not growing, and something happened to change that. What is it about surgery that would allow them to start growing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/436/eaan3464&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has what may well be the answer. Studying the effects of surgery in mouse models of metastatic cancer, it appears that the post-surgical wound healing response is the culprit. There appears to be an ongoing T-cell response that is holding down these potential metastatic tumors, but it’s disrupted by the inflammation response after surgery. Expressing GFP in murine mammary tumors and then injecting these into other (syngenic) mice caused a T-cell response to the GFP itself, and ultimately the tumors were rejected by the immune system. But surgically wounding these mice triggered an outgrowth of the tumors instead, probably through the actions of inflammatory monocytes (which differentiate into macrophages inside the tumor tissue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s even more interesting is that these effects can be abrogated &lt;em&gt;simply by treating the mice with NSAIDs to damp down the inflammation response&lt;/em&gt;. To avoid interactions between the tumor cells and the anti-inflammatory drugs, the procedure was to do the surgical wounding (with and without NSAID treatment with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meloxicam&quot;&gt;meloxicam&lt;/a&gt;) several days before the tumor cells were even injected, with time enough to clear the system out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notably, treatment with meloxicam did not appear to impede wound healing in these mice. Seven days after surgical wounding (4 days after the cessation of either meloxicam or saline treatment), D2A1-GFP cells were orthotopically injected contralateral to the wound site. Meloxicam treatment had no effect on tumor growth in the absence of surgical wounding (Fig. 4G, left). In contrast, in wounded groups, tumors in meloxicam-treated mice were significantly smaller than tumors in wounded mice treated with saline (P &amp;lt; 0.05; Fig. 4G, right). Surprisingly, tumors in wounded, meloxicam-treated mice were even smaller than tumors in unwounded, untreated mice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there had been a retrospective study of breast cancer patients that suggested that treatment with NSAIDs seemed to reduce the metastatic events, but no one was sure if that was a direct mechanistic effect on pre-existing tumors, or on their possible activation. These results, though, suggest that it really is an activation mechanism, and that patients should be treated with NSAIDs in just this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We undertook to model a clinical phenomenon that occurs at low frequency and arises only with delayed kinetics in patients. We therefore used hundreds of mice to ensure that we had sufficient statistical power to draw firm conclusions. In considering these conclusions, we do not wish to suggest that tumor resection surgery be avoided because of the potentially negative side effects suggested previously by clinical data and demonstrated here experimentally. Instead, we argue that coupling surgery with short-term anti-inflammatory treatments may substantially improve patient outcomes by mitigating the systemic consequences of surgical breast cancer resection. Of critical importance, perioperative treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam potently inhibited the impact of wounding on tumor growth. Furthermore, our study suggests that the treatment of breast cancer patients with anti-inflammatory agents during and after surgical resection of primary tumors may yield substantial benefits by reducing the incidence of early metastatic relapse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no reason for this not to immediately move into clinical practice, and I hope that this paper gets widely noticed. NSAID therapy is cheap and well-tolerated, and the risk/benefit ratio would seem to be about as good as it can get. So in general, untangling the relationships of the immune system with cancer is continuing to provide results – both in turning the immune response up and (in this case) turning it down. That process is most definitely going to continue. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of combined use of salivary gland ultrasonography (US) and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatic Disease (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for improving the diagnostic efficiency in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). A US-based salivary gland disease grading system was developed using a cohort comprising 213 SS or non-SS patients who fulfilled the minimum requirements for classifying SS based on the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria. Using 62 SS or non-SS patients from the 213 patients and who had also undergone all the 5 examinations needed for the ACR/EULAR classification, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications for diagnosing SS, using the clinical diagnosis of SS by rheumatologists as the gold standard. The ACR/EULAR criteria discriminated clinical SS patients with 77% and 79% accuracy for those with primary or secondary SS and for those with primary SS, respectively. However, the integrated score system of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications yielded 92% and 93% accuracy for these 2 SS patient groups, respectively, provided that US score of 3 was assigned to patients with US grade ≥2, and then patients with integrated threshold score of ≥5 were diagnosed as SS. Cross-validation also indicated improved accuracy of the integrated ACR/EULAR and US score system (91.9 and 93.0% for primary/secondary and primary SS patients, respectively) over that by the ACR/EULAR criteria alone. (74.2 and 86.0%, respectively).

The presence of the photoremovable protecting group (PRPG) introduced at a relevant position for integrin recognition, temporally inhibits ligand bioactivity. Light exposure at cell-compatible dose efficiently cleaves the PRPG and restores functionality.

The presence of the photoremovable protecting group (PRPG) introduced at a relevant position for integrin recognition, temporally inhibits ligand bioactivity. Light exposure at cell-compatible dose efficiently cleaves the PRPG and restores functionality. Selective cell response (attachment, spreading, migration) to the activated ligand on the surface is achieved upon controlled exposure. Spatial and temporal control of the cellular response is demonstrated, including the possibility to in situ activation.

The relapse of nasal deformity is a challenge for modern correction of cleft lip. A comprehensive understanding in the biomechanical perspective of both the formation and correction of the cleft lip nasal deformity would lead to improved stability of the corrective outcome. In this study, a finite element model of secondary cleft lip nasal deformity was constructed, on which two critical corrective maneuvers were mimicked in the form of force-loading. The intercrural suture was simulated by a force loaded at the intermediate crus of the alar cartilage directing anteriorly and medially, and the suture suspending the alar cartilage to the upper lateral cartilage was simulated by a force loaded at the lateral crus directing superiorly and medially. The equivalent von-mises stress and the total deformation consequent to different patterns of loading were captured. Our biomechanical analyses suggested that the intercrural suture at the nasal tip might be more effective in generating widespread morphological change than the suspension suture, but left much higher level of stress within the skin envelope if placed too high. Synergistic effect was observed between the two sutures in both the resultant deformation and stress. In addition, our simulations were partially supported by clinical photogrammetry data.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>940c8d61</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyao Huang, Yeping Li, Xiangyou Luo, Xu Cheng, Bing Shi, Jingtao Li&lt;/p&gt;

To examine effects of scan duration on estimates of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS), we reanalyzed data from thirty-nine previously reported L-[1-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]leucine PET studies. Subjects consisted of 12 healthy volunteers studied twice, awake and under propofol sedation, and 15 subjects with fragile X syndrome (FXS) studied once under propofol sedation. All scans were acquired on a high resolution scanner. We used a basis function method for voxelwise estimation of parameters of the kinetic model of L-[1-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]leucine and rCPS over the interval beginning at the time of tracer injection and ending 30, 45, 60, 75 or 90 min later. For each study and scan interval, regional estimates in nine regions and whole brain were obtained by averaging voxelwise estimates over all voxels in the region. In all three groups rCPS was only slightly affected by scan interval length and was very stable between 60 and 90 min. Furthermore, statistical comparisons of rCPS between awake and sedated healthy volunteers provided almost identical results when they were based on 60 min scan data as when they were based on data from the full 90 min interval. Statistical comparisons between sedated healthy volunteers and sedated subjects with FXS also yielded almost identical results when based on 60 and 90 min scan intervals. We conclude that, under the conditions of our studies, scan duration can be shortened to 60 min without loss of precision.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195580</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>89206578</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Giampaolo Tomasi, Mattia Veronese, Alessandra Bertoldo, Carolyn Beebe Smith, Kathleen C.

We conclude that, under the conditions of our studies, scan duration can be shortened to 60 min without loss of precision.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195580</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Giampaolo Tomasi</name></author><title>Effects of shortened scanning intervals on calculated regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis determined with the L-[1-&amp;lt;sup&gt;11&amp;lt;/sup&gt;C]leucine PET method</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ad9:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195580</link><published>1523912400000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25495</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is plasticity caused by single genes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is plasticity caused by single genes?, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25495&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nature25495&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Is plasticity caused by single genes?</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>668</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nature25495-f1.jpg</url><width>685</width></visual><crawled>1522256354648</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7aa165b6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is plasticity caused by single genes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is plasticity caused by single genes?, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25495&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nature25495&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Is plasticity caused by single genes?</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25495</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>J. van Gestel</name></author><title>Is plasticity caused by single genes?</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>27</engagement><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1626d8c9d58:6c4a593:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25495</link><published>1522220400000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005994</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian S.

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world’s largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Brian S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Inequalities in health among groups of various socio-economic status (as measured by education, occupation, and income) constitute one of the main challenges for public health. Since 2006, the Lazio Regional Outcome Evaluation Program (P.Re.Val.E.), presents a set of indicators of hospital performance based on quality standards driven by strong clinical recommendations, and measures the variation in the access to effective health care for different population groups and providers in the Lazio Region. One of the aims of the program was to compare population subgroups in order to promote equity in service provision. Since June 2013, a new management strategy has been put in place that assigned specific goals based on performance assessment to the chief executive officers of the hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether, in recent years, there has been a reduction in the differential access to effective health care, among individuals with different educational levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We enrolled all patients discharged from both public and private hospitals of the Lazio region between 2012 and 2015, living in Lazio region. We analysed the proportion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes (primary PCI), the proportion of patients with hip fracture (HF) who underwent surgery within 2 days, and the proportion of women with primary C-section. We applied multivariate logistic regression models to assess the effect of educational level on health outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities that could affect the outcomes. For each year of the study period, we compared adjusted proportions of outcomes for the highest and the lowest level of education by using percentage differences.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, 44.6% of STEMI patients (N = 3,299) were treated with primary PCI, 54.4% of patients with hip fractures (N = 6,602) underwent surgery within 2 days, and 27.7% of women without a previous C-section (N = 34,718) delivered via C-section, in 2015. The corresponding proportions in 2012 were 27.8%, 31.3% and 31.5%, respectively. By comparing the adjusted proportions in patients with the highest education level (a university degree or higher) to those with the lowest level education level (None/Primary school), a decrease in the percentage difference was observed during the study period. In STEMI and delivery cohorts, the improvement of outcomes involved the least and the most educated patients, respectively, and the difference between the two educational levels was close to zero in 2015, whereas for hip patients, the improvement was more evident among the less educated patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, we observed a reduction in the differential access to effective heath care by educational level, in different clinical areas. Different factors might explain these results. On top of the public disclosure of outcome data, the management strategy applied in mid-2013 might have driven the overall improvement of the health system for the considered conditions, helping to achieve a fairer access to health.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194972</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bf9aff61</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Ventura, Danilo Fusco, Katia Bontempi, Paola Colais, Marina Davoli&lt;/p&gt;

However, compared to bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell expression profiles are extremely noisy, as they only capture a fraction of the transcripts present in the cell. Here, we propose the k-nearest neighbor smoothing (kNN-smoothing) algorithm, designed to reduce noise by aggregating information from similar cells (neighbors) in a computationally efficient and statistically tractable manner. The algorithm is based on the observation that across protocols, the technical noise exhibited by UMI-filtered scRNA-Seq data closely follows Poisson statistics. Smoothing is performed by first identifying the nearest neighbors of each cell in a step-wise fashion, based on partially smoothed and variance-stabilized expression profiles, and then aggregating their transcript counts. We show that kNN-smoothing greatly improves the detection of clusters of cells and co-expressed genes, and clearly outperforms other smoothing methods on simulated data. To accurately perform smoothing for datasets containing highly similar cell populations, we propose the kNN-smoothing 2 algorithm, in which neighbors are determined after projecting the partially smoothed data onto the first few principal components.

The use of model-based propensity scores as matching tools opens the way to the indirect estimation of mode-related measurement effects and selection effects in web surveys, including a component of selection that cannot be traced back to observable characteristics. By matching and comparing respondents from real independent surveys that use the same questionnaire, but different administration modes, it becomes possible to isolate the selection effect induced by unobservable (or unobserved) respondent characteristics. This study applies a stratification matching algorithm to compare a web survey from a proprietary panel with a computer-assisted telephone survey based on random digit-dialing. The experiment is run in two countries (UK and Italy) to check for consistencies across different cultures and different internet penetration rates. The application to the elicitation of support for healthy eating policies indicates large and significant measurement and selection effects. After controlling for differences in the observed characteristics of respondents and the intensity of internet use, findings suggest that web surveys record lower support and higher neutrality. Similarly, after controlling for administration mode and observed respondent characteristics, internet users are less likely to state support compared to non-users. This suggests that unobserved characteristics play a major role, and post-stratification weighting is not a sufficient countermeasure. As demonstrated by the cross-country comparison, rising internet penetration rates are not a guarantee against this type of error, as disparities in these unobserved characteristics are likely to increase at the same time.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196020</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523986744698</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5d0bdfdb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Capacci, Mario Mazzocchi, Sergio Brasini&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Weekends off antiretroviral therapy (ART) may help engage HIV-1-infected young people facing lifelong treatment. BREATHER showed short cycle therapy (SCT; 5 days on, 2 days off ART) was non-inferior to continuous therapy (CT) over 48 weeks. Planned follow-up was extended to 144 weeks, maintaining original randomisation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;BREATHER was an open-label, non-inferiority trial. Participants aged 8-24yrs with virological suppression on efavirenz-based first-line ART were randomised 1:1, stratified by age and African/non-African sites, to remain on CT or change to SCT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the proportion of participants with viral rebound (confirmed VL≥50 copies/mL) under intent-to-treat at 48 weeks (primary outcome), and in extended follow-up at 96, 144, and 192 weeks. SCT participants returned to CT following viral rebound, 3 VL blips or discontinuation of efavirenz.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of 199 participants (99 SCT, 100 CT), 97 per arm consented to extended follow-up. Median follow-up was 185.3 weeks (IQR 160.9–216.1). 69 (70%) SCT participants remained on SCT at last follow-up. 105 (53%) were male, baseline median age 14 years (IQR 12–18), median CD4 count 735 cells/μL (IQR 576–968). 16 SCT and 16 CT participants had confirmed VL≥50 copies/mL by the end of extended follow-up (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50–2.00). Estimated difference in percentage with viral rebound (SCT minus CT) by week 144 was 1.9% (90% CI -6.6–10.4; p = 0.72) and was similar in a per-protocol analysis. There were no significant differences between arms in proportions of participants with grade 3/4 adverse events (18 SCT vs 16 CT participants; p = 0.71) or ART-related adverse events (10 vs 12; p = 0.82). 20 versus 8 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 16 SCT versus 4 CT participants, respectively (p = 0.005 comparing proportions between groups; incidence rate ratio 2.49, 95%CI 0.71–8.66, p = 0.15). 75% of SAEs (15 SCT, 6 CT) were hospitalisations for a wide range of conditions. 3 SCT and 6 CT participants switched to second-line ART following viral failure (p = 0.50).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sustainable non-inferiority of virological suppression in young people was shown for SCT versus CT over median 3.6 years. Standard-dose efavirenz-based SCT is a viable option for virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected young people on first-line ART with 3-monthly VL monitoring.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;EudraCT 2009-012947-40ISRCTN 97755073ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01641016&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196239</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5cb0b82e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Turkova, Cecilia L.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Variations in the degree of hirsutism among women of different ethnic backgrounds may stem from multiple etiologies. Shorter length of the polymorphic CAG repeats of the &lt;i&gt;androgen receptor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt;) gene may be associated with increased activity of the receptor leading to hirsutism. We hypothesized that there are ethnic differences in the degree of hirsutism that is unrelated to androgen levels among Israeli women, and that the CAG repeats length may contribute to these differences. Anti-androgenic therapies, such as spironolactone, could be suggested if a shorter CAG repeats length is found to affect the difference in the degree of hirsutism between the ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Healthy Israeli Jewish women aged 18–45 years of Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi origin were invited to participate. Hirsutism was assessed using the simplified Ferriman–Gallwey (sFG) score, and serum total testosterone levels were measured as well. The CAG repeats length was determined by PCR. Methylation-sensitive methods were used to detect the fractional activity of each allele, and the weighted mean was calculated for the CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and eight women were recruited (49 Ashkenazi and 59 non-Ashkenazi). The Ashkenazi women had a significantly lower degree of hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), lower mean BMI (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), total testosterone levels (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017), and longer weighted bi-allelic CAG repeats mean (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015) compared to non-Ashkenazi women. For the group as a whole, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of CAG repeats in the &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; gene and the sFG score, while the number of repeats was not related to testosterone levels. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that ethnic origin and the CAG repeats length were the strongest factors affecting hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a significant difference in the degree of hirsutism between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi women in Israel that is partially explained by CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195046</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>17eb6b10</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naomi Weintrob, Ori Eyal, Meital Slakman, Anat Segev Becker, Galit Israeli, Ofra Kalter-Leibovici, Shay Ben-Shachar&lt;/p&gt;

The ecology of Lyme borreliosis is complex in northwestern California, with several potential reservoir hosts, tick vectors, and genospecies of &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato. The primary objective of this study was to determine the fine-scale spatial distribution of different genospecies in four rodent species, the California ground squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Otospermophilus beecheyi&lt;/i&gt;), northern flying squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Glaucomys sabrinus&lt;/i&gt;), dusky-footed woodrat (&lt;i&gt;Neotoma fuscipes&lt;/i&gt;), and Allen’s chipmunk (&lt;i&gt;Neotamias senex&lt;/i&gt;). Rodents were live-trapped between June 2004 and May 2005 at the Hoopa Valley Tribal Reservation (HVTR) in Humboldt County, California. Ear-punch biopsies obtained from each rodent were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. The programs ArcGIS and SaTScan were used to examine the spatial distribution of genospecies. Multinomial log-linear models were used to model habitat and host-specific characteristics and their effect on the presence of each borrelial genospecies. The Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to compare models and determine model fit. &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was primarily associated with chipmunks and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; largely with woodrats. The top model included the variables “host species”, “month”, and “elevation” (weight = 0.84). Spatial clustering of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; was detected in the northwestern section of the HVTR, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was clustered in the southeastern section. We conclude that the spatial distribution of these borreliae are driven at least in part by host species, time-of-year, and elevation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195586</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>968b65e3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gregory M.

Spatial clustering of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; was detected in the northwestern section of the HVTR, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was clustered in the southeastern section. We conclude that the spatial distribution of these borreliae are driven at least in part by host species, time-of-year, and elevation.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195586</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Gregory M.

Users can also visualise and analyse their own data via the web portal. The interactive visualisation implemented in the web portal can facilitate characterising schistosome genes for the research community.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308213v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Lu, Z.</name></author><title>A web portal for gene expression across all life stages of Schistosoma mansoni [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162fe2afbd2:65a51d:9f3b30f2</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308213v1?rss=1</link><published>1524639600000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003782</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cong-Hui Yao, Gao-Yuan Liu, Rencheng Wang, Sung Ho Moon, Richard W.

It has been suggested that some cancer cells rely upon fatty acid oxidation (FAO) for energy. Here we show that when FAO was reduced approximately 90% by pharmacological inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) with low concentrations of etomoxir, the proliferation rate of various cancer cells was unaffected. Efforts to pharmacologically inhibit FAO more than 90% revealed that high concentrations of etomoxir (200 μM) have an off-target effect of inhibiting complex I of the electron transport chain. Surprisingly, however, when FAO was reduced further by genetic knockdown of &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt;, the proliferation rate of these same cells decreased nearly 2-fold and could not be restored by acetate or octanoic acid supplementation. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns had altered mitochondrial morphology and impaired mitochondrial coupling, whereas cells in which CPT1 had been approximately 90% inhibited by etomoxir did not. Lipidomic profiling of mitochondria isolated from &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns showed depleted concentrations of complex structural and signaling lipids. Additionally, expression of a catalytically dead &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns did not restore mitochondrial coupling. Taken together, these results suggest that transport of at least some long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria by CPT1 may be required for anabolic processes that support healthy mitochondrial function and cancer cell proliferation independent of FAO.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xb9CFXhgCsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cong-Hui Yao, Gao-Yuan Liu, Rencheng Wang, Sung Ho Moon, Richard W.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite decades of efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in the United States (US), TB still contributes to adverse ill health, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2016, about 87% of the TB cases reported in the US were among racial and ethnic minorities. The objective of this study is to explore the risks for pregnancy complications and in-hospital death among mothers diagnosed with TB across racial/ethnic groups in the US.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized National Inpatient Sample data for all inpatient hospital discharges in the US. We analyzed pregnancy-related hospitalizations and births in the US from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2014 (n = 57,393,459). Multivariable logistic regression was applied to generate odds ratios for the association between TB status and the primary study outcomes (i.e., pregnancy complications and in-hospital death) across racial/ethnic categories.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of TB was 7.1 per 100,000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations. The overall prevalence of pregnancy complications was 80% greater among TB-infected mothers than their uninfected counterparts. Severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, placenta previa, post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis and anemia occurred with greater frequency among mothers with a TB diagnosis than those without TB, irrespective of race/ethnicity. The rate of in-hospital death among TB patients was 37 times greater among TB-infected than in non-TB infected mothers (468.8 per 100,000 versus 12.6 per 100,000). A 3-fold increased risk of in-hospital death was observed among black TB-negative mothers compared to their white counterparts. No racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity or in-hospital death were found among mothers with TB disease.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TB continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in the US. Resources to address TB disease should also target pregnant women, especially racial/ethnic minorities who bear the greatest burden of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194836</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>40657a59</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erika M.

A widespread opinion is that conservation efforts disproportionately benefit charismatic species. However, this doesn’t mean that they are not threatened, and which species are “charismatic” remains unclear. Here, we identify the 10 most charismatic animals and show that they are at high risk of imminent extinction in the wild. We also find that the public ignores these animals’ predicament and we suggest it could be due to the observed biased perception of their abundance, based more on their profusion in our culture than on their natural populations. We hypothesize that this biased perception impairs conservation efforts because people are unaware that the animals they cherish face imminent extinction and do not perceive their urgent need for conservation. By freely using the image of rare and threatened species in their product marketing, many companies may participate in creating this biased perception, with unintended detrimental effects on conservation efforts, which should be compensated by channeling part of the associated profits to conservation. According to our hypothesis, this biased perception would be likely to last as long as the massive cultural and commercial presence of charismatic species is not accompanied by adequate information campaigns about the imminent threats they face.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Nro8ydzQjr8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Franck Courchamp, Ivan Jaric, Céline Albert, Yves Meinard, William J.

Integrating the resulting cell type census with a physiological and anatomical taxonomy has been difficult, as most techniques require the tissue to be dissociated before sequencing.

Commercial hunting for the international trade in animal hides in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century decimated many populations of aquatic wildlife in Amazonia. However, impacts varied significantly between different species and regions, depending upon hunting intensity, accessibility of habitat, and the inherent resilience of various species and their habitats. We investigated the differential responses of two Amazonian Mustelid species, the neotropical otter and giant otter, to commercial hunting pressure along the upper Rio Negro in Brazil, and examined historical factors that influenced spatial and temporal variation in commercial exploitation. We analyzed previously unanalyzed data from historical records of hide shipments to track changes in hide sales and prices for the two species in the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. We also gathered oral histories from older Baniwa people who had witnessed or participated in commercial otter hunting. These complimentary data sources reveal how intrinsic biological and social characteristics of the two otter species interacted with market forces and regional history. Whereas giant otter populations were driven to local or regional extinction during the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century by commercial hunting, neotropical otters persisted. In recent decades, giant otter populations have returned to some parts of the upper Rio Negro, a development which local people welcome as part of a generalized recovery of the ecosystems in their territory as a result of the banning of animal pelt exports and indigenous land demarcation.

Human protection policies require favorable risk–benefit judgments prior to launch of clinical trials. For phase I and II trials, evidence for such judgment often stems from preclinical efficacy studies (PCESs). We undertook a systematic investigation of application materials (investigator brochures [IBs]) presented for ethics review for phase I and II trials to assess the content and properties of PCESs contained in them. Using a sample of 109 IBs most recently approved at 3 institutional review boards based at German Medical Faculties between the years 2010–2016, we identified 708 unique PCESs. We then rated all identified PCESs for their reporting on study elements that help to address validity threats, whether they referenced published reports, and the direction of their results. Altogether, the 109 IBs reported on 708 PCESs. Less than 5% of all PCESs described elements essential for reducing validity threats such as randomization, sample size calculation, and blinded outcome assessment. For most PCESs (89%), no reference to a published report was provided. Only 6% of all PCESs reported an outcome demonstrating no effect. For the majority of IBs (82%), all PCESs were described as reporting positive findings. Our results show that most IBs for phase I/II studies did not allow evaluators to systematically appraise the strength of the supporting preclinical findings. The very rare reporting of PCESs that demonstrated no effect raises concerns about potential design or reporting biases. Poor PCES design and reporting thwart risk–benefit evaluation during ethical review of phase I/II studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lvi8iDwsCE0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Wieschowski, William Wei Lim Chin, Carole Federico, Sören Sievers, Jonathan Kimmelman, Daniel Strech&lt;/p&gt;

The present study deciphers key elements for the &apos;hyper-helicase&apos; behavior of a mutant, and provides an effective framework to characterize directly structure-function relationships in molecular machines.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25169?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522118410699</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5d8685ad</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25169?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>False</unread><published>1522118410699</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626553c1cb:6ce04:76251cdd</id><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25169?af=R</link><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/28?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/28.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>94c7b5db</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/28?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Rochman, C.

Many catabolic stimuli, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM), promote cartilage breakdown via the induction of collagen-degrading collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;MMP1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; in human articular chondrocytes. Indeed, joint diseases with an inflammatory component are characterised by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism. Importantly, protein kinase C (PKC) signalling has a primary role in cytokine-induced &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt; expression, and is known to regulate cellular functions associated with pathologies involving ECM remodelling. At present, substrates downstream of PKC remain undefined. Herein, we show that both IL-1- and OSM-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) in human chondrocytes is strongly associated with signalling via the atypical PKCι isoform. Consequently, inhibiting PKD activation with a pan-PKD inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Specific gene silencing of the PKD isoforms revealed that only PKD3 (&lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt;) depletion mirrored the observed &lt;i&gt;MMP&lt;/i&gt; repression, indicative of the pharmacological inhibitor specifically affecting only this isoform. &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing was also shown to reduce serine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as phosphorylation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinase groups. This altered signalling following &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing led to a significant reduction in the expression of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) genes &lt;i&gt;FOS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt;, critical for the induction of many MMPs including &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the AP-1 factor activating transcription factor 3 (&lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt;) was also reduced concomitant with the observed reduction in &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; expression.

We investigated the impacts of the Mount Polley tailings impoundment failure on chemical, physical, and microbial properties of substrates within the affected watershed, comprised of 70 hectares of riparian wetlands and 40 km of stream and lake shore. We established a biomonitoring network in October of 2014, two months following the disturbance, and evaluated riparian and wetland substrates for microbial community composition and function via 16S and full metagenome sequencing. A total of 234 samples were collected from substrates at 3 depths and 1,650,752 sequences were recorded in a geodatabase framework. These data revealed a wealth of information regarding watershed-scale distribution of microbial community members, as well as community composition, structure, and response to disturbance. Substrates associated with the impact zone were distinct chemically as indicated by elevated pH, nitrate, and sulphate. The microbial community exhibited elevated metabolic capacity for selenate and sulfate reduction and an abundance of chemolithoautotrophs in the &lt;i&gt;Thiobacillus thiophilus/T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;denitrificans/T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thioparus&lt;/i&gt; clade that may contribute to nitrate attenuation within the affected watershed. The most impacted area (a 6 km stream connecting two lakes) exhibited 30% lower microbial diversity relative to the remaining sites. The tailings impoundment failure at Mount Polley Mine has provided a unique opportunity to evaluate functional and compositional diversity soon after a major catastrophic disturbance to assess metabolic potential for ecosystem recovery.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196032</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>40cd0e72</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Heath W.

Mechanical ventilation is an important tool for supporting critically ill patients but may also exert pathological forces on lung cells leading to Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). We hypothesised that inhibition of the force-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV4) ion channel may attenuate the negative effects of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical stretch increased intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung epithelial cells that was partially blocked by about 30% with the selective TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874, but nearly completely blocked with the pan-calcium channel blocker ruthenium red, suggesting the involvement of more than one calcium channel in the response to mechanical stress. Mechanical stretch also induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages, but in contrast this was entirely dependent upon TRPV4. In a murine ventilation model, TRPV4 inhibition attenuated both pulmonary barrier permeability increase and pro-inflammatory cytokines release due to high tidal volume ventilation. Taken together, these data suggest TRPV4 inhibitors may have utility as a prophylactic pharmacological treatment to improve the negative pathological stretch-response of lung cells during ventilation and potentially support patients receiving mechanical ventilation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196055</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523986744698</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>425da426</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by N.

Background &lt;p&gt;The ageing population and the expected increase in the number of elderly patients make an evidence-based assessment of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in old patients progressively more important. Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged &amp;lt;65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P&amp;lt;0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score.

PRESTO is intuitively integrated into an interactive user interface that helps to visualize the multi-dimensional patterns in genome-wide transcriptomic data from basic science and clinical studies. Results: PRESTO was tested with multiple input omics&apos; platforms, including microarray and proteomics from both mouse and human clinical datasets. PRESTO can analyze up to tens of thousands of genes and shows no increase in processing time with a large number of samples or patients. In complex datasets, such as those with multiple time points, several patient groups, or diverse mouse strains, PRESTO outperformed conventional methods. Core co-expressed gene networks were intuitively grouped in clusters, or gates, after dimensionality reduction and remained consistent across users. Networks were identified and assigned to physiological and pathological functions that cannot be gleaned from conventional bioinformatics analyses. PRESTO detected gene networks from the natural variations among mouse macrophages and human blood leukocytes. We applied PRESTO to clinical transcriptomic and proteomic data from large patient cohorts and detected disease-defining signatures in antibody-mediated kidney transplant rejection, renal cell carcinoma, and relapsing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In AML, PRESTO confirmed a previously described gene signature and found a new signature of 10 genes that is highly predictive of patient outcome. Conclusions: PRESTO offers an important integration of powerful bioinformatics tools with an interactive user interface that increases data analysis accessibility beyond bioinformaticians and &apos;coders&apos;. Here, we show that PRESTO out performs conventional methods, such as DE analysis, in multi-dimensional datasets and can identify biologically relevant co-expression gene networks.

Background &lt;p&gt;The molecular characterization of endometrial cancer (EC) can facilitate identification of various tumor subtypes. Although EC patients with &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations reproducibly demonstrate better prognosis, the outcome of patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) remains controversial. This study attempted to interrogate whether genetic stratification of EC can identify distinct subsets with prognostic significance.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A cohort of 138 EC patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent was enrolled. Sanger sequencing was used to evaluate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; genes. MSI analysis was performed using four mononucleotide repeat markers and methylation status of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was measured by a fluorescent bisulfite polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Protein expression for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Extensive hypermethylation of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was observed in 69.6% ECs with MLH1 deficiency and 3.5% with MMR proficiency, but in none of the ECs with loss of other MMR genes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .0001). MSI-positive and &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations were found in 29.0% and 8.7% EC patients, respectively. Our MSI analysis showed a sensitivity of 92.7% for EC patients with MMR deficiency, and a specificity of 97.9% for EC patients with MMR proficiency. In univariate and multivariate analyses, &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations and &lt;i&gt;MSI&lt;/i&gt; status was significantly associated with progression-free survival (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0129 and 0.0064, respectively) but not with endometrial cancer-specific survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study provides significant evidence that analyses of proofreading &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations and MSI status based on mononucleotide repeat markers are potentially useful biomarkers to identify EC patients with better prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195655</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>59e4e37f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoko Haruma, Takeshi Nagasaka, Keiichiro Nakamura, Junko Haraga, Akihiro Nyuya, Takeshi Nishida, Ajay Goel, Hisashi Masuyama, Yuji Hiramatsu&lt;/p&gt;

Nitrogen stress is an important control on the growth of phytoplankton and varying responses to this common condition among taxa may affect their relative success within phytoplankton communities. We analyzed photosynthetic responses to nitrogen (N) stress in two classes of phytoplankton that often dominate their respective size ranges, diatoms and prasinophytes, selecting species of distinct niches within each class. Changes in photosynthetic structures appeared similar within each class during N stress, but photophysiological and growth responses were more species- or niche-specific. In the coastal diatom &lt;i&gt;Thalassiosira pseudonana&lt;/i&gt; and the oceanic diatom &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;weissflogii&lt;/i&gt;, N starvation induced large declines in photosynthetic pigments and Photosystem II (PSII) quantity and activity as well as increases in the effective absorption cross-section of PSII photochemistry (&lt;i&gt;σʹ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;PSII&lt;/sub&gt;). These diatoms also increased photoprotection through energy-dependent non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) during N starvation. Resupply of N in diatoms caused rapid recovery of growth and relaxation of NPQ, while recovery of PSII photochemistry was slower. In contrast, the prasinophytes &lt;i&gt;Micromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp., an Arctic Ocean species, and &lt;i&gt;Ostreococcus tauri&lt;/i&gt;, a temperate coastal eutrophile, showed little change in photosynthetic pigments and structures and a decline or no change, respectively, in &lt;i&gt;σʹ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;PSII&lt;/sub&gt; with N starvation. Growth and PSII function recovered quickly in &lt;i&gt;Micromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. after resupply of N while &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tauri&lt;/i&gt; failed to recover N-replete levels of electron transfer from PSII and growth, possibly due to their distinct photoprotective strategies. &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tauri&lt;/i&gt; induced energy-dependent NPQ for photoprotection that may suit its variable and nutrient-rich habitat. &lt;i&gt;Micromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. relies upon both energy-dependent NPQ and a sustained, energy-independent NPQ mechanism.

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195544</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2467dea2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

Fungal communities in agricultural soils are assumed to be affected by soil and crop management. Our intention was to investigate the impact of different tillage and fertilization practices on fungal communities in a long-term crop rotation field trial established in 1992 in Central Germany. Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. conservation tillage, intensive &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (&lt;i&gt;Basidio&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Asco&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Zygo&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Glomero&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/i&gt;), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop.

Fungal communities in agricultural soils are assumed to be affected by soil and crop management. Our intention was to investigate the impact of different tillage and fertilization practices on fungal communities in a long-term crop rotation field trial established in 1992 in Central Germany. Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. conservation tillage, intensive &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (&lt;i&gt;Basidio&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Asco&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Zygo&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Glomero&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/i&gt;), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) substantiated the results and proved significant influences of tillage and pre-crop, while fertilization had the smallest and non-significant effect. In-depth analysis of putative phytopathogenic and plant beneficial fungal groups indicated distinct responses; for example &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; was significantly enriched in the intensively fertilized conservation tillage variants with the pre-crop maize, while &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt; displayed significant association with conventional tillage and pre-crop rapeseed.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co- and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested.

The spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity pose a great challenge to accurately estimate the carbon flux in global carbon cycling, which has primarily been researched in flatlands versus hillslope ecosystems. On an eroded slope (35°) of the semiarid Loess Plateau, soil respiration, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; at upper and lower slope positions in triplicate from 2014 until 2016, and the soil biochemical and microbial properties were determined. The results showed that soil respiration was significantly greater (by 44.2%) at the lower slope position (2.6 μmol m&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;) than at the upper slope position, as were soil moisture, carbon, nitrogen fractions and root biomass. However, the temperature sensitivity was 13.2% greater at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The soil fungal community changed from being Basidiomycota-dominant at the upper slope position to being Zygomycota-dominant at the lower slope position, corresponding with increased β-D-glucosidase activity at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position. We concluded that soil respiration was enhanced by the greater soil moisture, root biomass, carbon and nitrogen contents at the lower slope position than at the upper slope position. Moreover, the increased soil respiration and decreased temperature sensitivity at the lower slope position were partially due to copiotrophs replacing oligotrophs. Such spatial variations along slopes must be properly accounted for when estimating the carbon budget and feedback of future climate change on hillslope ecosystems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>767ae66b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qiqi Sun, Rui Wang, Yaxian Hu, Lunguang Yao, Shengli Guo&lt;/p&gt;

The waste of commonly used medicines is known to contaminate freshwater ecosystems. Pharmaceuticals can be toxic, mutagenic, or modifying to freshwater organisms even at low concentrations if consider their permanent presence in the environment. Chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer, and in particular alkylating agents, contribute significantly to this form of pollution, the latter introducing cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to the DNA and RNA of organisms which can be disruptive to their cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide (CP) on &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt; clones. We evaluated the life history parameters and protein profiles of this crustacean following exposure to environmentally relevant CP concentration of 10 ng L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Even at this low concentration, the alkylating agent caused modification of the life history parameters and proteome profile of the &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt;. These changes were clone-specific and involved growth rate, age at first reproduction, neonate number, and proteins related to cell cycle and redox state regulation. The disturbance caused by pharmaceuticals contaminating freshwater ecosystem is probably weaker and unlikely to be cytotoxic in character due to the high dilution of these substances in the water. However, our results indicate that prolonged exposure of organisms to these toxins may lead to modifications on the organismal and molecular levels with unpredictable significance for the entire ecosystem.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195366</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d431fe05</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to evaluate in the Wistar rat the efficacy of various autologous nerve conduits with various forms of blood supply in reconstructing a 10-mm-long gap in the median nerve (MN) under conditions of local ischemia. A 10-mm-long median nerve defect was created in the right arm. A loose silicone tube was placed around the nerve gap zone, in order to simulate a local ischemic environment. Rats were divided in the following experimental groups (each with 20 rats): the nerve Graft (NG) group, in which the excised MN segment was reattached; the conventional nerve flap (CNF) and the arterialized neurovenous flap (ANVF) groups in which the gap was bridged with homonymous median nerve flaps; the prefabricated nerve flap (PNF) group in which the gap was reconstructed with a fabricated flap created by leaving an arteriovenous fistula in contact with the sciatic nerve for 5 weeks; and the two control groups, Sham and Excision groups. In the latter group, the proximal stump of the MN nerve was ligated and no repair was performed. The rats were followed for 100 days. During this time, they did physiotherapy. Functional, electroneuromyographic and histological studies were performed. The CNF and ANVF groups presented better results than the NG group in the following assessments: grasping test, nociception, motor stimulation threshold, muscle weight, and histomorphometric evaluation. Radial deviation of the operated forepaw was more common in rats that presented worse results in the other outcome variables. Overall, CNFs and ANVFs produced a faster and more complete recovery than NGs in the reconstruction of a 10-mm-long median nerve gap in an ischemic environment in the Wistar rat. Although, results obtained with CNFs were in most cases were better than ANVFs, these differences were not statistically significant for most of the outcome variables.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>17b4cadf</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diogo Casal, Eduarda Mota-Silva, Inês Iria, Sara Alves, Ana Farinho, Cláudia Pen, Nuno Lourenço-Silva, Luís Mascarenhas-Lemos, José Silva-Ferreira, Mário Ferraz-Oliveira, Valentina Vassilenko, Paula Alexandra Videira, João Goyri-O’Neill, Diogo Pais&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The comparison between long acting insulin analogues (LAIA) and human insulin (NPH) has been investigated for decades, with many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews giving mixed results. This overlapping and contradictory evidence has increased uncertainty on coverage decisions at health systems level.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To conduct an overview of systematic reviews and update existing reviews, preparing new meta-analysis to determine whether LAIA are effective for T1D patients compared to NPH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified systematic reviews of RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of LAIA glargine or detemir, compared to NPH insulin for T1D, assessing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and hypoglycemia. Data sources included Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and hand-searching. The methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by two reviewers, using AMSTAR and Jadad scale.

Background &lt;p&gt;The comparison between long acting insulin analogues (LAIA) and human insulin (NPH) has been investigated for decades, with many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews giving mixed results. This overlapping and contradictory evidence has increased uncertainty on coverage decisions at health systems level.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To conduct an overview of systematic reviews and update existing reviews, preparing new meta-analysis to determine whether LAIA are effective for T1D patients compared to NPH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified systematic reviews of RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of LAIA glargine or detemir, compared to NPH insulin for T1D, assessing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and hypoglycemia. Data sources included Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and hand-searching. The methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by two reviewers, using AMSTAR and Jadad scale. We found 11 eligible systematic reviews that contained a total of 25 relevant clinical trials. Two reviewers independently abstracted data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found evidence that LAIA are efficacious compared to NPH, with estimates showing a reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia episodes (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.57; 0.76) and A1C (95% CI 0.23; 0.12). No significance was found related to severe hypoglycemia (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.71; 1.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study design has allowed us to carry out the most comprehensive assessment of RCTs on this subject, filling a gap in diabetes research.

If a density functional theory (DFT) method is able to yield accurate dipole moments, it should first provide an accurate geometry and then predict a reliable charge distribution for that geometry. In this respect, recent literatures have revealed that most DFT approximations work considerably better for single‐reference molecules with respect to multi‐reference ones, as may be expected from this fact that DFT utilizes a single configuration state function as reference function to represent the density. Putting together, it seems that as compared to the single‐reference systems, situation is slightly more involved in the case of dipole moment calculations of multi‐reference molecules. Effort to address this latter issue constitutes the cornerstone of the present investigation. To this end, we rely on a different approach where the new optimally (nonempirically) tuned range‐separated hybrid density functionals (OT‐RSHs) without invoking any empirical fitting are proposed for predicting the dipole moments of multi‐reference molecules containing both main‐group elements and transition metals. We have scanned the controlling factors of OT‐RSHs like short‐ and long‐range exchange contributions and range‐separation parameter with the aim of deriving the best performing models for the purpose. The obtained results unveil that, as compared to the standard range‐separated density functionals, our newly developed OT‐RSHs not only give an improved description on the dipole moments of the molecules with multi‐reference character but also the quality of their predictions is better than other conventional and recently proposed DFT approximations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25221?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>MojtabaAlipour</name></author><title>Dipole moments of molecules with multi‐reference character from optimally tuned range‐separated density functional theory</title><unread>True</unread><published>1523356985000</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162cf83c33e:2b0824a:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25221?af=R</link><summary><content>Dipole moment is the first nonzero moment of the charge density of neutral systems.

Putting together, it seems that as compared to the single‐reference systems, situation is slightly more involved in the case of dipole moment calculations of multi‐reference molecules. Effort to address this latter issue constitutes the cornerstone of the present investigation. To this end, we rely on a different approach where the new optimally (nonempirically) tuned range‐separated hybrid density functionals (OT‐RSHs) without invoking any empirical fitting are proposed for predicting the dipole moments of multi‐reference molecules containing both main‐group elements and transition metals. We have scanned the controlling factors of OT‐RSHs like short‐ and long‐range exchange contributions and range‐separation parameter with the aim of deriving the best performing models for the purpose. The obtained results unveil that, as compared to the standard range‐separated density functionals, our newly developed OT‐RSHs not only give an improved description on the dipole moments of the molecules with multi‐reference character but also the quality of their predictions is better than other conventional and recently proposed DFT approximations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195558</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Del’Guidice, Jean-Pascal Lepetit-Stoffaes, Louis-Jean Bordeleau, Joannie Roberge, Vanessa Théberge, Coraline Lauvaux, Xavier Barbeau, Jessica Trottier, Vibhuti Dave, Denis-Claude Roy, Bruno Gaillet, Alain Garnier, David Guay&lt;/p&gt;
Delivery of recombinant proteins to therapeutic cells is limited by a lack of efficient methods. This hinders the use of transcription factors or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) ribonucleoproteins to develop cell therapies. Here, we report a soluble peptide designed for the direct delivery of proteins to mammalian cells including human stem cells, hard-to-modify primary natural killer (NK) cells, and cancer cell models. This peptide is composed of a 6x histidine-rich domain fused to the endosomolytic peptide CM18 and the cell penetrating peptide PTD4. A less than two-minute co-incubation of 6His-CM18-PTD4 peptide with spCas9 and/or asCpf1 CRISPR ribonucleoproteins achieves robust gene editing. The same procedure, co-incubating with the transcription factor HoxB4, achieves transcriptional regulation.

Outbreaks of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been reported in poultry species in the United States since 2014. These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2–4 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>260bbdf1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyesun Jang, Mohamed Elaish, Mahesh KC, Michael C.

Background &lt;p&gt;The survival rate of childhood cancer patients increased over the past decades. However, even after successful treatment the transition back to normalcy is often a major challenge for the whole family. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families in the first years after the end of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA Checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059782). In November 2016 and September 2017, we searched the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science. We included studies investigating psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors diagnosed under the age of 21, their family members or the family as a whole. Further, we summarized the study characteristics and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results. Finally, we assessed the study quality with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 8215 records based on our database searches and 17 additional records through hand searches. We included 33 articles in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies described interventions for the cancer survivor (n = 15). Nine studies investigated interventions for the whole family, and two studies interventions for siblings. The interventions mainly take place in an outpatient group setting (n = 15). Overall, most of the studies reported a significant psychosocial benefit of the interventions. However, the quality of the included studies was limited.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In summary, we identified a broad range of different interventions and thus could give a comprehensive overview of existing interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families. However, there is a necessity for high quality studies. The results may help to optimize health care services that support families with the re-entry into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196151</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>44fd683a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mona Leandra Peikert, Laura Inhestern, Corinna Bergelt&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families in the first years after the end of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA Checklist (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059782). In November 2016 and September 2017, we searched the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and Web of Science. We included studies investigating psychosocial interventions for childhood cancer survivors diagnosed under the age of 21, their family members or the family as a whole. Further, we summarized the study characteristics and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results. Finally, we assessed the study quality with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 8215 records based on our database searches and 17 additional records through hand searches. We included 33 articles in the qualitative synthesis. Most of the studies described interventions for the cancer survivor (n = 15). Nine studies investigated interventions for the whole family, and two studies interventions for siblings. The interventions mainly take place in an outpatient group setting (n = 15). Overall, most of the studies reported a significant psychosocial benefit of the interventions. However, the quality of the included studies was limited.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In summary, we identified a broad range of different interventions and thus could give a comprehensive overview of existing interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families. However, there is a necessity for high quality studies. The results may help to optimize health care services that support families with the re-entry into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196151</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Mona Leandra Peikert</name></author><title>Psychosocial interventions for rehabilitation and reintegration into daily life of pediatric cancer survivors and their families: A systematic review</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524171600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f78fe:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196151</link><published>1524171600000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/134?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/134.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a63d1b7f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/134?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><title>News at a glance</title><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Scientific Community</item></keywords><engagement>0</engagement><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:feceb2:34f43e70</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/134?rss=1</link><published>1523554635000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/eaao7283?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Structurally and genetically, human herpesviruses are among the largest and most complex of viruses.

I can state as a fact that the first time I heard a joking reference to his attitude towards traditional synthetic organic chemistry was in the summer of 1983, so it’s not like he’s been keeping his thoughts bottled up. But this is certainly a good summary of them, and here’s the key question that’s being asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The ability to put together molecules – bit‐by‐bit, simple or complex – is one of chemistry’s great accomplishments, and a source of amazement to those in many other fields of science. More than one physicist has told me that s/he cannot believe that it is possible to manipulate bonds between individual atoms with the skill that organic chemists do. When I look at a complex structure assembled in a beautifully organized campaign, I also am amazed. That said, all fields of science morph with time. The phrase “organic synthesis” has come to mean “synthesis of structurally complex natural products”, or, perhaps, “synthesis of complicated molecules with pharmaceutical activity.” Nature, and relevance to healthcare, define the targets, and provide the utilitarian justification for the effort. Is there (or should there be) more to it than that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidiary questions are whether organic synthesis of that sort is worth the effort that’s being put into it and whether it trains students to do useful things and whether other types of work could do a better job of that. In order to address these, Whitesides notes, we have to make sure that we’re talking about the same things. He defines “organic synthesis” (small letters) as any sort of putting-together-of-organic molecules, and “Organic Synthesis” (with the capitals) as the sort of complex and often natural-product-based synthesis practiced by R. B. Woodward, his contemporaries, and his intellectual heirs. The latter is what many people mean by those two words, to be sure, and Whitesides has some questions about just what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the field a science that generates new concepts and new theory? Is it instead more of an art form, driven at least partly by aesthetic choices (that can be appreciated by skilled observers) rather than utility &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;? Or is it something of a craft, achieving its results (in the end) through skilled empirical tinkering? These questions, especially in the way that they’re phrased, are likely to cause intense annoyance in some practitioners. But I think that the annoyance is a sign that these categories are uncomfortably plausible and recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the field partakes of all of these characteristics, but on what proportions? I think that the science/craft distinction is actually one question, and that these are on the same scale with opposite signs: the more solid the theoretical framework, the less Edisonian tinkering. My opinion is toward the Edisonian end. Organic synthesis is not bereft of theories and organizing concepts, but they do not operate strongly enough (that is, in a detailed enough fashion) to allow us to predict (for example) reaction conditions. That’s why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. The same goes for predicting new reactions, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/11/24/reaction_discovery_reviewed&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. No one sat down a few decades ago and said “Y’know, my knowledge of organometallic chemistry allows me to predict that palladium, in particular, will show oxidative addition/reductive elimination behavior that will be spectacularly useful in carbon-carbon bond formation. And while I’m making bold predictions, you might try aryl boronic acids for that reaction first, even though hardly any such things have even been described”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for art, I would very much like to have a dollar for every total-synthesis person who has talked about the field in terms of its artistic qualities. We have Woodward to thank for this – the man was a &lt;em&gt;tremendous&lt;/em&gt; scientist, but his influence has &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/22/woodwards-prose-style&quot;&gt;not always been&lt;/a&gt; for the good. I don’t think nearly as many people went into spasms about elegance and beauty in reference to total synthesis before him, and what’s more annoying is that those are valid concepts to apply even if Woodward sometimes came across like an Aubrey Beardsley aesthete about them. My own view is that we should let the artistic qualities of organic synthesis, which exist, speak for themselves. Because if they can’t, no amount of &lt;em&gt;raffiniert&lt;/em&gt; gushing about them will substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitesides isn’t through. That three-parter is just his first of three questions! The second one is a two-parter: is organic synthesis best thought of as an enabling technology to do things (such as make drugs, etc.) or as a framework that lets us ask questions about the nature of molecules and their behavior? That is, are the uses to which we put this field, and the justifications we give for it, best described as practical ones or intellectual ones? We tend to haul out the former first and start talking in better-living-through-(organic)-chemistry style, and that’s understandable. Compounds made through organic synthesis, and available through no other practical means, are crucial underpinnings of the modern world. If we’re not proud of that, what are we to be proud of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that second justification, while it sounds like more aesthetic hand-waving to the lay public (and to funding agencies), has some staying power. Ask the physicists, or even the mathematicians. Asking fundamental questions, and having the right framework in which to be able to ask them, can pay off hugely even from the practical end, intellectual satisfaction aside. There’s a lot of number theory that was just another ornament of mathematics until it became vital for modern cryptography and secure communications (G. H. Hardy would have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2IK9D0o&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;horrified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Relativity was a fantastic intellectual feat by Einstein, but relativistic corrections are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html&quot;&gt;needed&lt;/a&gt; to make the GPS system work correctly, among many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third question is, what should we teach chemistry students about the field? That is, what are the most important things for them to know? There’s a massive pile of empirical knowledge, famously dreaded by sophomores, but it’s taught (or should be!) according to general organizing principles – although those are the very ones that are not quite adequate enough to explain everything that’s going on. At what level should we teach this subject? You can say “Here are reactions that depend on alpha-carbonyl anions, and here’s why they happen”, you can say “Time to learn the difference between the Dieckmann and Claisen condensations”, or “Here are the kinds of products these reactions form and what they’re used for”, or “Here are some tips on how to run these things at the bench”, and on and on. What should be in the syllabus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own take on this is that there should definitely be a bias towards the general principles, which is what the better organic chemistry professors already do. Teaching the subject as a pile of reactions is a crime. I may be too loose about this stuff, but I would rather a student, if it came down to it, mess up a bit on the detailed mechanism of the Mitsunobu reaction if they understand that its driving force is the thermodynamic sink of triphenylphosphine oxide formation. The difference between the Dieckmann and the Claisen condensations is that the former is intramolecular and the latter is intermolecular, but I think it’s a waste of brain space to give them different names and memorize them as such. I would much rather that a student, in this case, immediately recognize the mechanism of an alpha-carbonyl anion attacking an ester carbonyl (no matter what the name associated with that process is) and recognize the influence of the leaving group of the ester, the stability vs. reactivity characteristics of the nucleophile, the likelihood of the various ring sizes being formed in the intramolecular reaction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nowhere near exhausted the Annoying Questions of George Whitesides, but this post is long enough as it is!

Cerium (Ce) belongs to the rare earth elements (REEs), and although it is not essential for plants, it can stimulate growth and other physiological processes. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of Ce on seed germination, initial seedling growth, and vegetative growth in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) cv. Morelos A-98. During the germination process, the seeds were treated with Ce concentrations of 0, 4, 8, and 12 μM; after 5 d, germination percentage was recorded and after 10 d seedling growth was measured. For vegetative growth, a hydroponic system was established where 14-d-old plants without previous Ce treatment were transferred into nutrient solution. After two weeks of acclimatizing, 0, 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce were added to the nutrient solution for 28 d. Ce significantly increased germination and the initial growth variables of the seedlings. During vegetative growth, Ce increased plant height, number of tillers, root volume, and shoot fresh and dry biomass, without affecting root biomass weight. With low Ce concentrations (25 and 50 μM), the concentrations of chlorophylls and amino acids in the shoots were similar to those in the control, like amino acid concentration in the roots at a concentration of 25 μM Ce. Conversely, the concentration of total sugars increased in the shoot with the application of 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce, and in the roots with the application of 50 μM Ce. Also, Ce did not affect the concentration of macro or micronutrients in the shoots. However, in the roots, the high Ce concentration decreased the concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn, while the Mg concentration increased. Our results indicate that Ce, at the right concentrations, can function as a biostimulant in rice germination and growth.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194691</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>97c046b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Monzerrat Ramírez-Olvera, Libia Iris Trejo-Téllez, Soledad García-Morales, Juan Antonio Pérez-Sato, Fernando Carlos Gómez-Merino&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have established a correlation between coronary artery calcification (CAC) measured by ECG-gated chest computed tomography (CT) and cardiovascular disease. Recent reports which included asymptomatic patients suggest that CAC measured on non-ECG gated CT is similarly associated with cardiovascular risk. This study investigates the correlation between the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and an incidental finding of CAC on a non-gated chest CT performed for non-cardiac indications in young and seemingly healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study that included 162 CT scans performed in young patients aged 18–50 years old for non-cardiac indications in our institution was conducted. CAC score (CACS) was calculated using the Agatston method. FRS was calculated and compared to the CACS using three different approaches. The correlations between the CACS and several specific factors (i.e. age, body mass index, smoking, statins, etc.), were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of patients was 36.43 year old and 105 (64.8%) were male. We found a significant positive correlation between the CACS and the FRS in all three approaches (p&amp;lt;0.05). Increased age, smoking and statin use were the only individual factors clearly associated with an increase in CACS (p = 0.002, p = 0.045 and p = 0.009, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This is the first report indicating that incidental CACS identified in non-gated MDCT is also associated with cardiovascular risk evaluated by FRS in a young population. Our findings suggest that young asymptomatic individuals with incidental CAC should be seriously evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors despite presumption of belonging to a low cardiovascular risk category.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195061</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>95b0b8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Lichtenstein, Amichai Perlman, Shoshana Shpitzen, Ronen Durst, Dorit Shaham, Eran Leitersdorf, Auryan Szalat&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity after acute coronary syndrome compared to patients without prior multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multicenter prospective cohort study in Switzerland included 5,635 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome between 2009 and 2014, with a one-year follow-up period. We defined cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity as having at least two prior comorbidities before the index hospitalization. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional models were built to assess the one-year risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. The final model was adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, tobacco consumption, education, and family history of cardiovascular disease, prescription of high-dose statinsat discharge and use of cardiac rehabilitation after discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 3,664 patients (65%) had no multimorbidity, 1,839 (33%) had cardiovascular multimorbidity, 62 (1%) had non-cardiovascular multimorbidity, and 70 (1%) had both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity. The multivariate risk of recurrent cardiovascular events was increased among patients with cardiovascular multimorbidity (hazard ratio (HR) 2.05, 95% CI: 1.54–2.73, p&amp;lt;0.001) and patients with non-cardiovascular multimorbidity (HR 2.57, 95% CI: 1.04–6.35, p = 0.04) compared to patients without multimorbidity. Patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity had the highest risk of recurrence with a HR of 5.19, 95% CI: 2.79–9.64, p&amp;lt;0.001, compared to patients without multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity increased by two-fold the risk of cardiovascular events over the year after an acute coronary syndrome.

So far I have yet to come across a drug discovery organization that really thinks that its compound libraries are what they should be – there are too many of those similar compounds from those similar projects that we used to be into back when, there are too many of those compounds that we purchased from vendors X and Y and Z, there are too many insoluble ones or decomposing ones or just plain boring ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s natural to think that the way to better screening results is to have a better compound collection – I mean, what could be more obvious? And it’s also obvious that every compound collection could always improve – it could be larger, or less greasy, or less streaked with legacy compounds that have too much baggage, etc. I don’t think it ever does harm to address these issues. The question is, how much good does it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask that question just because of the numbers involved. You have the numbers in your own collection, and you have the numbers in chemical space in general. The first is probably pretty large, and the second is larger than any human mind can deal with. Any one company’s compound collection – any one &lt;em&gt;planet’s&lt;/em&gt; compound collection – is a tiny mote in the sky of chemical space, even broadly druglike chemical space. So you’re not going to make much headway on the absolute scale, no matter how many diversity compounds you can get into vials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to the relative scale, then, you’re still going to have to make a pretty big effort to change your own collection’s character. This is why organizations have, over the years, tended to divide their collections into subfractions. Here are X thousand compounds to represent the deck as a whole – that’s something to use to try an assay out to troubleshoot it and get an idea of what the hit rate will be if you go on. Here’s the fraction of the deck that meets these particular biophysical criteria (and over here is the fraction of the deck that doesn’t). Here’s the fragment collection, here’s the more natural-product-like end of things, here’s the deliberately more three-dimensional set, and so on. In some (many?) companies, a classic screen-the-whole-deck situation has gotten more rare over the years, although there are always targets that need that and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up another consideration: sometimes you want more compounds because you’re not really getting any actionable hits in a screen (particularly against those tough targets). And sometimes you want more compounds because while you’re getting real hits, they’re not hits that you like. Maybe they’re from those legacy projects and the IP/selectivity considerations are too much of a hairball, or they’re coming out too nonpolar or with too few vectors for further optimization, what have you. You’d rather start somewhere else, and the deck doesn’t give you as many somewhere-elses as you’d want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the second category has a better chance of being fixed by adding swaths of new compounds – at least you know that the target is capable of binding small molecules. Now, it can always be the problem that the target just wants ugly chemical matter (CETP is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/06/29/the_cetp_rogues_gallery&quot;&gt;classic example&lt;/a&gt;), in which case there may not be much to do about it, but there will surely be other projects where something more workable presents itself. But the first category – just not getting hits – is a tougher situation. You can get stuck in an unprovable-hypothesis loop: if you didn’t get hits, you need more compounds. So you add more, and you didn’t get hits – well, you didn’t add enough, or the right ones. Who’s to say that the winner isn’t just over the horizon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a question that combichem was supposed to help answer back about twenty years ago or so, and it’s the question that its sequel, DNA-encoded library screening, is supposed to help answer now. From the beginning, the tricky part of the latter compounds sets has been the number of reactions compatible with the attached DNA barcodes. Combichem had that problem, too, in its early days: what price another ten thousand aryl amides? But (partly because of that grim experience) the DEL folks have been, right from the start, trying to expand their synthetic universe, and these efforts continue. My read so far on DEL screening is that it’s a very useful technique, but (as is always the case) not a magic bullet. People outside of drug discovery always seem to be amazed that we can screen a million compounds and not find something that binds to Target X, and they’d be even more amazed to know that you can run a whole series of DELs, containing (well, most likely) as many compounds as there are people on earth, and still not get a hit, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are also questions that DOS, diversity-oriented synthesis, was designed to help answer. I’ve always had &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/11/11/and_one_was_just_right&quot;&gt;reservations about that concept&lt;/a&gt;, but there have been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.2420&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30249-0&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; papers that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066158/&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt; to come out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392761/&quot;&gt;screening&lt;/a&gt; such collections. You can also see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171204/&quot;&gt;synthetic&lt;/a&gt; work &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.7b01776&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b06994&quot;&gt;reactions&lt;/a&gt; to make more diverse compounds sets feasible. Those papers, and more like them, are uncovered through a PubMed search on “Schreiber SL”, although there are others. One problem, though, is that a search for “diversity oriented synthesis” itself turns up both these papers and a mound of other stuff besides. There are an awful lot of papers that appropriate the term to mean “We made a bunch of stuff because we could and here it is”. The uncharitable view is that’s what the early DOS papers from the Broad added up to as well, but believe me, this other stuff is really the pits. When you see someone banging out a bunch of (say) chalcones and slapping a “diversity-oriented synthesis” label on the resulting work, well, it really makes you roll your eyes. Schreiber must love it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But has the DOS concept caught on outside the Broad Institute? It’s pretty labor-intensive, from a synthetic chemistry standpoint, although it’s designed to minimize that as much as possible once its time to actually make the libraries. But that’s a real “measure twice, cut once” situation; the last thing you want to do is rip into a big library synthesis that generates a bunch of half-made and truncated stuff instead of your desired Land of Diversity. I would like to have a better feel for how this is all working out. It may be that only organizations with significant manpower and funding can make a go of it, and significant bravery/nerve may be a requirement as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now DOS is, in the grand scheme of things, a series of shots into that gigantic chemical space mentioned above, and you could spend a lifetime at it and never make a dent in the number of untested areas – but (as above) is that the relevant question? The current version of it appears to be providing some interesting hits against interesting targets, and what more can you ask? It would be very worthwhile to study the hit rates (and hit quality) of DOS screening as practiced at the Broad versus what comes out of more conventional large compound collections, but if a large-scale comparison of this sort is publicly available, I’ve missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thoughts? How much effort is appropriate to beef up the screening collection, and what kind of return can one expect? Are you better letting the vendors clean out their closets and sell the stuff to you, or trying to make compounds yourself/pay someone to make them? What’s the comparative return on those? And the return versus and investment in DNA-encoded library technology (versus paying someone who does it already?) And does anyone do DOS-like stuff for themselves? Comments welcomed. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9a337f6e</fingerprint><crawled>1523024095919</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><title>Thoughts on Compound Collections</title><description>I’ve recently had similar questions from two different people (on two different coasts) about screening collections and compound libraries, so it seems like it could be a topic of interest.

The authors are going over a number of areas where medicinal chemistry could make use of more advanced synthetic techniques, and they’re good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, “&lt;em&gt;From an industry perspective, the most common challenge for any new synthetic method is its level of tolerance to the polar functional groups and nitrogen heteroatoms found in biologically active molecules.&lt;/em&gt;” Yes indeed. That’s what I look at when I see a neat new transformation in the literature – what did it work on? Basic amines OK? Tertiary or secondary? Secondary amides tolerated? Carboxylic acids? Free OH groups? I’m disappointed sometimes when I find that a reaction can’t tolerate these, but I’m glad that the papers involved at least went to the trouble of finding the limits to their chemistry. Far worse than that is a paper that tiptoes around the issues of chemical compatibility, leaving you to find out for yourself – if you’re so inclined, and often one is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area identified is late-stage functionalization, C-H bond activation, etc. Those reactions are always welcome, for sure. Chemical diversity is one of the names of the game that we play, and anything that allows us to get more of it quickly and reliably is good news. Blending with the above, the more complex and functionalized the molecules that can be used as substrates for such chemistry, the better. We’ll take fluorination, hydroxylation, amination, addition of methoxy, trifluoromethyl, what have you. It’s great to be able to predict where the functionalization will happen, of course, but there’s value in things that just sort of go in and mess with structures, too: new molecules! After all, that’s what the liver enzymes do to our drugs; we’re used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also calls for new ways to synthesize and functionalize small heterocyclic rings, new metal-catalyzed coupling reactions (and new C-C bond-forming reactions in general), more biomolecule-compatible reactions, and more. It also goes briefly into machine-assisted synthesis and software-assisted retrosynthesis, but the bulk of the paper is on synthetic methods, and I can only cheer on their suggestions. These are all potential areas for academic-industrial collaboration to generate new chemistry, because everyone benefits from success in these areas (indeed, some of this collaboration goes on already for just these reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I enjoyed this paper very much, but it starts off with a claim that’s worth arguing about: “&lt;em&gt;organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects&lt;/em&gt;“. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on where you’re standing. All the synthetic limitations described above are real, and they keep us from being able to make a lot of molecules that we’d otherwise be cranking out. But (and this is a big point) it’s rarely the case that we medicinal chemists identify a tricky new structure that absolutely has to be made. That sounds odd, but it comes down to our predictive powers, which aren’t so great. We don’t generally draw some wild compound up on the hood sash and say “That’s the one, folks: find a way to make it or die trying”. We never know which is the one, so in the absence of knowing, we make the things that we can make in the ways that we can make them, and honestly, much of the time, we can manage to come up with something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, though, things like the ability to make more polar compounds reliably and quickly would probably lead to better and more structurally diverse drug candidates and screening compounds, not to mention better starting points for projects in general. We just don’t know which ones. The main examples of specific compounds I can think of are metabolites or potential metabolites, where the liver has made some new polar compound out of an existing drug candidate, and we need to make the new compound(s) for testing. Those can be tough, and sometimes the only way is to grind out small quantities by exposing the drug to liver tissue itself (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for times we can’t come up with something, I would like to believe that far more diverse and interesting sets of compounds, millions of them, would allow for real hits to be found against target classes that we currently have trouble attacking. But that remains to be proven, if it ever can be. Chemical space is so large that you can always say “Well, your compound set still wasn’t big enough – the good ones are still out there”, and there’s no way to say that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the real killers in drug discovery stem from – to put it mildly – our incomplete understanding of biology. It’s Phase II and Phase III failures that hammer us, and those happen because we don’t understand our desirable (and undesirable) mechanisms of action enough, leading to failures in efficacy and safety. Even worse, they come after a big pile of money has been spent. Compared to these problems, generating chemical matter is not as big a concern. We already generate enough chemical matter to send all sorts of stuff into the clinic, where 80 to 90% of it dies for other reasons entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic chemistry is, of course, crucial to making small-molecule drugs, and you’d think that would be enough. But as a chemist, I wish that organic synthesis were more relevant to these deep problems. But in the big picture, it isn’t quite so. Chemical biology, as a field, is an attempt to make that happen, but How to Make will never be able to answer questions of What to Make and Why.&lt;/p&gt;

There is still no consensus on the true origin of fatal yellowing, one of the most important diseases affecting oil palm (&lt;i&gt;Elaeis guineensis&lt;/i&gt; Jacq.) plantations. This study involved two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MS&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;) analyses to identify changes in protein profiles of oil palms affected by FY disease. Oil palm roots were sampled from two growing areas. Differential accumulation of proteins was assessed by comparing plants with and without symptoms and between plants at different stages of FY development. Most of the proteins identified with differential accumulation were those related to stress response and energy metabolism. The latter proteins include the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, related to alcohol fermentation, which were identified in plants with and without symptoms. The presence of these enzymes suggests an anaerobic condition before or during FY. Transketolase, isoflavone reductase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and ferritin, among others, were identified as potential marker proteins and could be used to guide selection of FY-tolerant oil palm genotypes or to understand the source of this anomaly. When comparing different stages of FY, we observed high accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase and other abiotic stress related-proteins at all disease stages. On the other hand, biological stress-related proteins were more accumulated at later stages of the disease. These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195538</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>71aec6f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sidney Vasconcelos do Nascimento, Marcelo Murad Magalhães, Roberto Lisboa Cunha, Paulo Henrique de Oliveira Costa, Ronnie Cley de Oliveira Alves, Guilherme Corrêa de Oliveira, Rafael Borges da Silva Valadares&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was aimed at a serial evaluation and comparison of the prognostic values of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores for neurologic outcomes in comatose, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors, treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analysed a prospective cohort of comatose OHCA patients, with TTM, admitted to an emergency intensive care unit (ICU), between January 2010 and December 2015. SOFA and APACHE II scores were calculated initially, and then at day 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after ICU admission. Primary and secondary outcomes were the 28-day neurologic outcome and the 28-day mortality, respectively. Prognostic value of the SOFA and APACHE II scores was analysed using the receiver operating characteristic curve.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 143 selected patients, 62 survived and 34 had good neurologic outcomes at day 28. There was no significant difference in the SOFA and extracerebral SOFA scores between the good and poor neurologic outcome groups. However, the APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the good outcome group; they displayed good discriminatory power in predicting poor outcomes, unlike the SOFA scores. The APACHE II score at day 3 had the highest prognostic value for predicting poor neurologic outcomes with an area under the cure of 0.793, and with a cut-off value of 20, the APACHE II score predicted poor neurologic outcomes with a sensitivity of 43.75%, a specificity of 94.12%, a positive predictive value of 94.59%, and a negative predictive value of 41.56%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Identifying APACHE II score might assist as one piece of multimodal prognostic approach for the assessment of neurologic outcomes in OHCA survivors treated with TTM.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195628</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5d87e8eb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Chol Yoon, Youn-Jung Kim, You-Jin Lee, Seung Mok Ryoo, Chang Hwan Sohn, Dong-Woo Seo, Yoon-Seon Lee, Jae Ho Lee, Kyoung Soo Lim, Won Young Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Larvae of parasitoid wasps develop on a single arthropod host, and often face resource limitation that induces a tradeoff between egg maturation and somatic growth.

Larvae of parasitoid wasps develop on a single arthropod host, and often face resource limitation that induces a tradeoff between egg maturation and somatic growth. Part of the variation in the growth-reproduction allocation was shown to be heritable, but how the larval developmental environment affects this allocation is not well-known. Detection of life history tradeoffs is often facilitated under stress conditions. We therefore exposed developing female larvae of the polyembryonic parasitoid &lt;i&gt;Copidosoma koehleri&lt;/i&gt; (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) to laboratory manipulations aimed to restrict host resources (either host-starvation or high larval density).

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has short- and long- term influence on pregnant women and fetus. Swimming, as an aerobic exercise, can effectively improve the blood glucose level in GDM, but the effect of mild swimming alone was not very substantial. Metformin, as an oral antidiabetic drug, has obvious hypoglycemic effect, and is economic also, but the long-term effect on pregnant women and fetus has not been completely clear. We hypothesize that combined intervention of mild swimming and low dose of metformin, may effectively reduce blood glucose, improve the pregnancy outcomes in GDM dams, but simultaneously avoiding the adverse effects caused by overdose of drug and impotence of mild swimming. The streptozotocin was used to stimulate C57BL/6J mice to develop GDM, by which serum glucose, TC, TG, LDL-C were increased significantly, meanwhile HDL-C was decreased significantly in the GDM control (DC) group compared with the normal control group. Swimming or metformin intervention slightly or moderately improves hyperglycemia, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice, while combined therapy of swimming plus metformin markedly ameliorated hyperglycemia (FPG, decreased by 22.2–59.5% from G10 to G18 versus DC group), insulin sensitivity (2.1 and 2.8 fold increase, respectively, in AKT activity versus DC group) and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; lipogenesis (3.2 and 7.0 fold decrease, respectively, in ACC activity, and 1.94 and 5.1 fold decrease, respectively, in SREBP2 level, versus DC group) both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice. We conclude that the combined intervention by metformin plus swimming may be more effective than single action to ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; improving insulin sensitivity in GDM mice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195609</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bcdbc13d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liping Huang, Pingping Yue, Xuefei Wu, Ting Yu, Yang Wang, Ji Zhou, Derun Kong, Keyang Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Past and recent attempts at devising objective biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid have focused on abundance measures of time-dependent proteins. Similar independent determinants would be most welcome in diagnosing the most common form of TBI, mild TBI (mTBI), which remains difficult to define and confirm based solely on clinical criteria. There are currently no consensus diagnostic measures that objectively define individuals as having sustained an acute mTBI. Plasma metabolomic analyses have recently evolved to offer an alternative to proteomic analyses, offering an orthogonal diagnostic measure to what is currently available. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a developed set of metabolomic biomarkers is able to objectively classify college athletes sustaining mTBI from non-injured teammates, within 6 hours of trauma and whether such a biomarker panel could be effectively applied to an independent cohort of TBI and control subjects.
A 6-metabolite panel was developed from biomarkers that had their identities confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in our Athlete cohort. These biomarkers were defined at ≤6 hours following mTBI and objectively classified mTBI athletes from teammate controls, and provided similar classification of these groups at the 2, 3, and 7 days post-mTBI. The same 6-metabolite panel, when applied to a separate, independent cohort provided statistically similar results despite major differences between the two cohorts. Our confirmed plasma biomarker panel objectively classifies acute mTBI cases from controls within 6 hours of injury in our two independent cohorts. While encouraged by our initial results, we expect future studies to expand on these initial observations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195318</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b26b5f5c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Massimo S.

Aquaculture is increasing rapidly to meet global seafood demand. Some hydroid populations have been linked to mortality and health issues in finfish and shellfish, but their dynamics in and around aquaculture farms remain understudied. In the present work, two experiments, each with 36 panels, tested colonization (factors: depth, season of immersion) and succession (factors: depth, submersion duration) over one year. Hydroid surface cover was estimated for each species, and data were analyzed with multivariate techniques. The assemblage of hydrozoans was species-poor, although species richness, frequency and abundance increased with time, paralleling the overall increase in structural complexity of fouling assemblages. Submersion duration and season of immersion were particularly important in determining the species composition of the assemblages in the succession and colonization experiments, respectively. Production of water-borne propagules, including medusae, from the hydroids was observed from locally abundant colonies, among them the well-known fouling species &lt;i&gt;Obelia dichotoma&lt;/i&gt;, potentially representing a nuisance for cultured fish through contact-driven envenomations and gill disorders. The results illustrate the potential importance of fouling hydroids and their medusae to the health of organisms in the aquaculture industry.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195352</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cbb54754</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luis Martell, Roberta Bracale, Steven A.

A two-phase feeding study evaluating performance of rainbow trout and comparing luminal and mucosal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) bacterial community compositions when fed two alternative protein diets in two rearing systems was conducted. Alternative protein diets (animal protein and plant protein diets) balanced with crystalline amino acids: lysine, methionine and threonine or unbalanced, were fed to rainbow trout in two separate water systems (recirculating (RR) and flow-through (FF)) for a period of 16 weeks. The four diets, each contained 38% digestible protein and 20% fats, were fed to rainbow trout with an average weight of 12.02 ± 0.61 g, and sorted at 30 fish/tank and 12 tanks per dietary treatment. Phase 1 lasted for 8 weeks after which fish from each tank were randomly divided, with one-half moved to new tanks of the opposing system (i.e. from RR to FF and vice versa). The remaining halves were retained in their initial tank and system, and fed their original diets for another 8 weeks (phase 2). After the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; week, 3 fish/tank were sampled for each of proximate analysis, body indexes and 16S rRNA analysis of GIT microbiota. Fish weight (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0030, P&amp;lt;0.0010) and body fat (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0041, P = 0.0177) were significantly affected by diet, diet quality (balanced or unbalanced) and system, respectively. Feed intake (P = 0.0008) and body energy (P&amp;lt;0.0010) were altered by system. Body indexes were not affected by dietary treatment and water systems. Compositional dissimilarities existed between samples from the rearing water and GIT locations (ANOSIM: (R = 0.29, P = 0.0010), PERMANOVA: R = 0.39, P = 0.0010), but not in dietary samples (ANOSIM: R = 0.004, P = 0.3140, PERMANOVA: R = 0.008, P = 0.4540).

A two-phase feeding study evaluating performance of rainbow trout and comparing luminal and mucosal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) bacterial community compositions when fed two alternative protein diets in two rearing systems was conducted. Alternative protein diets (animal protein and plant protein diets) balanced with crystalline amino acids: lysine, methionine and threonine or unbalanced, were fed to rainbow trout in two separate water systems (recirculating (RR) and flow-through (FF)) for a period of 16 weeks. The four diets, each contained 38% digestible protein and 20% fats, were fed to rainbow trout with an average weight of 12.02 ± 0.61 g, and sorted at 30 fish/tank and 12 tanks per dietary treatment. Phase 1 lasted for 8 weeks after which fish from each tank were randomly divided, with one-half moved to new tanks of the opposing system (i.e. from RR to FF and vice versa). The remaining halves were retained in their initial tank and system, and fed their original diets for another 8 weeks (phase 2). After the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; week, 3 fish/tank were sampled for each of proximate analysis, body indexes and 16S rRNA analysis of GIT microbiota. Fish weight (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0030, P&amp;lt;0.0010) and body fat (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0041, P = 0.0177) were significantly affected by diet, diet quality (balanced or unbalanced) and system, respectively.

Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Evidence suggests the microclimate of the classroom is an important factor influencing female course grades and interest, which encourages retention of women in STEM fields. Here, we test whether the gender composition of small (8–9 person) learning groups impacts course performance, sense of social belonging, and intragroup peer evaluations of intellectual contributions. Across two undergraduate active learning courses in introductory biology, we manipulated the classroom microclimate by varying the gender ratios of learning groups, ranging from 0% female to 100% female. We found that as the percent of women in groups increased, so did overall course performance for all students, regardless of gender. Additionally, women assigned higher peer- evaluations in groups with more women than groups with less women. Our work demonstrates an added benefit of the retention of women in STEM: increased performance for all, and positive peer perceptions for women.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195129</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bb7961bc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lauren L.

Our human model of nasal colonization and eradication of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; is limited by safety issues. As rhesus macaques are closely related to humans and natural hosts for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;, we developed an experimental decolonization and inoculation protocol in these animals. Animals were screened for nasal carriage of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; and 20 carriers were selected. Decolonization was attempted using nasal mupirocin (10 animals) or mupirocin plus trimethoprim/sulfadiazine intramuscularly (10 animals) both once daily for 5 days, and checked by follow-up cultures for 10 weeks. Intranasal inoculation was performed with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; strain 8325–4 in culture-negative animals. 11/20 animals, of which 5 received mupirocin and 6 the combination treatment, became culture-negative for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; for 10 weeks and these 11 animals were subsequently inoculated. Swabs were taken once a week for 5 weeks to test for the presence of the inoculated strain. In 3 animals, strain 8325–4 was cultured from the nose 1 week after inoculation, indicating short-term survival of this strain only, a finding similar to that previously found in our human model. These data demonstrate that rhesus macaques may constitute a relevant animal model to perform &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; eradication and inoculation studies with relatively limited invasive handling of the animals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194718</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bd1894e1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bibi C.

These data demonstrate that rhesus macaques may constitute a relevant animal model to perform &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; eradication and inoculation studies with relatively limited invasive handling of the animals.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194718</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Bibi C.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Common colds are the most frequently encountered disease worldwide and the most frequent reason for self-care. According to the cross-sectional European Common Colds study (COCO), patients use as many as 12 items on average for self-care. Little is known about the influence of discomfort and knowledge on self-care for common colds.&lt;/p&gt; Main objective &lt;p&gt;To understand the influence of patients’ discomfort during a cold and their knowledge about the self-limited disease course on the use of self-care measures.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This COCO analysis included 2,204 patients from 22 European primary care sites in 12 countries. Each site surveyed 120 consecutive adults with a 27-item questionnaire asking about patients’ self-care, subjective discomfort during a cold (discomfort: yes/no), and knowledge about the self-limited course (yes/no). Country-specific medians of the number of self-care items served as a cut-off to define high and low self-care use. Four groups were stratified based on discomfort (yes/no) and knowledge (yes/no).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Participants’ mean age was 46.5 years, 61.7% were female; 36.3% lacked knowledge; 70.6% reported discomfort. The group &lt;i&gt;has discomfort/no knowledge&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the highest mean item use (13.3), followed by &lt;i&gt;has discomfort/has knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (11.9), &lt;i&gt;no discomfort/no knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (11.1), and &lt;i&gt;no discomfort/has knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (8.8). High use was associated with discomfort (OR 1.8; CI 1.5–2.2), female gender (OR 1.7; 1.4–2.0), chronic pain/arthritis (OR 1.6; 1.2–2.1), more years of education (OR 1.3; 1.1–1.6), age &amp;lt;48 years (OR 1.3; 1.0–1.5), and lack of knowledge (OR 1.2; 1.0–1.4).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Counseling on common colds should address patients’ discomfort and soothing measures in addition to providing information on the natural disease course.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a75a52e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anika Thielmann, Biljana Gerasimovska-Kitanovska, Tuomas H.

During hemolysis, hemoglobin and heme released from red blood cells promote oxidative stress, inflammation and thrombosis. Plasma haptoglobin and hemopexin scavenge free hemoglobin and heme, respectively, but can be depleted in hemolytic states. Haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation protect tissues, including the vasculature, liver and kidneys. It is widely assumed that these protective effects are due primarily to hemoglobin and heme clearance from the vasculature. However, this simple assumption does not account for the consequent cytoprotective adaptation seen in cells and organs. To further address the mechanism, we used a hyperhemolytic murine model (Townes-SS) of sickle cell disease to examine cellular responses to haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation. A single infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin (± equimolar hemoglobin) in SS-mice increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the liver, kidney and skin several fold within 1 hour and decreased nuclear NF-ĸB phospho-p65, and vaso-occlusion for 48 hours after infusion. Plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were not significantly changed 1 hour after infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin. Haptoglobin and hemopexin also inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation and lipopolysaccharide-induced vaso-occlusion in SS-mice. Inhibition of HO-1 activity with tin protoporphyrin blocked the protections afforded by haptoglobin and hemopexin in SS-mice. The HO-1 reaction product carbon monoxide, fully restored the protection, in part by inhibiting Weibel-Palade body mobilization of P-selectin and von Willebrand factor to endothelial cell surfaces. Thus, the mechanism by which haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation in hyperhemolytic SS-mice induces cytoprotective cellular responses is linked to increased HO-1 activity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196455</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f971aa14</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by John D.

We evaluated the feasibility and safety of nictitating membrane fixation to address reduced contact lens stability by the nictitating membrane in a rabbit model. Under general anesthesia, twelve animals received a horizontal mattress suture between the nictitating membrane and the upper eyelid of one eye. To assess the effects of this technique and secondary side effects, contact lens stability test, Schirmer tear test, tear break-up time measurement, eye tissue pathology and morphology were evaluated. Contact lens stability was increased after nictitating membrane fixation. The percentage of contact lens retention in the nictitating membrane fixed rabbit after 4 hours was 90% whereas that in the untreated rabbit was 42.5%. In addition, there were no significant differences in tear quantity and quality between the fixed and untreated eyes. Furthermore, no remarkable pathological lesions were found in gross observation during the 1-month time period or the following pathological examination. In this study, we demonstrated that nictitating membrane fixation increases contact lens stability without specific side effects using a rabbit model. This minimally invasive procedure could be useful when designing animal models for testing new contact lenses and has potential to apply to other biomaterial research on the ocular surface.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194795</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bfc59809</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Sustained virological response (SVR) rates have increased remarkably since the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C. Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme converting lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid and a newly established biomarker for liver fibrosis. Interferon-free DAA regimens for chronic hepatitis C could improve liver stiffness in SVR patients according to several non-invasive evaluation methods, but the clinical response and significance of ATX in this context have not yet been defined. We therefore investigated sequential serum ATX levels at baseline, 4 weeks after the start of treatment, and 24 weeks after treatment in 159 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients who received DAA therapy. Other non-invasive fibrosis markers (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio and FIB-4 index) were examined as well. Baseline median ATX levels were comparable between the 144 patients who achieved a SVR and the 15 who did not (1.54 vs. 1.62 mg/L), but median ATX levels became significantly decreased during and after DAA therapy in the SVR group only (from 1.54 to 1.40 and 1.31 mg/L, respectively; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ATX was significantly decreased between baseline and 4 weeks of treatment in overall, male, and female SVR patients (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In subjects with low necroinflammatory activity in the liver (i.e., alanine aminotransferase &amp;lt; 30 U/L), ATX levels were significantly reduced from baseline to 4 weeks of treatment and remained low (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) in patients with a SVR. Thus, interferon-free DAA therapy was associated with a significant decrease in serum ATX levels in patients achieving a SVR, suggesting early regression of liver fibrosis in addition to inflammation treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195632</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d54f7625</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoo Yamazaki, Satoru Joshita, Takeji Umemura, Yoko Usami, Ayumi Sugiura, Naoyuki Fujimori, Takefumi Kimura, Akihiro Matsumoto, Koji Igarashi, Masao Ota, Eiji Tanaka&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, interferon-free DAA therapy was associated with a significant decrease in serum ATX levels in patients achieving a SVR, suggesting early regression of liver fibrosis in addition to inflammation treatment.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195632</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Tomoo Yamazaki</name></author><title>Changes in serum levels of autotaxin with direct-acting antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522875600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ecd:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195632</link><published>1522875600000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00131</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00131/20180418/images/medium/bi-2018-00131e_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00131&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Thirteen variants (13/128, 10%) were ultimately classified as pathogenic. Most deaths (63%) occurred during sleep. Gene variant carriage was more likely with a positive medical history (mostly seizures, 63% vs 36%, p = 0.01), amongst females (36% vs 12%, p = 0.001) and whites more than Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Children 1–12 years were more likely to be gene-positive (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Family screening identified 42 gene-positive relatives, 18 with definitive phenotypic expression of LQTS/Brugada. 76% of the variants were maternally inherited (p = 0.007). Further family investigations and research now support pathogenicity of the variant in 13/27 (48%) of gene-positive cases.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, variants in &lt;i&gt;SCN5A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KCNH2&lt;/i&gt;, with maternal inheritance, predominate. A rare variant in LQTS genes is more likely in whites rather than Maori, females, children 1–12 years and those with a positive personal and family history of seizures, syncope or SUDY.

Iron plays vital roles in the human body including enzymatic processes, oxygen-transport via hemoglobin and immune response. Iron metabolism is characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron dextran. This &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical experiments. Such an approach could pave the way for development of effective personalized treatment of CKD anemia.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mfiym6I-5Rs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joydeep Sarkar, Alka A.

Mosquitoes function as important vectors for many diseases globally and can have substantial negative economic, environmental, and health impacts. Specifically, West Nile virus (WNv) is a significant and increasing threat to wildlife populations and human health throughout North America. Mosquito control is an important means of controlling the spread of WNv, as the virus is primarily spread between avian and mosquito vectors. This is of particular concern for avian host species such as the Greater sage-grouse (&lt;i&gt;Centrocercus urophasianus&lt;/i&gt;), in which WNv negatively impacts fitness parameters. Most mosquito control methods focus on the larval stages. In North America, control efforts are largely limited to larvicides, which require repeated application and have potentially negative ecological impacts. There are multiple potential advantages to using indigenous fish species as an alternative for larval control including lowered environmental impact, decreased costs in terms of time and financial inputs, and the potential for the establishment of self-sustaining fish populations. We tested the efficacy of using fathead minnows (&lt;i&gt;Pimephales promelas&lt;/i&gt;) as biological control for mosquito populations in livestock reservoirs of semiarid rangelands. We introduced minnows into 10 treatment reservoirs and monitored an additional 6 non-treated reservoirs as controls over 3 years. Adult mosquitoes of species known to transmit WNv (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Culex tarsalis&lt;/i&gt;) were captured at each site and mosquito larvae were also present at all sites. Stable isotope analysis confirmed that introduced fathead minnows were feeding at the mosquito larvae trophic level in all but one treatment pond. Treatment ponds demonstrated suppressed levels of mosquito larva over each season compared to controls with a model-predicted 114% decrease in larva density within treatment ponds. Minnows established self-sustaining populations throughout the study in all reservoirs that maintained sufficient water levels. Minnow survival was not influenced by water quality. Though minnows did not completely eradicate mosquito larvae, minnows are a promising alternative to controlling mosquito larvae density within reservoirs. We caution that careful site selection is critical to avoid potential negative impacts, but suggest the introduction of fathead minnows in reservoirs can dramatically reduce mosquito larva abundance and potentially help mitigate vector-borne disease transmission.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194304</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7538efc3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryan T.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA. HMR programs provide weekly group coaching to achieve reduced calorie intake, increased fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity ≥2,000 kcal/wk. A Markov model predicted avoidance of diabetes and cardiovascular events and projected cost savings due to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 500 patients included in the analysis, 67% were female and mean age was 54.1 years (s.d. 11.6). The baseline weight and BMI were 243.5 lbs (range 144.0–545.0) and 38.8 kg/m2 (range 25.4–85.0), respectively. Overall, patients lost an average of 47.4 lbs (18.9% of initial body weight [IBW]); the amount of weight loss was consistent among those with diabetes/pre-diabetes (50%), high/moderate risk for dyslipidemia (60%), hypertension/pre-hypertension (86%), and severe obesity (37%). The mean IBW lost was 16.4%, 19.3%, 20.7% for ≤6 months (n = 165), 7–12 months (n = 140), 13–24 months (n = 195) of program participation, respectively. The simulation model estimated 22 diabetes and 30 cardiovascular events and $1,992,370 medical costs avoided over 5 years in the 500 patients evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Patients in the HMR clinic-based HILI program achieved substantial weight loss regardless of duration of program participation, risk profile and comorbid status. The HMR program could be an effective strategy to prevent costly diabetes and cardiovascular events, particularly in high risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195794</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524073508287</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ea771b4c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Gotthelf, Ya-Ting Chen, Srinivasan Rajagopalan, Elise Chi-Tao Wu, Ishita Doshi, Carol Addy&lt;/p&gt;

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity. Species conservation, however, requires species identification skills, a competence obtained through intensive training and experience. Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition. The idea of automated species identification is approaching reality. We review the technical status quo on computer vision approaches for plant species identification, highlight the main research challenges to overcome in providing applicable tools, and conclude with a discussion of open and future research thrusts.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bfmDpVYKmqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jana Wäldchen, Michael Rzanny, Marco Seeland, Patrick Mäder&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Delivery of effective healthcare is contingent on the quality of communication between the patient and the healthcare provider.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products contain various amounts of dimeric IgG complexes. Current insights into the possible biological activities of these dimers remain controversial, and both immunemodulating and immune-activating effects have been reported. Here, we analyzed the putative immune-activating effects of dimers isolated from IVIg.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Dimers isolated from IVIg were purified by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) and tested for the ability to induce neutrophil degranulation in vitro.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Dimers isolated from IVIg were found to be incapable of inducing in vitro neutrophil degranulation or complement activation, even at concentrations exceeding those expected to be reached upon administration in patients. These results depend on the removal of artefactual activation by using 0.1 micron filtration and the use of poloxamer to prevent adsorption of IgG onto the solid phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The data suggest dimeric IgG found in IVIg may bind to Fc-receptors without causing activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195729</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>99668730</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Iwan Kustiawan, Ninotska I.

The importance of patch quality for amphibians is frequently overlooked in distribution models. Here we demonstrate that it is highly important for the persistence of endemic and endangered amphibians found in the threatened and fragile ecosystems that are the rocky plateaus in Western Maharashtra, India. These plateaus are ferricretes of laterite and characterise the northern section of the Western Ghats/Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, the eighth most important global hotspot and one of the three most threatened by population growth. We present statistically supported habitat associations for endangered and data-deficient Indian amphibians, demonstrating significant relationships between individual species and their microhabitats. Data were collected during early monsoon across two seasons. Twenty-one amphibian taxa were identified from 14 lateritic plateaus between 67 and 1179m above sea level. Twelve of the study taxa had significant associations with microhabitats using a stepwise analysis of the AICc subroutine (distLM, Primer-e, v7). Generalist taxa were associated with increased numbers of microhabitat types. Non-significant associations are reported for the remaining 9 taxa. Microhabitat distribution was spatially structured and driven by climate and human activity. Woody plants were associated with 44% of high-elevation taxa. Of the 8 low-elevation taxa 63% related to water bodies and 60% of those were associated with pools. Rock size and abundance were important for 33% of high elevation specialists. Three of the 4 caecilians were associated with rocks in addition to soil and stream presence. We conclude the plateaus are individualistic patches whose habitat quality is defined by their microhabitats within climatic zones.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194810</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b2123d08</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher J.

Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in sheep and an example of a disease that may be controlled through breeding for disease resistance. Member states of the European Union have introduced strategies for breeding against scrapie based on the selection of genetically resistant breeding rams. An ambitious strategy adopted in The Netherlands consisted of selecting resistant rams for breeding throughout both breeding and production sectors. Mathematical modelling of the effect of a breeding program on the spreading capacity of scrapie in a national flock is needed for making assessments on how long a breeding strategy needs to be maintained to achieve disease control. Here we describe such a model applied to the Dutch situation, with the use of data on the genetic content of the Dutch sheep population as well as on scrapie occurrence in this population. We show that the time needed for obtaining scrapie control depends crucially on two parameters measuring sheep population structure: the between-flock heterogeneity in genotype frequencies, and the heterogeneity of mixing (contact rates) between sheep flocks. Estimating the first parameter from Dutch genetic survey data and assuming scenario values for the second one, enables model prediction of the time needed to achieve scrapie control in The Netherlands.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195009</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ad6de948</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas J.

Understanding species-specific changes in water-use patterns under recent climate scenarios is necessary to predict accurately the responses of seasonally dry ecosystems to future climate. In this study, we conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment to investigate the changes in water-use patterns of two coexisting species (&lt;i&gt;Achnatherum splendens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Allium tanguticum&lt;/i&gt;) to alterations in soil water content (SWC) resulting from increased and decreased rainfall treatments. The results showed that the leaf water potential (Ψ) of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;splendens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tanguticum&lt;/i&gt; responded to changes in shallow and middle SWC at both the control and treatment plots. However, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;splendens&lt;/i&gt; proportionally extracted water from the shallow soil layer (0–10cm) when it was available but shifted to absorbing deep soil water (30–60 cm) during drought. By contrast, the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tanguticum&lt;/i&gt; did not differ significantly in uptake depth between treatment and control plots but entirely depended on water from shallow soil layers.

Anti-predator signaling is highly variable with numerous examples of species employing cryptic coloration to avoid detection or conspicuous coloration (often coupled with a secondary defense) to ensure detection and recollection. While the ends of this spectrum are clear in their function, how species use intermediate signals is less clear. Australian Brood Frogs (&lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;) display conspicuous coloration on both their dorsum and venter. Coupled with the alkaloid toxins these frogs possess, this coloration may be aposematic, providing a protective warning signal to predators.

Anti-predator signaling is highly variable with numerous examples of species employing cryptic coloration to avoid detection or conspicuous coloration (often coupled with a secondary defense) to ensure detection and recollection. While the ends of this spectrum are clear in their function, how species use intermediate signals is less clear. Australian Brood Frogs (&lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;) display conspicuous coloration on both their dorsum and venter. Coupled with the alkaloid toxins these frogs possess, this coloration may be aposematic, providing a protective warning signal to predators. We assessed predation rates of known and novel color patterns and found no difference for avian or mammalian predators. However, when &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt; dorsal phenotypes were collectively compared to the high-contrast ventral phenotype of this genus, we found birds, but not mammals, attacked dorsal phenotypes significantly less frequently than the ventral phenotype. This study, importantly, shows a differential predator response to ventral coloration in this genus which has implications for the evolution of conspicuous signaling in &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195446</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>J.

Freshwater reservoir offsets (FROs) occur when AMS dates on charred, encrusted food residues on pottery predate a pot’s chronological context because of the presence of ancient carbon from aquatic resources such as fish. Research over the past two decades has demonstrated that FROs vary widely within and between water bodies and between fish in those water bodies. Lipid analyses have identified aquatic biomarkers that can be extracted from cooking residues as potential evidence for FROs. However, lacking has been efforts to determine empirically how much fish with FROs needs to be cooked in a pot with other resources to result in significant FRO on encrusted cooking residue and what percentage of fish C in a residue is needed to result in the recovery of aquatic biomarkers. Here we provide preliminary assessments of both issues. Our results indicate that in historically-contingent, high alkalinity environments &amp;lt;20% C from fish may result in a statistically significant FRO, but that biomarkers for aquatic resources may be present in the absence of a significant FRO.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196407</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>caa5cb94</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by John P.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Individuals with metabolic syndrome have increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CR-fitness), counteracts accumulation of visceral fat, decreases inflammation and lowers risk factors of the metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;The study sample included 1,293 Danes (age 49–52 years) who from 2009 to 2011 participated in the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank, including a questionnaire, physical tests, and blood samples. Multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and plasma levels of cytokines and high sensitive C-reactive protein as outcomes and measures of abdominal obesity were added to test if they explained the potential association. Similarly, multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and factors of the metabolic syndrome as outcomes and the potential explanation by inflammatory biomarkers were tested. All models were adjusted for the effect of age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, socio-economic status, and acute inflammatory events within the preceding two weeks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;CR-fitness was inversely associated with high sensitive C-reactive protein, Interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-18, and directly associated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma or IL-1β. Abdominal obesity could partly explain the significant associations. Moreover, CR-fitness was inversely associated with an overall metabolic syndrome score, as well as triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin A&lt;sub&gt;1c&lt;/sub&gt;, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and directly associated with high-density lipoprotein. Single inflammatory biomarkers and a combined inflammatory score partly explained these associations.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Data suggest that CR-fitness has anti-inflammatory effects that are partly explained by a reduction in abdominal obesity and a decrease in the metabolic syndrome risk profile. The overall inflammatory load was mainly driven by high sensitive C-reactive protein and IL-6.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194991</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>891b71d8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne-Sophie Wedell-Neergaard, Rikke Krogh-Madsen, Gitte Lindved Petersen, Åse Marie Hansen, Bente Klarlund Pedersen, Rikke Lund, Helle Bruunsgaard&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular and respiratory effects of two volumes of bupivacaine 0.25% (0.2 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—treatment BUP02—and 0.4 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; –treatment BUP04) administered epidurally at the lumbosacral intervertebral space in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane. This experimental prospective randomized crossover design trial used six mixed breed adult dogs, four neutered males and two spayed females. Each dog was anesthetized on three different occasions: the first for isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) measurement, and the following two assigned treatments (BUP02 or BUP04). On the two treatment days, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane at 1.3 MAC during the experiments. Cardiovascular and respiratory measurements were recorded before (T0) and 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the epidural administration of bupivacaine. Comparisons between and within groups were performed by a mixed-model ANOVA and Friedman’s test when appropriate followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test or Dunnet’s test to compare time points within each treatment with T0 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly from 15 to 90 minutes after the administration of BUP02 and from 5 to 60 minutes in BUP04, with lower values in BUP04 than in BUP02 lasting up to 30 minutes after bupivacaine administration. No significant changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were observed in either treatment. Hypoventilation was only detected in BUP04. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial oxygen content decreased after both treatment of bupivacaine with no significant decrease in oxygen delivery. Two dogs in BUP04 developed Horner’s syndrome. The epidural administration of 0.4 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of bupivacaine to dogs in sternal recumbency anesthetized with isoflurane 1.3 MAC caused more cardiovascular and respiratory depression than 0.2 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195867</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>84badf49</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Raquel Sartori Gonçalves Dias, João Henrique Neves Soares, Douglas dos Santos e Castro, Maria Alice Kuster de Albuquerque Gress, Marcela Lemos Machado, Pablo E.

Objective &lt;p&gt;In previous work we have developed a fast sequence that focusses on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based on the long T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of CSF. By processing the data obtained with this CSF MRI sequence, brain parenchymal volume (BPV) and intracranial volume (ICV) can be automatically obtained. The aim of this study was to assess the precision of the BPV and ICV measurements of the CSF MRI sequence and to validate the CSF MRI sequence by comparison with 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-based brain segmentation methods.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Ten healthy volunteers (2 females; median age 28 years) were scanned (3T MRI) twice with repositioning in between. The scan protocol consisted of a low resolution (LR) CSF sequence (0:57min), a high resolution (HR) CSF sequence (3:21min) and a 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequence (6:47min). Data of the HR 3D-T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images were downsampled to obtain LR T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images (reconstructed imaging time: 1:59 min). Data of the CSF MRI sequences was automatically segmented using in-house software. The 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images were segmented using FSL (5.0), SPM12 and FreeSurfer (5.3.0).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean absolute differences for BPV and ICV between the first and second scan for CSF LR (BPV/ICV: 12±9/7±4cc) and CSF HR (5±5/4±2cc) were comparable to FSL HR (9±11/19±23cc), FSL LR (7±4, 6±5cc), FreeSurfer HR (5±3/14±8cc), FreeSurfer LR (9±8, 12±10cc), and SPM HR (5±3/4±7cc), and SPM LR (5±4, 5±3cc). The correlation between the measured volumes of the CSF sequences and that measured by FSL, FreeSurfer and SPM HR and LR was very good (all Pearson’s correlation coefficients &gt;0.83, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; .67–.97). The results from the downsampled data and the high-resolution data were similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Both CSF MRI sequences have a precision comparable to, and a very good correlation with established 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-based automated segmentations methods for the segmentation of BPV and ICV.

However, the short imaging time of the fast CSF MRI sequence is superior to the 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sequence on which segmentation with established methods is performed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196119</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Lisa A. van der Kleij</name></author><title>Fast CSF MRI for brain segmentation; Cross-validation by comparison with 3D T&amp;lt;sub&gt;1&amp;lt;/sub&gt;-based brain segmentation methods</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524171600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f78fb:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196119</link><published>1524171600000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00208</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00208/20180329/images/medium/jm-2018-00208v_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00208&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Here we demonstrate the application of a method that could accelerate the development of novel therapies by allowing direct and repeatable visualization of cellular function in the living eye, to study loss of vision in animal models of retinal disease, as well as evaluate the time course of retinal function following therapeutic intervention. We use high-resolution adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy to image fluorescence from the calcium sensor GCaMP6s. In mice with photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), we measured restored visual responses in ganglion cell layer neurons expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin ChrimsonR over a six-week period following significant loss of visual responses. Combining a fluorescent calcium sensor, a channelrhodopsin, and adaptive optics enables all-optical stimulation and recording of retinal neurons in the living eye. Because the retina is an accessible portal to the central nervous system, our method also provides a novel non-invasive method of dissecting neuronal processing in the brain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8b125121</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Soon Keen Cheong, Jennifer M.

In mice with photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), we measured restored visual responses in ganglion cell layer neurons expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin ChrimsonR over a six-week period following significant loss of visual responses. Combining a fluorescent calcium sensor, a channelrhodopsin, and adaptive optics enables all-optical stimulation and recording of retinal neurons in the living eye. Because the retina is an accessible portal to the central nervous system, our method also provides a novel non-invasive method of dissecting neuronal processing in the brain.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Soon Keen Cheong</name></author><title>All-optical recording and stimulation of retinal neurons &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; in retinal degeneration mice</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>61</engagement><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0e:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</link><published>1522357200000</published></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011056?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d549783b</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011056?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ngo Minh Toan</name></author><title>Forced-rupture of cell-adhesion complexes reveals abrupt switch between two brittle states</title><unread>True</unread><published>1520387556000</published><engagement>0</engagement><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88de:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011056?af=R</link><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32963</originId><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32963</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523452551268</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4af53973</fingerprint><description>Most transcription factors (TFs) can bind to a population of sequences closely related to a single optimal site.

Background &lt;p&gt;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are regarded as the cornerstone of conventional treatment for AS. However little is known about concomitant NSAID use during treatment (with TNF-α inhibitors) in daily clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Consecutive patients from the GLAS cohort were included. NSAID use and ASAS-NSAID index were evaluated at group level and at individual patient level during 52 weeks of follow-up. Analyses were stratified for treatment regimen. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to evaluate NSAID use in relation to assessments of disease activity over time. In patients starting TNF-α inhibitors (n = 254), 79% used NSAIDs at baseline and this proportion decreased significantly to 38% at 52 weeks. ASAS-NSAID index also decreased significantly from median 65 to 0. In patients on conventional treatment (n = 139), 74% used NSAIDs at baseline with median ASAS-NSAID index of 50 and this remained stable during follow-up. At each follow-up visit, approximately half of the patients changed their type or dose of NSAIDs. GEE analysis over time showed that NSAID use was associated with AS disease activity score (p&amp;lt;0.05). This relation was more pronounced in patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors compared to conventional treatment (B = 0.825 vs. B = 0.250).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this observational cohort of established AS patients, there was no difference in baseline NSAID use between patients with and without indication for TNF-α inhibitors.

Background &lt;p&gt;Levothyroxine replacement treatment in hypothyroidism is unable to restore physiological thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations in serum and tissues completely. Normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations reflect only pituitary euthyroidism and, therefore, novel biomarkers representing tissue-specific thyroid state are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding regulatory RNAs, exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns and can be detectable in serum. Previous studies have demonstrated differential expression of (precursors of) miRNAs in tissues under the influence of thyroid hormone.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study if serum miRNA profiles are changed in different thyroid states.&lt;/p&gt; Design and methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 13 athyroid patients (6 males) during TSH suppressive therapy and after 4 weeks of thyroid hormone withdrawal. A magnetic bead capture system was used to isolate 384 defined miRNAs from serum. Subsequently, the TaqMan Array Card 3.0 platform was used for profiling after individual target amplification.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of the subjects was 44.0 years (range 20–61 years). Median TSH levels were 88.9 mU/l during levothyroxine withdrawal and 0.006 mU/l during LT4 treatment with a median dosage of 2.1 μg/kg. After normalization to allow inter-sample analysis, a paired analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in expression of any of the 384 miRNAs analyzed on and off LT4 treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although we previously showed an up-regulation of pri-miRNAs 133b and 206 in hypothyroid state in skeletal muscle, the present study does not supply evidence that thyroid state also affects serum miRNAs in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194259</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>78447b54</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elske T.

Both stem cell therapy and physical treatments have been shown to be beneficial in accelerating bone healing. However, the efficacy of combined treatment with stem cells and physical stimuli for large bone defects remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone regeneration effects of low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) and human adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) treatments during fracture repair using a comparative rat calvarial defect model. We evaluated the viability of human ADSCs, which were cultured on a porous PLGA scaffold using an MTS assay. The critical-sized calvarial bone defect rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPLI group, ADSC group, and ADSC+LPLI group. Bone formation was evaluated using micro-CT. New bone formation areas and osteogenic factor expression levels were then examined by histomorphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Our data showed that PLGA had no cytotoxic effect on human ADSCs. Micro-CT analyses revealed that both the LPLI and ADSC groups showed improved calvarial bone defect healing compared to the control group. In addition, the ADSC+LPLI group showed significantly increased bone volume at 16 weeks after surgery. The area of new bone formation ranked as follows: control group &amp;lt; LPLI group &amp;lt; ADSC group &amp;lt; ADSC+LPLI group. There were significant differences between the groups. In addition, both ADSC and ADSC+LPLI groups showed strong signals of vWF expression. ADSC and LPLI treatments improved fracture repair in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats. Importantly, the combined treatment of ADSCs and LPLI further enhances the bone healing process.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195337</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3df21530</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yan-Hsiung Wang, Jyun-Yi Wu, Su Chii Kong, Min-Hsuan Chiang, Mei-Ling Ho, Ming-Long Yeh, Chia-Hsin Chen&lt;/p&gt;

TB infection in patients after kidney transplantation remains a concern in a successful long-term outcome. This retrospective, descriptive study was performed on tuberculosis infection after kidney transplantation in the Department of Infectious Disease of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, a tertiary care hospital in China, from January 2011 to April 2017, with the aim to explain the clinical features of active tuberculosis after kidney transplantation and explore the correlated factors for diagnostic delay and mortality. It included 48 cases. All these cases were followed up for at least 12 months after anti-tuberculosis therapy, except the ones who died during this period. The median time of transplantation to active tuberculosis of these 48 patients was about 5.4 years. The time from a first hospital visit to the diagnosis (diagnostic delay) of 12 (25%) cases was more than 30 days. The correlated factors for the diagnostic delay more than 30 days were a fever for more than 2 weeks and antibiotic use for more than 2 weeks. Nine (18.8%) cases died during the anti-tuberculosis therapy or following-up period due to TB relapse. The risk factors for mortality were severe complications, such as encephaledema, severe pneumonia, intestinal perforation, liver function failure, and the following multiple-organ failure. In conclusion, the possibility of tuberculosis infection should be carefully assessed and sometimes diagnostic anti-tuberculosis therapy may be required for patients who had a fever for more than 2 weeks or used antibiotics for more than 2 weeks after kidney transplantation. Severe complications and the following multiple-organ failure might increase the mortality among these patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195695</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ea1aa012</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wu, Meifang Yang, Min Xu, Cheng Ding, Yongtao Li, Kaijin Xu, Jifang Shen, Lanjuan Li&lt;/p&gt;

Decision-making is usually accompanied by metacognition, through which a decision maker monitors uncertainty regarding a decision and may then consequently revise the decision. These decisional metacognitive processes can occur prior to or in the absence of feedback. However, the neural mechanisms of metacognition remain controversial. One theory proposes an independent neural system for metacognition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); the other, that metacognitive processes coincide and overlap with the systems used for the decision-making process per se. In this study, we devised a novel “decision–redecision” paradigm to investigate the neural metacognitive processes involved in redecision as compared to the initial decision-making process. The participants underwent a perceptual decision-making task and a rule-based decision-making task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that the anterior PFC, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), were more extensively activated after the initial decision. The dACC activity in redecision positively scaled with decisional uncertainty and correlated with individual metacognitive uncertainty monitoring abilities—commonly occurring in both tasks—indicating that the dACC was specifically involved in decision uncertainty monitoring. In contrast, the lFPC activity seen in redecision processing was scaled with decision uncertainty reduction and correlated with individual accuracy changes—positively in the rule-based decision-making task and negatively in the perceptual decision-making task. Our results show that the lFPC was specifically involved in metacognitive control of decision adjustment and was subject to different control demands of the tasks. Therefore, our findings support that a separate neural system in the PFC is essentially involved in metacognition and further, that functions of the PFC in metacognition are dissociable.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UPQeF4yIjs0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lirong Qiu, Jie Su, Yinmei Ni, Yang Bai, Xuesong Zhang, Xiaoli Li, Xiaohong Wan&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, our findings support that a separate neural system in the PFC is essentially involved in metacognition and further, that functions of the PFC in metacognition are dissociable.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UPQeF4yIjs0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>73637f96</fingerprint><recrawled>1524507070083</recrawled><crawled>1524506647314</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><title>The neural system of metacognition accompanying decision-making in the prefrontal cortex</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004037</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/UPQeF4yIjs0/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Lirong Qiu</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524517200000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f3ad5b12:38e8b1:76251cdd</id><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004037</link><published>1524517200000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23739-y</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis of DNAs associated with coconut foliar decay disease implicates a unique single-stranded DNA virus representing a new taxon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of DNAs associated with coconut foliar decay disease implicates a unique single-stranded DNA virus representing a new taxon, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23739-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23739-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Analysis of DNAs associated with coconut foliar decay disease implicates a unique single-stranded DNA virus representing a new taxon&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RNKrTl0Ui_w&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis of DNAs associated with coconut foliar decay disease implicates a unique single-stranded DNA virus representing a new taxon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of DNAs associated with coconut foliar decay disease implicates a unique single-stranded DNA virus representing a new taxon, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23739-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23739-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Analysis of DNAs associated with coconut foliar decay disease implicates a unique single-stranded DNA virus representing a new taxon&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RNKrTl0Ui_w&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23739-y/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23739_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>641</width></visual><crawled>1523265642650</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6a6d975f</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23739-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/RNKrTl0Ui_w/s41598-018-23739-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Bruno Gronenborn</name></author><title>Analysis of DNAs associated with coconut foliar decay disease implicates a unique single-stranded DNA virus representing a new taxon</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162a9b5209a:142c876:7c9981b6</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23739-y</link><published>1523257200000</published></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3332.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Gene amplification has been observed in many bacteria and eukaryotes as a response to various selective pressures, such as antibiotics, cytotoxic drugs, pesticides, herbicides, and other stressful environmental conditions.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195336</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fd6c6806</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

However, Cas9-assisted epitope tagging in primary mammalian cell cultures is often inefficient and reliant on plasmid-based selection strategies. Here we demonstrate improved knock-in efficiencies of diverse tags (V5, 3XFLAG, Myc, HA) using co-delivery of Cas9 protein pre-complexed with two-part synthetic modified RNAs (annealed crRNA:tracrRNA) and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) repair templates. Knock-in efficiencies of ~5-30%, were achieved without selection in embryonic stem (ES) cells, neural stem (NS) cells, and brain tumour-derived stem cells. Biallelic-tagged clonal lines were readily derived and used to define Olig2 chromatin-bound interacting partners. Using our novel web-based design tool, we established a 96-well format pipeline that enabled V5-tagging of 60 different transcription factors. This efficient, selection-free and scalable epitope tagging pipeline enables systematic surveys of protein expression levels, subcellular localization, and interactors across diverse mammalian stem cells.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35069</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>steven.pollard@ed.ac.uk (Alex von Kriegsheim)</name></author><title>An efficient and scalable pipeline for epitope tagging in mammalian stem cells using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein</title><unread>True</unread><published>1523404800000</published><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><engagement>5</engagement><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162b48b626e:5145d3:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35069</link><summary><content>CRISPR/Cas9 can be used for precise genetic knock-in of epitope tags into endogenous genes, simplifying experimental analysis of protein function.

Biallelic-tagged clonal lines were readily derived and used to define Olig2 chromatin-bound interacting partners. Using our novel web-based design tool, we established a 96-well format pipeline that enabled V5-tagging of 60 different transcription factors. This efficient, selection-free and scalable epitope tagging pipeline enables systematic surveys of protein expression levels, subcellular localization, and interactors across diverse mammalian stem cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196069</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Amiryousefi, Jaakko Hyvönen, Péter Poczai&lt;/p&gt;
Bittersweet (&lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&lt;/i&gt;) is a native Old World member of the nightshade family. This European diploid species can be found from marshlands to high mountainous regions and it is a common weed that serves as an alternative host and source of resistance genes against plant pathogens such as late blight (&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt;). We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of bittersweet, which is 155,580 bp in length and it is characterized by a typical quadripartite structure composed of a large (85,901 bp) and small (18,449 bp) single-copy region interspersed by two identical inverted repeats (25,615 bp). It consists of 112 unique genes from which 81 are protein-coding, 27 tRNA and four rRNA genes. All bittersweet plastid genes including non-functional ones and even intergenic spacer regions are transcribed in primary plastid transcripts covering 95.22% of the genome. These are later substantially edited in a post-transcriptional phase to activate gene functions. By comparing the bittersweet plastid genome with all available Solanaceae sequences we found that gene content and synteny are highly conserved across the family. During genome comparison we have identified several annotation errors, which we have corrected in a manual curation process then we have identified the major plastid genome structural changes in Solanaceae. Interpreted in a phylogenetic context they seem to provide additional support for larger clades. The plastid genome sequence of bittersweet could help to benchmark Solanaceae plastid genome annotations and could be used as a reference for further studies. Such reliable annotations are important for gene diversity calculations, synteny map constructions and assigning partitions for phylogenetic analysis with de novo sequenced plastomes of Solanaceae.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196069</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>aa621f38</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Amiryousefi, Jaakko Hyvönen, Péter Poczai&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, entrepreneurship has been gaining more prominence as a potential tool for solving poverty in developing countries. This paper mainly examines the relationship between farmer entrepreneurship and rural poverty alleviation in China by assessing the contribution of farm entrepreneurs towards overcoming poverty. Data were collected from 309 employees of farmer entrepreneurships in Guangxi Province through survey questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct an analysis of the effects of three identified capabilities of farm entrepreneurs—economic, educational and knowledge, and socio-cultural capabilities—on attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth and the qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship and how these in turn affect rural poverty, using AMOS 21. The findings show that socio-cultural capability has the greatest influence on farmer entrepreneurship growth (β = 0.50, p&amp;lt;0.001). The qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship also more significantly impacts rural poverty (β = 0.69, p&amp;lt;0.001) than attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth. This study suggests that policy makers in China should involve more rural farmers in the targeted poverty alleviation strategies of the government by equipping rural farmers with entrepreneurial skills. This can serve as a sustainable, bottom-up approach to alleviating rural poverty in remote areas of the country. The study also extends the literature on the farmer entrepreneurship-rural poverty alleviation nexus in China, and this can serve as a lesson for other developing countries in the fight against rural poverty.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194912</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fb35b522</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Yaw Naminse, Jincai Zhuang&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to administer a Delphi panel survey and provide evidence for the development of a psychological intervention protocol for use after disasters in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A three-round Delphi survey was conducted. In all rounds, respondents answered open- or closed-ended questions regarding their views on i) the concept of disaster, ii) evaluation, iii) intervention, and iv) considerations in a disaster. Data from Round 1 were subjected to content analysis. In Round 2, items with content validity ratios (CVRs) greater than 0.49 were included, and in Round 3, items with a CVR≥0.38 were accepted.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The response rates for the Delphi survey were high: 83% (n = 15, Round 1), 80% (n = 16, Round 2), and 86% (n = 24, Round 3). The data collected during this survey showed a need for a support system for children; for preventive strategies, including disaster readiness plans; for the protection of children&apos;s safety; and for the development of post-disaster psychosocial care.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The panel experts reached a consensus regarding the steps they considered critical in post-disaster evaluation and intervention.

Age estimation methods based on hard structures require a process of validation to confirm the periodical pattern of growth marks. Among such processes, one of the most used is the marginal increment ratio (MIR), which was stated to follow a sinusoidal cycle in a population. Despite its utility, in most cases, its implementation has lacked robust statistical analysis. Accordingly, we propose a modeling approach for the temporal periodicity of growth increments based on single and second order harmonic functions. For illustrative purposes, the MIR periodicities for two geoduck species (&lt;i&gt;Panopea generosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Panopea globosa&lt;/i&gt;) were modeled to identify the periodical pattern of growth increments in the shell. This model identified an annual periodicity for both species but described different temporal patterns. The proposed procedure can be broadly used to objectively define the timing of the peak, the degree of symmetry, and therefore, the synchrony of band deposition of different species on the basis of MIR data.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196189</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>943470de</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by José Angel Hidalgo-de-la-Toba, Enrique Morales-Bojórquez, Sergio Scarry González-Peláez, J.

Recent vaccine studies with experimental antigens have shown that regulatory T cells (Tregs) constrain the magnitude of B cell responses. This homeostatic Treg-mediated suppression is thought to reduce the potential of germinal center (GC) responses to generate autoreactive antibodies. However, essentially opposite results were observed in live influenza infections where Tregs promoted B cell and antibody responses. Thus, it remains unclear whether Tregs dampen or enhance B cell responses, especially during live viral infections. Here, we use mice infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), which induces a robust expansion of Tregs. Depletion of Tregs led to elevated activation, proliferation, and class switching of B cells. In addition, Treg depletion enhanced the production of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies and reduced FV viremia. Thus, in contrast to influenza infection, Tregs either directly or indirectly suppress B cells during mouse retroviral infection indicating that the ultimate effect of Tregs on B cell responses is specific to the particular infectious agent.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195402</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a8213765</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tyler C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a live, viral vaccine under advanced development as a non-replicating smallpox vaccine. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted to demonstrate the humoral immunogenic equivalence of three consecutively manufactured MVA production lots, and to confirm the safety and tolerability of MVA focusing on cardiac readouts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The trial was conducted at 34 sites in the US. Vaccinia-naïve adults aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups using a 1:1:1:1 randomization scheme. Subjects received either two MVA injections from three consecutive lots (Groups 1-3), or two placebo injections (Group 4), four weeks apart. Everyone except personnel involved in vaccine handling and administration was blinded to treatment. Safety assessment focused on cardiac monitoring throughout the trial. Vaccinia-specific antibody titers were measured using a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The primary immunogenicity endpoint was Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after two MVA vaccinations measured by PRNT at trial visit 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01144637.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 2013 and May 2014, 4005 subjects were enrolled and received at least one injection of MVA (n = 3003) or placebo (n = 1002). The three MVA lots induced equivalent antibody titers two weeks after the second vaccination, with seroconversion rates of 99·8% (PRNT) and 99·7% (ELISA). Overall, 180 (6·0%) subjects receiving MVA and 29 (2·9%) subjects in the placebo group reported at least one unsolicited Adverse Event (AE) that was considered trial-related. Vaccination was well tolerated without significant safety concerns, particularly regarding cardiac assessment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The neutralizing and total antibody titers induced by each of the three lots were equivalent. No significant safety concerns emerged in this healthy trial population, especially regarding cardiac safety, thus confirming the excellent safety and tolerability profile of MVA.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01144637&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195897</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>49f44515</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edgar Turner Overton, Steven J.

That, put simply, is a different crystalline form, and any given substance can have several. Or a lot more than several. I don’t know what the record is for any single compound, but it’s way up into the dozens, and you never know when a new one might show up. You can get these different forms through all sorts of variations in the way the compound is crystallized or precipitated: different solvents, different temperatures, different types of stirring (yes indeed), different concentrations. . .and we haven’t even gotten to hydrates and solvates, where molecules of water or other solvents are incorporated into the crystal structure as it forms. And &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; can have polymorphs in turn, or different ratios of water and solvent, and there’s just no end to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphs can behave completely differently from each other. The same substance, completely pure, can come out looking like several unmistakable crystal types (rods, prisms, plates), in different crystalline space groups, with completely different melting points and solubility behavior. Past blog posts on this are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/10/22/phenylalanine_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/08/25/polymorphs_and_salts_india_raises_an_eyebrow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2011/01/12/gassing_your_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/01/novartis_loses_the_glivec_patent_fight_in_india&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and as that last one illustrates, this is definitely not something of just theoretical interest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=17333&quot;&gt;The saga&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-HIV drug Ritonavir is the classic example. That altered solubility behavior is of tremendous importance for drug dosing, and in Ritonavir’s case, a more stable (and less desirable!) polymorph appeared and threatened to disrupt the entire supply of the drug, because after a while, it was appearing more and more in the production line. “More stable”, of course, can easily mean “so stable it would rather not dissolve and get into the bloodstream”. Polymorphs themselves can be patented separately over such meaningful differences, as can methods for their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even very simple compounds can show grindingly complex behavior. Aspirin, for example, exists in two polymorphs (so far) that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.200603373&quot;&gt;so similar&lt;/a&gt; that they can both show up &lt;em&gt;in the same single crystal&lt;/em&gt;, and it takes good X-ray data (and a good X-ray crystallographer) to work out what’s going on. One of those past blog post links is about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/blog/post-42/&quot;&gt;trickiness of phenylalanine&lt;/a&gt;, a substance you’d think had been studied to pieces by now. But as that link shows, D-ribose is in the same category: the crystallographic literature for years was all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about something even more simple than those? I refer to the most simple amino acid of all, glycine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.201800741&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has some details on its polymorphs, and the ridiculously subtle effects that cause them to form. There are three that form under “normal” conditions from aqueous solution, and while the gamma one is the most thermodynamically stable, the alpha one is kinetically favored. Adding small amounts of simple alcohols to the aqueous solution starts producing mixtures of the alpha and beta forms, though, and eventually, as the alcohol concentration goes up, you only get the beta form. All classic polymorph behavior. But why? Here’s what the authors found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Herein,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;applying&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;extremely&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;sensitive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;pyroelectric &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;measurements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;impedance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;different &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;temperatures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;discovered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;methanol,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;unlike&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;water,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;incorporated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;polar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;within&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;bulk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;growing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-polymorph.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Consequently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;solvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;molecules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;create &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;polar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;domains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;exhibit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;pyroelectricity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(i.e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;develop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;temporary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;voltage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;exposed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;temperature &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;changes). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;result,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;follows&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;incorporated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;solvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;molecules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;operate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;conventional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“tailor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-made” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;inhibitors &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;polymorph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the alpha-form starts growing in a pyramidal shape, just as it usually does, but then starts incorporating methanol-solvated glycine molecules into its growing lattice. This buries methanol molecules into the crystal as it continues forming, and creates zones of higher polarity because of the different orientation of those solvated glycines (and the slight deformations in the nearest neighbor glycine arrangements as well). The normal arrangement in the crystal is a sort of “canceled-out” glycine dimer, but that gets disrupted into a more polarizable form. That’s the origin of the pyroelectric effect they’re able to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this starts happening, that developing surface of the crystal ends up “poisoned”, as some molecular dynamic simulations suggest, by the methanols incorporated into the lattice. The new surface doesn’t recognize the usual glycine-dimer form so readily, and further growth is inhibited – you see truncated pyramids of the alpha-form that have stopped in their tracks. Meanwhile, the beta-form end up with one surface (a more hydrophilic one) similarly poisoned and inhibited, but another one (a more hydrophobic one) is totally unaffected, so the crystal grows more rapidly along that face and produces long rods of the beta-form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of detail answers some questions and raises others. There are probably all sorts of metastable crystal forms (and crystal surfaces) showing up in complex polymorph situations, and the ability to see and characterize these things will (as in this case) give us a better physical picture of what’s going on. But predicting such behavior is another thing entirely. You’d hope as we start to pile up enough detail that predictive power will start to emerge (hello, machine learning). That’s a reasonable hope, but there’s no reason that things have to work out that way. The whole “Big Data” effort across various sciences is putting that view of the world to the test, and sometimes it’s going to work out and sometimes it isn’t.

Large marine protected areas (LMPAs) are increasingly being established and have a high profile in marine conservation. LMPAs are expected to achieve multiple objectives, and because of their size are postulated to avoid trade-offs that are common in smaller MPAs. However, evaluations across multiple outcomes are lacking. We used a systematic approach to code several social and ecological outcomes of 12 LMPAs. We found evidence of three types of trade-offs: trade-offs between different ecological resources (supply trade-offs); trade-offs between ecological resource conditions and the well-being of resource users (supply-demand trade-offs); and trade-offs between the well-being outcomes of different resource users (demand trade-offs). We also found several divergent outcomes that were attributed to influences beyond the scope of the LMPA. We suggest that despite their size, trade-offs can develop in LMPAs and should be considered in planning and design. LMPAs may improve their performance across multiple social and ecological objectives if integrated with larger-scale conservation efforts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195760</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524073508287</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3e3f34f7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tammy E.

To ensure optimal calcium accrual in the fetal skeleton, a substantial rise occurs in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D), but is dependent on sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D). Large longitudinal studies addressing free 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D during pregnancy are scarce. We aimed to assess levels of and relationship between 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and free 25(OH)D during pregnancy; determinants of vitamin D status; and association between vitamin D indices or PTH and pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes mellitus and birthweight). Altogether 855 pregnant Norwegian Caucasian women from Trondheim and Stavanger (latitude 63°N and 58°N) were recruited; 94 were lost to follow-up. The study was originally a randomized controlled trial (2007–2009) with gestational diabetes as primary outcome. Data were collected in second and third trimester. In third trimester, 246 (34%) had vitamin D insufficiency and 52 (7%) deficiency (25(OH)D &amp;lt;50 and &amp;lt;30nmol/L, respectively). During wintertime in third trimester, 61 (47%) from Trondheim and 23 (51%) from Stavanger exhibited vitamin D insufficiency. PTH was elevated in 27 (3.7%). Estimate of change between trimesters was (95% CI): 25(OH)D -1.8 (-2.8 to -0.7) nmol/L, DBP 0.62 (0.57 to 0.66) μmol/L, calculated free 25(OH)D -1.7 (-2.0 to -1.4) pmol/L, PTH 0.81 (0.72 to 0.90) pmol/L, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D (sub-analysis) 31.4 (CI 24.7 to 38.2) pmol/L. A decrease in 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D occurred in 45% of those with vitamin D deficiency, and they also exhibited lower levels than women with adequate vitamin D status. No association of vitamin D indices and PTH with pregnancy outcomes was observed. Women in Trondheim displayed lower 25(OH)D levels, despite minor latitudinal differences. Less than one-fifth adhered to the authorities’ vitamin D recommendations. These findings demonstrate that hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among pregnant women living in northern latitudes, especially during the dark season, and there is an unmet need to ensure adequate vitamin D intake.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195041</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3f1ae0fd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miriam K.

Ageing is associated with grey matter atrophy and changes in task-related neural activations. This study investigated the effects of age and education on neural activation during a spatial working memory task in 189 participants aged between 20–80 years old, whilst controlling for grey matter density. Age was related to linear decreases in neural activation in task activated areas, and this effect was no longer significant when adjusting for education or accuracy. Age was also related to cubic increases in neural activation in non-task related areas, such as the temporal gyrus, cuneus and cerebellum when adjusting for accuracy and education. These findings support previous lifespan datasets indicating linear age-related decreases in task activation, but non-linear increases in non-task related areas during episodic memory tasks. The findings also support past studies indicating education offers a form of cognitive reserve through providing a form of neural compensation and highlights the need to consider education in ageing studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194878</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8b6fabff</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jo A.

Background &lt;p&gt;South Africa has a high burden of MDR-TB, and to provide accessible treatment the government has introduced different models of care. We report the most cost-effective model after comparing cost per patient successfully treated across 5 models of care: centralized hospital, district hospitals (2), and community-based care through clinics or mobile injection teams.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In an observational study five cohorts were followed prospectively. The cost analysis adopted a provider perspective and economic cost per patient successfully treated was calculated based on country protocols and length of treatment per patient per model of care. Logistic regression was used to calculate propensity score weights, to compare pairs of treatment groups, whilst adjusting for baseline imbalances between groups. Propensity score weighted costs and treatment success rates were used in the ICER analysis. Sensitivity analysis focused on varying treatment success and length of hospitalization within each model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 1,038 MDR-TB patients 75% were HIV-infected and 56% were successfully treated. The cost per successfully treated patient was 3 to 4.5 times lower in the community-based models with no hospitalization.

molecular adsorption is more stable at higher coverages. The adsorption energy
is stronger at the oxygen defective interfaces which arises from the high

Recent comparative genomics studies have suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the major processes in bacterial evolution. In this study, HGT events of 64 &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; strains were investigated based on the pipeline employed in HGTree database constructed in our recent study. Tree reconciliation method was applied in order to calculate feasible HGT events. Following initial detection and an evaluation procedure, evidence of the HGT was identified in 548 gene families including 42 gene families transferred from outside of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydiae&lt;/i&gt; phylum with high reliability. The donor species of inter-phylum HGT consists of 12 different bacterial and archaeal phyla, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; might have even more various host range than in previous reports. In addition, each species of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; showed varying preference towards HGT, and genes engaged in HGT within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; and between other species showed different functional distribution. Also, examination of individual gene flows of niche-specific genes suggested that many of such genes are transferred mainly within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genus. Our results uncovered novel features of HGT acting on &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genome evolution, and it would be also strong evidence that HGT is an ongoing process for intracellular pathogens. We expect that the results provide more insight into lineage- and niche-specific adaptations regarding their infectivity and pathogenicity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195139</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f9fcd9df</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyaekang Kim, Woori Kwak, Sook Hee Yoon, Dae-Kyung Kang, Heebal Kim&lt;/p&gt;

We showed that the new algorithm&apos;s computational complexity scales with the number of active particles in the simulated system, and is able to outperform the well‐established Particle Particle Particle Mesh (P3M) for adaptively restrained simulations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1458?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1458.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a57f8d54</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1458?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Collins, J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Low birth weight infant (LBWIs) are prone to mental and behavioural problems. As an important constituent of the brain and retina, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential for foetal infant mental and visual development. The effect of lactation supplemented with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) on the improvement of intelligence in low birth weight children requires further validation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this study, a comprehensive search of multiple databases was performed to identify studies focused the association between intelligence and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in LBWIs. Studies that compared the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) or the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence for Children (WISC) scores between LBWIs who were supplemented and controls that were not supplemented with LCPUFA during lactation were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The main outcome was the mean difference in the mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) of the BSID and the full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) of the WISC between LBWIs and controls. Our findings indicated that the mean BSID or WISC scores in LBWIs did not differ between the supplemented groups and controls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This meta-analysis does not reveal that LCPUFA supplementation has a significant impact on the level of intelligence in LBWIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195662</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>31d817c9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Song, Ya Liu, Yun Pan, Xiaofeng Yuan, Pengyu Chang, Yuan Tian, Weiwei Cui, Dong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;To examine the accuracy of Rapid Diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;Talaromyces marneffei&lt;/i&gt; (RDTM) in order to improve diagnosis and treatment for clinical measures and reduce the mortality due to associated infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we screened PubMed, Ovid (Cochrane library) and Web of Science, Chinese database CNKI and Wanfang for articles published between 1956 and December, 2017. Data were taken from cross-sectional studies as well as from baseline measurements in longitudinal studies with clinical follow-up. Articles were excluded if they did not contain a cohort with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; and a control cohort or a cohort with standard fungus culture.

Background &lt;p&gt;Body fatness is associated with risk of coronary heart disease and it has been postulated that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) may have a particularly detrimental effect because of its localized toxic effects. We therefore aimed to examine the association between EAT and coronary artery calcification and compared this with associations for visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and other regional fat depots.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study of 487 Chinese participants aged 50 years old and above, living in Singapore. Participants, free from known diabetes mellitus and coronary heart diseases, completed interviews, a health screening to evaluate obesity and cardiovascular disease risk factors, and computed tomography scans of the abdomen and coronary arteries. Associations between regional fat depots and subclinical atherosclerosis defined as CAC&gt; = 100 were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) was highly correlated with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (Pearson r = 0.72) and trunk fat mass (r = 0.66). The age and sex-adjusted odd ratio (OR) (in 1-SD increase) of subclinical atherosclerosis was 1.28 (1.01–1.61) for EAT and 1.40 (1.04–1.88) for VAT.

Neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are apicobasally elongated and densely packed in the developing brain, systematically move their nuclei/somata in a cell cycle–dependent manner, called interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM): apical during G2 and basal during G1. Although intracellular molecular mechanisms of individual IKNM have been explored, how heterogeneous IKNMs are collectively coordinated is unknown. Our quantitative cell-biological and in silico analyses revealed that tissue elasticity mechanically assists an initial step of basalward IKNM. When the soma of an M-phase progenitor cell rounds up using actomyosin within the subapical space, a microzone within 10 μm from the surface, which is compressed and elastic because of the apical surface’s contractility, laterally pushes the densely neighboring processes of non–M-phase cells. The pressed processes then recoil centripetally and basally to propel the nuclei/somata of the progenitor’s daughter cells. Thus, indirect neighbor-assisted transfer of mechanical energy from mother to daughter helps efficient brain development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QIHSf4hXHfg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoyasu Shinoda, Arata Nagasaka, Yasuhiro Inoue, Ryo Higuchi, Yoshiaki Minami, Kagayaki Kato, Makoto Suzuki, Takefumi Kondo, Takumi Kawaue, Kanako Saito, Naoto Ueno, Yugo Fukazawa, Masaharu Nagayama, Takashi Miura, Taiji Adachi, Takaki Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithms.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XJmM-iMvR90&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael F.

Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex.

The relationship between ABO blood groups (BG) and risk of incidence in cancers including gynecological cancers has been widely studied, showing increased incidence risk for BG A patients. As available data are inconsistent we investigated whether BG and their anti-glycan antibodies (anti-A and anti-B) have prognostic values in gynecological cancers. We retrospectively evaluated 974 patients with gynecological cancers in three cancer centers (Switzerland and Australia) between 1974 and 2014 regarding the relationships between clinico-pathological findings and the BG. Time to disease recurrence was significantly influenced by BG in patients with ovarian (n = 282) and vulvar (n = 67) cancer. BG O or B patients showed a significantly increased risk for ovarian cancer relapse compared to A, 59% and 82%, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.045; HR O vs A = 1.59 (CI 1.01–2.51) and (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036; HR A vs B = 0.55 (CI 0.32–0.96). Median time to relapse for advanced stage (n = 126) ovarian cancer patients was 18.2 months for BG O and 32.2 for A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031; HR O vs A = 2.07 (CI 1.07–4.02)). BG also significantly influenced relapse-free survival in patients with vulvar cancer (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), with BG O tending to have increased relapse risk compared to A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.089). Blood groups hence associate with recurrence in ovarian and vulvar cancer: women with BG O seem to have a lower ovarian cancer incidence, however are more likely to relapse earlier. The significance of the BG status as a prognostic value is evident and may be helpful to oncologists in prognosticating disease outcome and selecting the appropriate therapy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>985d93ea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Céline Montavon Sartorius, Andreas Schoetzau, Henriette Kettelhack, Daniel Fink, Neville F.

Median time to relapse for advanced stage (n = 126) ovarian cancer patients was 18.2 months for BG O and 32.2 for A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031; HR O vs A = 2.07 (CI 1.07–4.02)). BG also significantly influenced relapse-free survival in patients with vulvar cancer (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), with BG O tending to have increased relapse risk compared to A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.089). Blood groups hence associate with recurrence in ovarian and vulvar cancer: women with BG O seem to have a lower ovarian cancer incidence, however are more likely to relapse earlier. The significance of the BG status as a prognostic value is evident and may be helpful to oncologists in prognosticating disease outcome and selecting the appropriate therapy.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Céline Montavon Sartorius</name></author><title>ABO blood groups as a prognostic factor for recurrence in ovarian and vulvar cancer</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde28:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</link><published>1522357200000</published></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31835</originId><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31835</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524553304389</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>826ce589</fingerprint><description>As species face rapid environmental change, we can build resilient populations through restoration projects that incorporate predicted future climates into seed sourcing decisions. &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus melliodora&lt;/i&gt; is a foundation species of a critically endangered community in Australia that is a target for restoration.

Inertial sensors offer the potential for integration into wireless virtual reality systems that allow the users to walk freely through virtual environments. However, owing to drift errors, inertial sensors cannot accurately estimate head and body orientations in the long run, and when walking indoors, this error cannot be corrected by magnetometers, due to the magnetic field distortion created by ferromagnetic materials present in buildings. This paper proposes a technique, called EHBD (Equalization of Head and Body Directions), to address this problem using two head- and shoulder-located magnetometers. Due to their proximity, their distortions are assumed to be similar and the magnetometer measurements are used to detect when the user is looking straight forward. Then, the system corrects the discrepancies between the estimated directions of the head and the shoulder, which are provided by gyroscopes and consequently are affected by drift errors. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of this technique in two tasks (navigation and navigation plus exploration) and using two different locomotion techniques: (1) gaze-directed mode (GD) in which the walking direction is forced to be the same as the head direction, and (2) decoupled direction mode (DD) in which the walking direction can be different from the viewing direction.

Inertial sensors offer the potential for integration into wireless virtual reality systems that allow the users to walk freely through virtual environments. However, owing to drift errors, inertial sensors cannot accurately estimate head and body orientations in the long run, and when walking indoors, this error cannot be corrected by magnetometers, due to the magnetic field distortion created by ferromagnetic materials present in buildings. This paper proposes a technique, called EHBD (Equalization of Head and Body Directions), to address this problem using two head- and shoulder-located magnetometers. Due to their proximity, their distortions are assumed to be similar and the magnetometer measurements are used to detect when the user is looking straight forward. Then, the system corrects the discrepancies between the estimated directions of the head and the shoulder, which are provided by gyroscopes and consequently are affected by drift errors. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of this technique in two tasks (navigation and navigation plus exploration) and using two different locomotion techniques: (1) gaze-directed mode (GD) in which the walking direction is forced to be the same as the head direction, and (2) decoupled direction mode (DD) in which the walking direction can be different from the viewing direction. The obtained results show that both locomotion modes show similar matching of the target path during the navigation task, while DD’s path matches the target path more closely than GD in the navigation plus exploration task. These results validate the EHBD technique especially when allowing different walking and viewing directions in the navigation plus exploration tasks, as expected. While the proposed method does not reach the accuracy of optical tracking (ideal case), it is an acceptable and satisfactory solution for users and is much more compact, portable and economical.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195191</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ernesto de la Rubia</name></author><title>Natural locomotion based on a reduced set of inertial sensors: Decoupling body and head directions indoors</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4601:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195191</link><published>1522962000000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/eaaq1392?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;True physiological imaging of subcellular dynamics requires studying cells within their parent organisms, where all the environmental cues that drive gene expression, and hence the phenotypes that we actually observe, are present.

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schröder, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

Terrestrial arthropods play an important role in saltmarsh ecosystems, mainly affecting the saltmarsh’s primary production as the main consumers of terrestrial primary production and decomposition. Some of these arthropods, including selected insects and spiders, can be used as ecological indicators of overall marsh environmental health, as they are differentially sensitive to ecological stressors, such as land loss, erosion, oil spills, and tropical storms. In the present study, we used terrestrial arthropods collected from seven (three lightly-oiled, four heavily-oiled) sites in Barataria Bay and from three unoiled reference sites in Delacroix, Louisiana, to determine the impacts of the distribution and re-distribution of &lt;i&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/i&gt; (DWH) oil on these saltmarsh ecosystems. A total of 9,476 and 12,256 insects were collected in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The results show that the terrestrial arthropods were negatively affected by the re-distribution of DWH oil by Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although the level of impacts varied among the arthropod groups. Moreover, the mean diversity index was higher (&gt;1.5) in 2014 than in 2013 (&amp;lt;1.5) for all sites, suggesting a recovery trajectory of the saltmarsh arthropod population. The higher taxonomic richness observed in the reference sites compared to the oiled sites for both years also indicated long-term impacts of DWH oil to the saltmarsh arthropod community. Whereas a slow recovery of certain terrestrial arthropods was observed, long-term monitoring of arthropod communities would help better understand the recovery and succession of the marsh ecosystems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194941</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>24bf6159</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wokil Bam, Linda M.

The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Kaiser, Sebastian Bittrich, Sebastian Salentin, Christoph Leberecht, V.

Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>545f066f</fingerprint><recrawled>1523911321731</recrawled><crawled>1523900893385</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><title>Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers delineate Class I and Class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006101</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZqNwxiUByA0/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Florian Kaiser</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>8</engagement><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d3:bdf8aaf1</id><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006101</link><published>1523912400000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00290</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00290/20180420/images/medium/bi-2018-002905_0002.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00290&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

A suitable irrigation method adopted to arid desert conditions, including a special soil structure and specialized plants, has been continuously studied and improved. A field study was conducted in the Awei irrigation area of Aletai in Xinjiang in 2015 and 2016 to investigate the applicability of shallow subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) in an arid desert area. A completely randomized block design with three replications and three treatments for drip tape subsurface depths at 5, 10, 20 cm was established. The results indicated that the vertical distribution of the soil moisture of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI, buried depth at 20 cm) was mainly concentrated at 0–60 cm, while SSDI (buried depth at 5 and 10 cm) was concentrated at 0–30 cm. However, the roots distributions were concentrated at 0–30 cm for SDI and SSDI. The chlorophyll content and water consumption intensity for alfalfa first increased and then decreased in arid desert conditions. The dry yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of SSDI (buried depth at 10 cm) were higher than those of SDI. The SSDI was practical in arid desert conditions and the recommended buried depth was 10 cm.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195965</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2af7be7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shufang Wang, Xiyun Jiao, Weihua Guo, Jian Lu, Yungang Bai, Liping Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Metabolic engineering focuses on rewriting the metabolism of cells to enhance native products or endow cells with the ability to produce new products. This engineering has the potential for wide-range application, including the production of fuels, chemicals, foods and pharmaceuticals. Glycolysis manages the levels of various secondary metabolites by controlling the supply of glycolytic metabolites. Metabolic reprogramming of glycolysis is expected to cause an increase in the secondary metabolites of interest. In this study, we constructed a budding yeast strain harboring the combination of triple sirtuin gene deletion (&lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆) and interruption of gluconeogenesis by the deletion of the &lt;i&gt;FBP1&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (&lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆). &lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆ cells harbored active glycolysis with high glucose consumption and active ethanol productivity. Using capillary electrophoresis–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE–TOF/MS) analysis, &lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆ cells accumulated not only glycolytic metabolites but also secondary metabolites, including nucleotides that were synthesized throughout the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, although various amino acids remained at low levels.

Anti-drug antibody formation occurs with most biological agents across disease states, but the mechanism by which they are formed is unknown. The formation of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab (AAA) may decrease its therapeutic effects in some patients. HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with autoantibody formation against interferons and other TNF inhibitors, but not adalimumab. We analyzed samples from 634 subjects with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS): 37 subjects (17 RA and 20 HS) developed AAA (AAA+) during adalimumab treatment and 597 subjects (348 RA, 249 HS) did not develop AAA (AAA-) during the clinical trials. Using next-generation sequencing-based HLA typing, we identified three protective HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1*05, HLA-DRB1*01,and HLA-DRB1*07) that were less prevalent in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 0.4, 0.25 and 0.28, respectively; and P values: 0.012, 0.012 and 0.018, respectively) and two risk HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*011) that were more abundant in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 2.52, and 2.64, respectively; and P values: 0.006 and 0.019). Similar to the finding of Billiet &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. who found that carriage of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was more prevalent in those with anti-infliximab antibodies (OR = 3.6, p = 0.002, 95% CI: [1.5,8.6]).), we found HLA-DRB1*03 allele was also more prevalent in anti-adalimumab positive (OR = 2.52, p = 0.006, 95% CI: [1.37,4.63]). The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195325</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e08b35e8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohan Liu, Jacob Degner, Justin Wade Davis, Kenneth B.

Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms play a pivotal role in the regulation of numerous cellular functions, making them extensively studied and highly attractive drug targets. Utilizing the crystal structure of the PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; C1B domain, we have developed hydrophobic isophthalic acid derivatives that modify PKC functions by binding to the C1 domain of the enzyme. In the present study, we aimed to improve the drug-like properties of the isophthalic acid derivatives by increasing their solubility and enhancing the binding affinity. Here we describe the design and synthesis of a series of multisubstituted pyrimidines as analogs of C1 domain–targeted isophthalates and characterize their binding affinities to the PKC&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; isoform. In contrast to our computational predictions, the scaffold hopping from phenyl to pyrimidine core diminished the binding affinity. Although the novel pyrimidines did not establish improved binding affinity for PKC&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; compared to our previous isophthalic acid derivatives, the present results provide useful structure-activity relationship data for further development of ligands targeted to the C1 domain of PKC.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195668</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cdc7514d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Riccardo Provenzani, Ilari Tarvainen, Giulia Brandoli, Antti Lempinen, Sanna Artes, Ainoleena Turku, Maria Helena Jäntti, Virpi Talman, Jari Yli-Kauhaluoma, Raimo K.

Bdelloid rotifers are a class of microscopic invertebrates that have existed for millions of years apparently without sex or meiosis. They inhabit a variety of temporary and permanent freshwater habitats globally, and many species are remarkably tolerant of desiccation. Bdelloids offer an opportunity to better understand the evolution of sex and recombination, but previous work has emphasised desiccation as the cause of several unusual genomic features in this group. Here, we present high-quality whole-genome sequences of 3 bdelloid species: &lt;i&gt;Rotaria macrura&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magnacalcarata&lt;/i&gt;, which are both desiccation intolerant, and &lt;i&gt;Adineta ricciae&lt;/i&gt;, which is desiccation tolerant. In combination with the published assembly of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaga&lt;/i&gt;, which is also desiccation tolerant, we apply a comparative genomics approach to evaluate the potential effects of desiccation tolerance and asexuality on genome evolution in bdelloids. We find that ancestral tetraploidy is conserved among all 4 bdelloid species, but homologous divergence in obligately aquatic &lt;i&gt;Rotaria&lt;/i&gt; genomes is unexpectedly low. This finding is contrary to current models regarding the role of desiccation in shaping bdelloid genomes. In addition, we find that homologous regions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ricciae&lt;/i&gt; are largely collinear and do not form palindromic repeats as observed in the published &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaga&lt;/i&gt; assembly. Consequently, several features interpreted as genomic evidence for long-term ameiotic evolution are not general to all bdelloid species, even within the same genus. Finally, we substantiate previous findings of high levels of horizontally transferred nonmetazoan genes in both desiccating and nondesiccating bdelloid species and show that this unusual feature is not shared by other animal phyla, even those with desiccation-tolerant representatives. These comparisons call into question the proposed role of desiccation in mediating horizontal genetic transfer.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y70C1gFZUSk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Reuben W.

Unfortunately, so is working with transcriptional data. Genes can be referred to using a multitude of different identifiers and are assigned to an ever increasing number of categories. Gene expression data may be available in a variety of units (e.g, counts, RPKMs, TPMs). Batch effects dominate signal, but metadata may not be available. Most of the tools are written in R.

Unfortunately, so is working with transcriptional data. Genes can be referred to using a multitude of different identifiers and are assigned to an ever increasing number of categories. Gene expression data may be available in a variety of units (e.g, counts, RPKMs, TPMs). Batch effects dominate signal, but metadata may not be available. Most of the tools are written in R.

Mitigating extreme heat in urban areas is beneficial and sometimes critical to human health. Thriving plant communities in community parks play an important role in mitigating extreme heat through providing cooling effect, while inevitably affecting how people perceive the benefits of using community parks for recreation. Thus, the impacts of plant communities on the thermal environment should be quantified to determine the optimal structure of the plant community. The goal would be to harmonize the functions of improving the thermal environment with the preferences people have related to the recreational benefits of plant communities with various levels of vegetation density. In this paper, the correlations between the structural characteristics of plant communities and their function in mitigating the thermal environment were investigated on calm summer days in Xincheng Central Park, Minhang District, Shanghai, China. In addition to analyzing the plant communities present and their effects on the park microclimate, a questionnaire was employed to determine the plant community preferences of recreational park users. The results showed that plant communities could reduce the air temperature by 1.23–2.42 °C and increase the relative humidity by 2.4–4.2% during the daytime. The microclimate conditions in plant communities with varying vegetation densities were significantly different. The canopy density and leaf area index primarily controlled the temperature reduction, while the canopy density and total canopy cover ratio primarily controlled the increase in humidity; meanwhile, these correlations varied at different times of the day. Moreover, most of the park users preferred a moderately dense plant community which met their environmental perceptions for recreation in parks. Age or education level variables of park users would also predict preferences for different plant community densities. Ultimately, one plant community pattern with appropriate canopy density (60%), leaf area index (≥3) and canopy cover ratio (total 0.80–1.20, with 0.6–0.75 for trees and 0.20–0.45 for shrubs/woodland area) was recommended, which would harmonize the functions of the mitigation of the thermal environment with most people’s perception of a desirable vegetation density.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196445</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524679026474</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>abc5b14e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhigang Li, Dan Chen, Shize Cai, Shengquan Che&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To investigate the factors associated with age at natural menopause in a large population of Chinese adult women.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study was part of the baseline survey of China Kadoorie Biobank in Zhejiang Province. A total of 17,076 postmenopausal women were included in the present study. Relevant data of socio-demographic, lifestyle, dietary and reproductive characteristics were collected. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the associated factors of age at natural menopause with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean age at natural menopause was 48.94 years, with 3.40% of the women experienced premature menopause and 6.75% early menopause.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;).

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (&lt;i&gt;Anas acuta&lt;/i&gt;), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195327</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Andrew B.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Bioactive oxidised lipids (oxylipins) are important signalling mediators, capable of modulating the inflammatory state of the joint and anticipated to be of importance in joint homeostasis and status of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to quantify oxylipin levels in plasma and synovial fluid from rats with experimentally induced osteoarthritis to investigate the potential role of oxylipins as a marker in the disease process of early osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Forty rats were randomly allocated to a standard or high-fat diet group. After 12 weeks, local cartilage damage was induced in one knee joint in 14 rats of each diet group. The remaining 6 rats per group served as controls. At week 24, samples were collected. Oxylipin levels were quantified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 31 lipid-derived inflammatory mediators were detected in fasted plasma and synovial fluid. Principal component analysis identified four distinct clusters associated with histopathological changes. Diet induced differences were evident for 13 individual plasma oxylipins, as well as 5,6-EET in synovial fluid. Surgical-model induced differences were evident for three oxylipins in synovial fluid (15-HETE, 8,9-DHET and 17R-ResolvinD1) with a different response in lipid concentrations for synovial fluid and plasma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We demonstrate the quantification of oxidised lipids in rat plasma and synovial fluid in a model of early experimental osteoarthritis. Oxylipins in the synovial fluid that were altered as consequence of the surgically induced osteoarthritis were not represented in the plasma. Our findings suggest differential roles of the oxylipins in the local versus peripheral compartment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196308</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e555ab86</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by H.

Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive nucleotide sequences that make up a large portion of eukaryotic genomes. They can move and duplicate within a genome, increasing genome size and contributing to genetic diversity within and across species. Accurate identification and classification of TEs present in a genome is an important step towards understanding their effects on genes and their role in genome evolution. We introduce TE-Learner, a framework based on machine learning that automatically identifies TEs in a given genome and assigns a classification to them. We present an implementation of our framework towards LTR retrotransposons, a particular type of TEs characterized by having long terminal repeats (LTRs) at their boundaries. We evaluate the predictive performance of our framework on the well-annotated genomes of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and we compare our results for three LTR retrotransposon superfamilies with the results of three widely used methods for TE identification or classification: RepeatMasker, Censor and LtrDigest. In contrast to these methods, TE-Learner is the first to incorporate machine learning techniques, outperforming these methods in terms of predictive performance, while able to learn models and make predictions efficiently. Moreover, we show that our method was able to identify TEs that none of the above method could find, and we investigated TE-Learner’s predictions which did not correspond to an official annotation. It turns out that many of these predictions are in fact strongly homologous to a known TE.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WmOp0oT-h9c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Leander Schietgat, Celine Vens, Ricardo Cerri, Carlos N.

Previous plant nitrogen diagnostic studies have mostly focused on characteristics of the rice canopy or leaves at some specific points in time, with the long sampling intervals unable to provide detailed and specific “dynamic features.” According to plant growth mechanisms, the dynamic changing rate in leaf shape and color differ between different nitrogen supplements. Therefore, the objective of this study was to diagnose nitrogen stress levels by analyzing the dynamic characteristics of rice leaves. Scanning technology was implemented to collect rice leaf images every 3 days, with the characteristics of the leaves from different leaf positions extracted utilizing MATLAB. Newly developed shape characteristics such as etiolation area (EA) and etiolation degree (ED), in addition to shape (area, perimeter) and color characteristics (green, normalized red index, etc.), were used to quantify the process of leaf change. These characteristics allowed sensitive indices to be established for further model validation. Our results indicate that the changing rates in dynamic characteristics, in particular the shape characteristics of the first incomplete leaf (FIL) and the characteristics of the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; leaf (leaf color and etiolation indices), expressed obvious distinctions among different nitrogen treatments. Consequently, we achieved acceptable diagnostic accuracy (training accuracy 77.3%, validation accuracy 64.4%) by using the FIL at six days after leaf emergence, and the new shape characteristics developed in this article (ED and EA) also showed good performance in nitrogen diagnosis. Based on the aforementioned results, dynamic analysis is valuable not only in further studies but also in practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196298</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7bc6fc75</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanyuan Sun, Shaochun Zhu, Xuan Yang, Melanie Valerie Weston, Ke Wang, Zhangquan Shen, Hongwei Xu, Lisu Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, patchy interstitial fibrosis and diffuse microvascular abnormalities. In IPF, alveolar clustering of iron-laden alveolar macrophages—a common sign of microhemorrhage, has been associated with vascular abnormalities and worsening of pulmonary hypertension. As iron-dependent ROS generation has been shown to induce unrestrained macrophage activation in disease models of vascular damage, we explored alveolar macrophage activation phenotype in IPF patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (CTR, n = 7) by RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The frequencies of macrophages in BAL cells were 86+4% and 83.4+8% in IPF and CTR groups, respectively (p-value = 0.41). In IPF patients, BAL cells showed increased iron-dependent ROS generation (p-value&amp;lt;0.05 vs CTR). Gene expression analysis showed overrepresentation of Gene Ontology processes/functions and KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated M1-type inflammatory (p-value&amp;lt;0.01), M2-type anti-inflammatory/tissue remodeling (p-value&amp;lt;0.0001), and MTPP-type chronic inflammatory/angiogenic (p-value&amp;lt;0.0001) chemokine and cytokine genes. The &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; finding was confirmed by the induction of iron-dependent ROS generation and chemokine/cytokine overexpression of Ccl4, Cxcl10 (M1), Il1rn (M2), Cxcl2, and Cxcl7 (MTPP) in MH-S murine immortalized alveolar macrophages exposed to ferric ammonium citrate in culture (p-value&amp;lt;0.05 vs CTR). The data show alveolar macrophage expression of a pro-inflammatory, tissue remodeling and angiogenic complex activation pattern, suggesting that iron accumulation may play a role in macrophage activation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194803</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b4eabd67</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jungnam Lee, Ivan Arisi, Ermanno Puxeddu, Lazarus K.

South Africa has a Universal Test and Treat (UTT) policy in place to ensure that everyone tests for HIV and can access treatment if they test positive. The aim of this study is to document the pathways that older South Africans who are living with HIV take to access testing and treatment in this context. Despite the aging of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and clear evidence that testing older persons (over age 50) is necessary, very little is known about the circumstances under which older persons test for HIV or their motivations for doing so. In this study, we analyze 21 qualitative, in-depth interviews with women and men aged 50 and over who are living with HIV from two townships outside of Cape Town. Using grounded theory to specify emerging themes, we find similarities and differences between older men and women in their pathways to testing. Men primarily test for HIV when their spouse is diagnosed or in connection with TB testing and treatment. Older women, who are more likely to be widowed or divorced, often test for HIV only when they are symptomatic or not responding appropriately to care for non-communicable diseases. Most importantly, we find that older South Africans do not seek testing as a response to risk. Instead, older men and women test only once they are symptomatic and referred by a provider, or as a result of a partner’s status. Our respondents, particularly the women, expressed “shock” and confusion at learning they were HIV-positive because they do not see themselves as at risk of acquiring HIV. Because the benefits of UTT are greatest with early detection and treatment, older persons’ tendency to test at such a late stage of illness decreases the individual and population level advantages of UTT. More research is needed to understand older persons’ risk and testing behavior so that policy and programs include HIV testing messages that reach this population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196158</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4cb79259</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enid Schatz, Lucia Knight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; is a perennial herbaceous plant species mainly distributed in the tropics or subtropics of Asia and Africa. It has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time and now is utilized for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agriculture industries as a valued economic crop. Recently, &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; has attracted tremendous interest because of its high ceramide content. However, the breeding and genome studies are severely limited by the arduous whole genome sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, the transcriptome data of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by utilizing the high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform.

&lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; is a perennial herbaceous plant species mainly distributed in the tropics or subtropics of Asia and Africa. It has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time and now is utilized for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agriculture industries as a valued economic crop. Recently, &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; has attracted tremendous interest because of its high ceramide content. However, the breeding and genome studies are severely limited by the arduous whole genome sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, the transcriptome data of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by utilizing the high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. Based on this information, the majority of the significant genes involved in the proposed sphingolipid metabolic pathway were identified. Then, the full-length neutral ceramidase cDNA was obtained with the help of its candidate transcripts, which were acquired from the transcriptome data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this neutral ceramidase was a real ceramidase by eukaryotic expression in the yeast double knockout mutant Δypc1 Δydc1, which lacks the ceramidases—dihydroCDase (YDC1p), phytoCDase (YPC1p). In addition, the biochemical characterization of purified &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; ceramidase (AmCDase) exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an optimal activity ranging from pH 6.5 to 8.0.

Aim &lt;p&gt;Long-term care systems may alleviate caregiver burdens, particularly for those with fewer resources. However, it remains unclear whether socioeconomic disparity in caregiver burdens exists under a public, universal long-term care insurance (LTCI) system. This study examined income-based inequalities in caregiving time and depressive symptoms in Japanese older family caregivers. We further compared inequality in depressive symptoms with that of non-caregivers to evaluate whether family caregiving exacerbates this disparity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, nationwide survey conducted by the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study in 2013. Participants were functionally independent older adults aged ≥65 years (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 21,584). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatrics Depression Scale (GDS); caregiving hours per week, household income, and other covariates were also assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Family caregivers occupied 8.3% of the total. A Poisson regression model revealed that caregivers in lower income groups (compared to those in the highest) were 1.32 to 1.95 and 1.63 to 2.68 times more likely to engage in ≥36 and ≥72 hours/week of caregiving, respectively. As for the GDS (≥5), an excess risk was found in the caregivers in lower (compared to higher) income groups (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.57–3.10). However, an interaction effect of income by caregiving role indicated no significant difference in inequality between caregivers and non-caregivers (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .603). The excess risk for GDS (≥5) in the caregivers compared to non-caregivers was observed across income groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed a possible disparity in family caregivers under the public LTCI system. Further studies should examine factors associated with longer caregiving hours in lower income households. Our findings also suggest the necessity for more efforts to alleviate depressive symptoms in family caregivers under the LTCI system regardless of income level, rather than exclusively supporting those with a low income.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194919</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6d9a6f3d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tami Saito, Naoki Kondo, Koichiro Shiba, Chiyoe Murata, Katsunori Kondo&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were functionally independent older adults aged ≥65 years (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 21,584). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatrics Depression Scale (GDS); caregiving hours per week, household income, and other covariates were also assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Family caregivers occupied 8.3% of the total. A Poisson regression model revealed that caregivers in lower income groups (compared to those in the highest) were 1.32 to 1.95 and 1.63 to 2.68 times more likely to engage in ≥36 and ≥72 hours/week of caregiving, respectively. As for the GDS (≥5), an excess risk was found in the caregivers in lower (compared to higher) income groups (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.57–3.10). However, an interaction effect of income by caregiving role indicated no significant difference in inequality between caregivers and non-caregivers (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .603). The excess risk for GDS (≥5) in the caregivers compared to non-caregivers was observed across income groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed a possible disparity in family caregivers under the public LTCI system. Further studies should examine factors associated with longer caregiving hours in lower income households. Our findings also suggest the necessity for more efforts to alleviate depressive symptoms in family caregivers under the LTCI system regardless of income level, rather than exclusively supporting those with a low income.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194919</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Tami Saito</name></author><title>Income-based inequalities in caregiving time and depressive symptoms among older family caregivers under the Japanese long-term care insurance system: A cross-sectional analysis</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424b:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194919</link><published>1522270800000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Lan, Zanlin Mai, Shiyu Zhou, Yang Liu, Shujue Li, Zhijian Zhao, Xiaolu Duan, Cao Cai, Tuo Deng, Wei Zhu, Wenqi Wu, Guohua Zeng&lt;/p&gt;
Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an increasing public health concern because of rapid lifestyle changes. Although there have been previous studies on the prevalence of MS in China, the prevalence may have changed with lifestyle changes over the last decade. To update this prevalence, we performed a cross-sectional survey among adults over 18 years old across China from May 2013 to July 2014. Participants underwent questionnaires and provided blood and urine samples for analysis. MS was defined according to the criteria of the China Diabetes Society. A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively). The results of logistic regression analyses showed that age, urolithiasis, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, thiazide drugs intake, family history of diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR&gt;1). In addition, education, vitamin D intake and family history of urolithiasis are all protective factors (OR&amp;lt;1). Our results indicate that there was a high prevalence of MS in Chinese adults. Compared to the previous study 10 years ago, some preventive strategies have worked; however, further work on the prevention and treatment of MS remains necessary.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b664fda7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Lan, Zanlin Mai, Shiyu Zhou, Yang Liu, Shujue Li, Zhijian Zhao, Xiaolu Duan, Cao Cai, Tuo Deng, Wei Zhu, Wenqi Wu, Guohua Zeng&lt;/p&gt;

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry. The larger amplitude significantly increased bone formation (Fractional bone volume: 19.4% vs. 5.2%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; trabecular thickness: 0.1 mm vs. 0.06 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; mean spicule height: 2.6 mm vs. 1.1 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) however, no endochondral ossification occurred. The elimination of shear movement, unimpaired neovascularization as well as the tensile strain stimuli during the distraction phase suppressing chondrogenic differentiation may all contribute to the absence of cartilage. In clinical application of distraction osteogenesis, moderate axial interfragmentary movement augments intramembranous ossification provided shear strain is minimized.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195466</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>53f003d2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julian Schuelke, Nicholaus Meyers, Sandra Reitmaier, Svenja Klose, Anita Ignatius, Lutz Claes&lt;/p&gt;

Diverse plant pathogens export effector proteins to reprogram host cells. One of the most challenging goals in the molecular plant-microbe field is to functionally characterize the complex repertoires of effectors secreted by these pathogens. For bacterial pathogens, the predominant class of effectors is delivered to host cells by Type III secretion. For oomycetes, the predominant class of effectors is defined by a signal peptide that mediates secretion from the oomycete and a conserved RxLR motif. Downy mildew pathogens and &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/i&gt; species maintain hundreds of candidate RxLR effector genes in their genomes. Although no primary sequence similarity is evident between bacterial Type III effectors (T3Es) and oomycete RXLR effectors, some bacterial and oomycete effectors have convergently evolved to target the same host proteins. Such effectors might have evolved domains that are functionally similar but sequence-unrelated. We reasoned that alignment-free bioinformatics approaches could be useful to identify structural similarities between bacterial and oomycete effectors. To test this approach, we used partial least squares regression, alignment-free bioinformatics methods to identify effector proteins from the genome of the oomycete &lt;i&gt;Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis&lt;/i&gt; that are similar to the well-studied AvrE1 effector from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. This approach identified five RxLR proteins with putative structural similarity to AvrE1. We focused on one, HaRxL23, because it is an experimentally validated effector and it is conserved between distantly related oomycetes. Several experiments indicate that HaRxL23 is functionally similar to AvrE1, including the ability to partially rescue an AvrE1 loss-of-function mutant. This study provides an example of how an alignment-free bioinformatics approach can identify functionally similar effector proteins in the absence of primary sequence similarity. This approach could be useful to identify effectors that have convergently evolved regardless of whether the shared host target is known.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195559</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>48434103</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Devdutta Deb, David Mackey, Stephen O.

Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of built-up areas for a wide range of applications. Recently developed approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of built-up areas using road network data. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard to different administrative regions and cities/towns. The results show that in most cases, the most-appropriate thresholds or ranges for different subdivisions are either identical or overlap—thus validating the use of the most-appropriate thresholds to delineate built-up areas for one or multiple small subdivisions and, by inference, for a much larger region.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194806</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4fd4a592</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qi Zhou, Lei Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;As atrial fibrillation (AF) is often asymptomatic, it may remain undiagnosed until or even after development of complications, such as stroke. Consequently the observed prevalence of AF may underestimate total disease burden.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed AF in the United States, we performed a retrospective cohort modeling study in working age (18–64) and elderly (≥65) people using commercial and Medicare administrative claims databases. We identified patients in years 2004–2010 with incident AF following an ischemic stroke. Using a back-calculation methodology, we estimated the prevalence of undiagnosed AF as the ratio of the number of post-stroke AF patients and the CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-specific stroke probability for each patient, adjusting for age and gender composition based on United States census data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The estimated prevalence of AF (diagnosed and undiagnosed) was 3,873,900 (95%CI: 3,675,200–4,702,600) elderly and 1,457,100 (95%CI: 1,218,500–1,695,800) working age adults, representing 10.0% and 0.92% of the respective populations. Of these, 698,900 were undiagnosed: 535,400 (95%CI: 331,900–804,400) elderly and 163,500 (95%CI: 17,700–400,000) working age adults, representing 1.3% and 0.09% of the respective populations. Among all undiagnosed cases, 77% had a CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score ≥1, and 56% had CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score ≥2.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Using a back-calculation approach, we estimate that the total AF prevalence in 2009 was 5.3 million of which 0.7 million (13.1% of AF cases) were undiagnosed. Over half of the modeled population with undiagnosed AF was at moderate to high risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195088</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>26eebced</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mintu P.

We collected soil and plant samples after rice harvest from a free-air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment (FACE) system, which had already run for more than 15 years. Our results show that eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased PAH concentrations in the soil, and we link this effect to a shift in soil microbial community structure and function. Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; changed the composition of soil microbial communities, especially by reducing the abundance of some microbial groups driving PAH degradation. Our study indicates that elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels may weaken the self-cleaning ability of soils related to organic pollutants.

Such changes in the function of soil microbial communities may threaten the quality of crops, with unknown implications for food safety and human health in future climate scenarios.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196439</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Fuxun Ai</name></author><title>Elevated CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; accelerates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon accumulation in a paddy soil grown with rice</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524603600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb8:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196439</link><published>1524603600000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00336</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00336/20180412/images/medium/jm-2018-00336k_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00336&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Chronic constipation is a functional gastrointestinal disease that is detrimental to the quality of patient life. &lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; L. (CO) and &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; M. (FV) are commonly used as medicinal foods in many countries. We aimed to examine the laxative effect and their underlying mechanism of CO and FV mixture on loperamide (lop)-induced constipated rats. To determine the laxative effects of these compounds, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: the control, lop-induced constipated (2mg/kg), and three doses (100, 300, and 500mg/kg) of CO and FV mixture-, and Bisacodyl (bis, 3.3mg/kg)-treated groups. The mixture of CO and FV and bis were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. For induction of constipation, the lop were treated with a dose of 2 mg/kg twice a day on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week after treatments of CO and FV extracts and bis. The results were revealed that the CO and FV mixture has the laxative effects more than those in CO and FV-alone treatments on constipated rats by determining the stool parameters, including stool number and weight. Indeed, stool parameters, such as, stool number, weight, and water contents and colonic peristalsis from the intestinal transit length and ratio were dramatically improved by CO and FV mixture treatment. Histological study also revealed that CO and FV mixture enhanced the thicknesses of mucosa and muscular layers of the colon in constipated rats. For their underlying mechanism, the mRNAs and proteins expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) M2 and M3 and their downstream signaling were preserved by CO and FV mixture treatment in constipated rats. Therefore, this study suggests that treatment with CO and FV mixture has beneficial effects against constipation. We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195624</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>302f39ea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Hee Jang, Dong Kwon Yang&lt;/p&gt;

We aimed to examine the laxative effect and their underlying mechanism of CO and FV mixture on loperamide (lop)-induced constipated rats. To determine the laxative effects of these compounds, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: the control, lop-induced constipated (2mg/kg), and three doses (100, 300, and 500mg/kg) of CO and FV mixture-, and Bisacodyl (bis, 3.3mg/kg)-treated groups. The mixture of CO and FV and bis were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. For induction of constipation, the lop were treated with a dose of 2 mg/kg twice a day on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week after treatments of CO and FV extracts and bis. The results were revealed that the CO and FV mixture has the laxative effects more than those in CO and FV-alone treatments on constipated rats by determining the stool parameters, including stool number and weight. Indeed, stool parameters, such as, stool number, weight, and water contents and colonic peristalsis from the intestinal transit length and ratio were dramatically improved by CO and FV mixture treatment. Histological study also revealed that CO and FV mixture enhanced the thicknesses of mucosa and muscular layers of the colon in constipated rats. For their underlying mechanism, the mRNAs and proteins expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) M2 and M3 and their downstream signaling were preserved by CO and FV mixture treatment in constipated rats. Therefore, this study suggests that treatment with CO and FV mixture has beneficial effects against constipation. We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195624</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Seung Hee Jang</name></author><title>The combination of &amp;lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&amp;lt;/i&gt; L. and &amp;lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&amp;lt;/i&gt; M. exhibits a laxative effect on loperamide-induced constipation of rats</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d748:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195624</link><published>1522962000000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tien-Kieu Nguyen, Moon-Gi Hong, Pahn-Shick Chang, Byung-Hoo Lee, Sang-Ho Yoo&lt;/p&gt;
d-Tagatose has gained substantial interest due to its potential functionalities as a sucrose substitute. In this study, the gene &lt;i&gt;araA&lt;/i&gt;, encoding l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) from &lt;i&gt;Clostridium hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; (DSM 15053), was cloned and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; BL21 (DE3). This gene consists of 1,506 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 501 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56,554 Da. Since l-AI was expressed as an intracellular inclusion body, this enzyme was solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride, refolded, and activated with a descending concentration gradient of urea. The purified enzyme exhibited the greatest activity at 50°C, pH 7–7.5, and required 1 mM of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor. Notably, the catalytic efficiency (3.69 mM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) of l-AI from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; on galactose was significantly greater than that of other previously reported enzymes. The bioconversion yield of d-tagatose using the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; l-arabinose isomerase at 60°C reached approximately 46% from 10 mM of d-galactose after 2 h. From these results, it is suggested that the l-arabinose isomerase from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; could be utilized as a potential enzyme for d-tagatose production due to its high conversion yield at an industrially competitive temperature.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>afe65d58</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tien-Kieu Nguyen, Moon-Gi Hong, Pahn-Shick Chang, Byung-Hoo Lee, Sang-Ho Yoo&lt;/p&gt;

Recent advances suggest that impairment in social cognition (SC) may play a role in the development of social anxiety (SA). However, very few studies have analyzed whether SA fosters poorer social-cognitive development as it leads to social avoidance. This study aimed to analyze whether retrospectively assessed behavioral inhibition (BI) (i.e., an early form of SA) in childhood is associated with a deficit in social cognition operationalized as impairment of mentalizing (MZ) in adolescence. A sample of 256 adolescents (range: 12–18 years; mean age: 14.7 years; &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 1.7) from general population were assessed for MZ capacities and retrospective BI through self-report and interview measures. Results comparing three groups of adolescents with different levels of childhood BI (low, moderate or high) and controlling for concurrent SA and depression reveal that the higher the level of BI, the lower the level of MZ. These results were consistent for almost all mentalization measures, including when both extreme (i.e., high vs. low BI) and non-extreme (i.e., high vs. moderate BI) were compared in both self-report and interview measures and in both dimensions of MZ (i.e., MZ referred to others’ and to own mental states). These findings support that childhood forms of SA are associated to deficit in SC in adolescence. A possible bi-directional relationship between SA and SC, and the role that it may play in the pathway to clinical SA are discussed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e784a6d6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sergi Ballespí, Ariadna Pérez-Domingo, Jaume Vives, Carla Sharp, Neus Barrantes-Vidal&lt;/p&gt;

The structure and function of clinical dosage insulin and its analogues were assessed. This included ‘native insulins’ (human recombinant, bovine, porcine), ‘fast-acting analogues’ (aspart, glulisine, lispro) and ‘slow-acting analogues’ (glargine, detemir, degludec). Analytical ultracentrifugation, both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments, were employed to yield distributions of both molar mass and sedimentation coefficient of all nine insulins. Size exclusion chromatography, coupled to multi-angle light scattering, was also used to explore the function of these analogues. On ultracentrifugation analysis, the insulins under investigation were found to be in numerous conformational states, however the majority of insulins were present in a primarily hexameric conformation. This was true for all native insulins and two fast-acting analogues. However, glargine was present as a dimer, detemir was a multi-hexameric system, degludec was a dodecamer (di-hexamer) and glulisine was present as a dimer-hexamer-dihexamer system. However, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the two hexameric fast-acting analogues (aspart and lispro) dissociated into monomers and dimers due to the lack of zinc in the mobile phase. This comprehensive study is the first time all nine insulins have been characterised in this way, the first time that insulin detemir have been studied using analytical ultracentrifugation and the first time that insulins aspart and glulisine have been studied using sedimentation equilibrium. The structure and function of these clinically administered insulins is of critical importance and this research adds novel data to an otherwise complex functional physiological protein.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195010</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>72e2dd6e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gary G.

In tropical and subtropical lakes, eutrophication often leads to nuisance blooms of &lt;i&gt;Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii&lt;/i&gt;. In laboratory experiments, we tested the combined effects of flocculant polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB) on the sinking and growth rates of three &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of PAC and LMB would (1) effectively sink &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; in a test tube experiment and (2) impair &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; growth, irrespective of the biomass of the inoculum (bloom) and the strain in the growth experiment. We tested the recommended (LMB1) and a three-times higher dose of LMB (LMB3). The combined addition of PAC and LMB enhanced the sedimentation of all &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. Moreover, both the PAC and LMB doses decreased the phosphate concentration. PAC and LMB1 decreased the growth rate of all strains, but the efficacy depended on the biomass and strain. The combined addition of PAC and LMB3 inhibited the growth of all strains independently of the biomass and strain. We conclude that a low dose of PAC in combination with the recommended dose of LMB decreases &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms and that the efficiency of the technique depends on the biomass of the bloom.

Phycobilisomes (PBS) are accessory light harvesting protein complexes formed mainly by phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The PBPs absorb light that is efficiently transferred to Photosystems due to chromophores covalently bound to specific cysteine residues. Besides phycobiliproteins (PE), the PBS contains linker proteins responsible for assembly and stabilization of the whole complex and the tuning of energy transfer steps between chromophores. The linker (γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria chilensis&lt;/i&gt;, is a chromophorylated rod linker associated to (αβ)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; hexamers of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE). Its role in the energy transfer process is not clear yet. Structural studies as well as the composition and location of the chromophores are essential to understand their involvement in the energy transfer process in PBS. To achieve this, the coding gene of γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was analyzed by informatics tools, to obtain preliminary information which leaded the next experiments. The protein was purified from R-phycoerythrin, and the sequence confirmed by mass spectrometry. The coding sequence analysis revealed a protein of 318 aminoacid residues containing a chloroplastidial transit peptide (cTP) of 39 aminoacids at the N-terminus. The conservation of cysteines revealed possible chromophorylation sites. Using α and β R-PE subunits as spectroscopic probes in denaturation assays, we deduced a double bonded phycourobilin (PUB) on γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; subunit that were confirmed between Cys62 and Cys73 (DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;62/73&lt;/sup&gt;) by mass spectrometry. The cysteines involved in the double link are located in a helical region, in a conformation that reminds the position of the DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;50/61&lt;/sup&gt; in the β subunit of R-PE. The position of single linked PUB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt; and a single linked PEB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; were also confirmed. Spectroscopic studies show the presence of both types of chromophores and that there are not energy transfer by FRET among them.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195656</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7c771e50</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aleikar Vásquez-Suárez, Francisco Lobos-González, Andrew Cronshaw, José Sepúlveda-Ugarte, Maximiliano Figueroa, Jorge Dagnino-Leone, Marta Bunster, José Martínez-Oyanedel&lt;/p&gt;

Based on AspICU algorithm, 21 had putative IA (8.9%), 12 were colonised (5.1%).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Adjusting the confounding factors, significant risk factors for IA were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), temperature of ≥38°C, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The best predictor of IA was AspICU algorithm (AUC, 1) followed by serum galactomannan antigen (GM) cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.822). For 37% of patients, IA diagnoses was made earlier with serum GM than radiology. There were 70/235 (29.8%) deaths within 30 days of enrolment in the study. &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; culture positivity (34/235, 14.5%) was associated with very high mortality (27/34, 79.4%), (p&amp;lt;0.05). The best predictor of mortality was GM cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.835).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study imparts the focus on relatively underestimated &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; infections prevalent in ICUs.

The accurate identification and quality evaluation of herbal medical plants is highly necessary to ensure their safety and efficacy. In present study, a new strategy combining DNA barcoding techniques with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was proposed to facilitate the identification and quality control of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt;. In present work, the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) barcode was successfully used to identify 58 &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt; samples and its adulterants. TLC successfully identified the other three &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt; samples that failed to produce ITS2 regions. An adulterant was found in all the 62 samples. Moreover, the content of active medicinal ingredients is important for herbal plants quality. The content of tenacissoside H (TS-H) of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt; samples was determined by HPLC to range from 0.39% to 1.09%, which meets the criterion of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.

It is generally believed that the unencapsulated sensory nerve terminals of modality specific C- and Aδ-neurons lack structural specialization. Here we determined the morphology of functionally defined polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors in the guinea pig corneal epithelium. Polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors were identified by extracellular recording at the surface of the corneal epithelium. After marking the recording sites, corneas were processed to reveal immunoreactivity for the transient receptor potential channels TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) or TPRM8 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8). Polymodal receptor nerve terminals (n = 6) were TRPV1-immunoreactive and derived from an axon that ascended from the sub-basal plexus to the squamous cell layer where it branched into fibers that ran parallel to the corneal surface and terminated with small bulbar endings (ramifying endings). Cold thermoreceptor nerve terminals were TRPM8-immunoreactive (n = 6) and originated from an axon that branched as it ascended through the wing cell and squamous cell layers and terminated with large bulbar endings (complex endings). These findings indicate that modality specific corneal sensory neurons with unencapsulated nerve endings have distinct nerve terminal morphologies that are likely to relate to their function.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195108</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>feea6803</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Abdulhakeem S.

Many physical simulations aim at evaluating the net interaction between two rigid bodies, resulting from the cumulative effect of pairwise interactions between their constituents. This is manifested particularly in biomolecular applications such as hierarchical protein folding instances where the interaction between almost rigid domains directly influences the folding pathway, the interaction between macromolecules for drug design purposes, self-assembly of nanoparticles for drug design and drug delivery, and design of smart materials and bio-sensors. In general, the brute force approach requires quadratic (in terms of the number of particles) number of pairwise evaluation operations for any relative pose of the two bodies, unless simplifying assumptions lead to a collapse of the computational complexity. We propose to approximate the pairwise interaction function using a linear predictor function, in which the basis functions have separated forms, i.e. the variables that describe local geometries of the two rigid bodies and the ones that reflect the relative pose between them are split in each basis function. Doing so replaces the quadratic number of interaction evaluations for each relative pose with a one-time quadratic computation of a set of characteristic parameters at a preprocessing step, plus constant number of pose function evaluations at each pose, where this constant is determined by the required accuracy of approximation as well as the efficiency of the used approximation method. We will show that the standard deviation of the error for the net interaction is linearly (in terms of number of particles) proportional to the regression error, if the regression errors are from a normal distribution. Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195618</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7fa8e306</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pouya Tavousi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to conduct an indirect treatment comparison between cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel relative to comparators in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who progress on docetaxel-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) Intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83–1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69–1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41–75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03–10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14–206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195790</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1d131747</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jon P.

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study is aimed to evaluate the physiochemical properties and cytotoxicity of mercury-based formulation for the development of anticancer therapeuticals.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological features of the formulation were characterized by FE-SEM, XPS and EDS. The described formulation was evaluated for its cytotoxicity on Hek293 and MCF7 cell lines using MTT assay to study the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; effects. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; developmental toxicity was also studied on zebrafish embryos and the lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values were calculated as per the OECD regulations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological characterizations confirmed the presence of mercuric compounds. The particles were spherical and stable with the size ranges between 20 and 80nm. Although the PK formulation contains mercurials it was very effective only to cancerous cells (MCF-7) and it is less toxic to normal cells (HEK 293). The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessment of developmental toxicity on zebrafish embryo confirmed the safer dosage of 100μg/ml. However, a higher dosage of 1mg/ml led to the malformation of embryos such as pericardial, tail and yolk sac edema.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The physiochemical characterization of PK formulation confirmed the presence of HgS. The results of both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that the formulation is less toxic.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. This warrants a search for risk factors of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1±8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days. Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; &amp;lt;15 [reference category], 15-&amp;lt;30, ≥30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.30 (95%CI = 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.71 (-1.08; -0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195306</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>76a5e3f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Remy J.
