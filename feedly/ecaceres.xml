The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been decreasing globally, but the growing effects of HCV-related morbidity and mortality remain of concern. Advances in curative medicine, involving direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), have led many countries to aim to eradicate HCV. Information on epidemiology and disease burden is essential for national policy development. Thus, this study aimed to determine the HCV-related hepatic disease burden in areas of Thailand with high and average HCV prevalence in order to extrapolate the viral burden across Thailand. Patients previously diagnosed as positive for anti-HCV antibodies were recruited to assess chronic HCV infection (CHC) status, liver function, HCV-RNA level and hepatic fibrosis. The number of patients eligible for Universal Health Coverage (UC) scheme and the approximately required expenditure on interferon (IFN)-based treatment were estimated. In areas of both high (12%) and average (2%) HCV viremic prevalence, over half of the patients (52.2% to 62.5%) had advanced liver fibrosis (F3 and F4). A striking percentage of patients with F4 (38.9%) were found in the high-prevalence area, while comparable proportions of advanced liver fibrosis presented in the two areas and disease burden peaked at 50‚Äì59 years. Under the current UC program treatment scenario, 78‚Äì83% of CHC patients with stage F2‚ÄìF4 fibrosis were eligible for treatment. The estimated expenditure required for overall CHC treatment across the whole country was 1,240 million USD at this current status, but the declining cost of generic DAA-based therapy may reduce the requirement to &amp;lt;90 million USD. This study provides information on the estimated number of CHC patients, liver disease burden and expenditure requirements for Thailand. To eliminate HCV by 2030, proactive government strategies raising public health to minimize transmission and emphasizing targeted screen-and-treatment programs, novel therapeutic guideline development for decentralizing treatment, and effective budget allocation are urgently needed.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907faa:34f43e70</id><title>Liver disease burden and required treatment expenditures for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Thailand: Implications for HCV elimination in the new therapeutic era, a population-based study</title><fingerprint>f2997682</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rujipat Wasitthankasem, Preeyaporn Vichaiwattana, Nipaporn Siripon, Nawarat Posuwan, Chompoonut Auphimai, Sirapa Klinfueng, Napha Thanetkongtong, Viboonsak Vuthitanachot, Supapith Saiyatha, Chaiwat Thongmai, Saowakon Sochoo, Natnada Pongsuwan, Kittiyod Poovorawan, Pisit Tangkijvanich, Yong Poovorawan&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanical ventilation is an important tool for supporting critically ill patients but may also exert pathological forces on lung cells leading to Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). We hypothesised that inhibition of the force-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV4) ion channel may attenuate the negative effects of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical stretch increased intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung epithelial cells that was partially blocked by about 30% with the selective TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874, but nearly completely blocked with the pan-calcium channel blocker ruthenium red, suggesting the involvement of more than one calcium channel in the response to mechanical stress. Mechanical stretch also induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages, but in contrast this was entirely dependent upon TRPV4. In a murine ventilation model, TRPV4 inhibition attenuated both pulmonary barrier permeability increase and pro-inflammatory cytokines release due to high tidal volume ventilation. Taken together, these data suggest TRPV4 inhibitors may have utility as a prophylactic pharmacological treatment to improve the negative pathological stretch-response of lung cells during ventilation and potentially support patients receiving mechanical ventilation.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344164:7d6c1c1c</id><title>TRPV4 inhibition attenuates stretch-induced inflammatory cellular responses and lung barrier dysfunction during mechanical ventilation</title><fingerprint>425da426</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by N.

Bdelloid rotifers are a class of microscopic invertebrates that have existed for millions of years apparently without sex or meiosis. They inhabit a variety of temporary and permanent freshwater habitats globally, and many species are remarkably tolerant of desiccation. Bdelloids offer an opportunity to better understand the evolution of sex and recombination, but previous work has emphasised desiccation as the cause of several unusual genomic features in this group. Here, we present high-quality whole-genome sequences of 3 bdelloid species: &lt;i&gt;Rotaria macrura&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magnacalcarata&lt;/i&gt;, which are both desiccation intolerant, and &lt;i&gt;Adineta ricciae&lt;/i&gt;, which is desiccation tolerant. In combination with the published assembly of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaga&lt;/i&gt;, which is also desiccation tolerant, we apply a comparative genomics approach to evaluate the potential effects of desiccation tolerance and asexuality on genome evolution in bdelloids. We find that ancestral tetraploidy is conserved among all 4 bdelloid species, but homologous divergence in obligately aquatic &lt;i&gt;Rotaria&lt;/i&gt; genomes is unexpectedly low. This finding is contrary to current models regarding the role of desiccation in shaping bdelloid genomes. In addition, we find that homologous regions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ricciae&lt;/i&gt; are largely collinear and do not form palindromic repeats as observed in the published &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaga&lt;/i&gt; assembly. Consequently, several features interpreted as genomic evidence for long-term ameiotic evolution are not general to all bdelloid species, even within the same genus. Finally, we substantiate previous findings of high levels of horizontally transferred nonmetazoan genes in both desiccating and nondesiccating bdelloid species and show that this unusual feature is not shared by other animal phyla, even those with desiccation-tolerant representatives. These comparisons call into question the proposed role of desiccation in mediating horizontal genetic transfer.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y70C1gFZUSk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f8c0d479:29c06a:ae8b474d</id><title>Comparative genomics of bdelloid rotifers: Insights from desiccating and nondesiccating species</title><fingerprint>8d6ff735</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Reuben W.

The macaque is widely accepted as a suitable model for preclinical characterization of dengue vaccine candidates. However, the only vaccine for which both preclinical and clinical efficacy results were reported so far showed efficacy levels that were substantially different between macaques and humans. We hypothesized that this model‚Äôs predictive capacity may be improved using recent and minimally passaged dengue virus isolates, and by assessing vaccine efficacy by characterizing not only the post-dengue virus challenge viremia/RNAemia but also the associated-cytokine profile. Ten recent and minimally passaged Brazilian clinical isolates from the four dengue virus serotypes were tested for their infectivity in rhesus macaques. For the strains showing robust replication capacity, the associated-changes in soluble mediator levels, and the elicited dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses, were also characterized. Three isolates from dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 4 induced viremia of high magnitude and longer duration relative to previously reported viremia kinetics in this model, and robust dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses. Consistent with observations in humans, increased MCP-1, IFN-Œ≥ and VEGF-A levels, and transiently decreased IL-8 levels were detected after infection with the selected isolates. These results may contribute to establishing a dengue macaque model showing a higher predictability for vaccine efficacy in humans.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67bb:91749e5b</id><title>Characterization of recent and minimally passaged Brazilian dengue viruses inducing robust infection in rhesus macaques</title><fingerprint>a848de53</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Beatriz Borges, Renato Sergio Marchevsky, Ygara S.

Landscape connectivity is integral to the persistence of metapopulations of wide ranging carnivores and other terrestrial species. The objectives of this research were to investigate the landscape characteristics essential to use of areas by lynx and bobcats in northern New England, map a habitat availability model for each species, and explore connectivity across areas of the region likely to experience future development pressure. A Mahalanobis distance analysis was conducted on location data collected between 2005 and 2010 from 16 bobcats in western Vermont and 31 lynx in northern Maine to determine which variables were most consistent across all locations for each species using three scales based on average 1) local (15 minute) movement, 2) linear distance between daily locations, and 3) female home range size. The bobcat model providing the widest separation between used locations and random study area locations suggests that they cue into landscape features such as edge, availability of cover, and development density at different scales. The lynx model with the widest separation between random and used locations contained five variables including natural habitat, cover, and elevation‚Äîall at different scales. Shrub scrub habitat‚Äîwhere lynx‚Äôs preferred prey is most abundant‚Äîwas represented at the daily distance moved scale. Cross validation indicated that outliers had little effect on models for either species. A habitat suitability value was calculated for each 30 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; pixel across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine for each species and used to map connectivity between conserved lands within selected areas across the region. Projections of future landscape change illustrated potential impacts of anthropogenic development on areas lynx and bobcat may use, and indicated where connectivity for bobcats and lynx may be lost. These projections provided a guide for conservation of landscape permeability for lynx, bobcat, and species relying on similar habitats in the region.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2818:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Landscape connectivity for bobcat (&amp;lt;i&gt;Lynx rufus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) and lynx (&amp;lt;i&gt;Lynx canadensis&amp;lt;/i&gt;) in the Northeastern United States</title><fingerprint>bba0808e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura E.

Whereas probabilistic genome evolution models provided theoretical foundation to comparative genomics studies, it remains challenging to extend DNA evolution models to epigenomes. Results: We present an effort to develop ab initio evolution models for epigenomes, by explicitly expressing the joint probability of multispecies DNA sequences and histone modifications on homologous genomic regions. This joint probability is modeled as a mixture of four components representing four evolutionary hypotheses, namely dependence and independence of interspecies epigenomic variations to sequence mutations and to sequence insertions and deletions (indels). For model fitting, we implemented a maximum likelihood method by coupling downhill simplex algorithm with dynamic programming. Based on likelihood comparisons, the model can be used to infer whether interspecies epigenomic variations depend on mutation or indels in local genomic sequences. We applied this model to analyze DNase hypersensitive regions and spermatid H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from human and rhesus macaque. Approximately 5.5% of homologous regions in the genomes exhibited H3K4me3 modification in either species, among which approximately 67% homologous regions exhibited sequence-dependent interspecies H3K4me3 variations. Mutations accounted for less sequence-dependent H3K4me3 variations than indels. Among transposon-mediated indels, ERV1 insertions and L1 insertions were most strongly associated with H3K4me3 gains and losses, respectively.

Results: We present an effort to develop ab initio evolution models for epigenomes, by explicitly expressing the joint probability of multispecies DNA sequences and histone modifications on homologous genomic regions. This joint probability is modeled as a mixture of four components representing four evolutionary hypotheses, namely dependence and independence of interspecies epigenomic variations to sequence mutations and to sequence insertions and deletions (indels). For model fitting, we implemented a maximum likelihood method by coupling downhill simplex algorithm with dynamic programming. Based on likelihood comparisons, the model can be used to infer whether interspecies epigenomic variations depend on mutation or indels in local genomic sequences. We applied this model to analyze DNase hypersensitive regions and spermatid H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from human and rhesus macaque. Approximately 5.5% of homologous regions in the genomes exhibited H3K4me3 modification in either species, among which approximately 67% homologous regions exhibited sequence-dependent interspecies H3K4me3 variations. Mutations accounted for less sequence-dependent H3K4me3 variations than indels. Among transposon-mediated indels, ERV1 insertions and L1 insertions were most strongly associated with H3K4me3 gains and losses, respectively. Conclusion: This work initiates a class of probabilistic evolution models that jointly model the genomes and the epigenomes, thus helps to bring evolutionary principles to comparative epigenomic studies.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282</link><updated>1522875600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/h-ldp2fjUm4/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Stanley E.

Biologists determine experimental effects by perturbing biological entities or units. When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity‚Äìintervention pair contributes to the sample size (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;) and forms the basis of statistical inference. If the wrong entity‚Äìintervention pair is chosen, an experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17%‚Äì29%) replicated the correct entity‚Äìintervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38%‚Äì53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26%‚Äì39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/h-ldp2fjUm4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16291bed3a0:b8480a:76251cdd</id><title>What exactly is ‚Äò&amp;lt;i&gt;N&amp;lt;/i&gt;‚Äô in cell culture and animal experiments?</title><fingerprint>37283983</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stanley E.

Finally, EFR allow to further the understanding of the protein folding process due to their pivotal role.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</originId><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04163-8/d41586-018-04163-8_15592930.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width></visual><unread>True</unread><author><name>Esther Landhuis</name></author><published>1523430000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>25</engagement><crawled>1523437701026</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outsourcing is in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing is in, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04163-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As big pharma downsizes, contract research organizations are reaping the benefits.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162b3f687a2:435f40:9f3b30f2</id><title>Outsourcing is in</title><fingerprint>a35630b1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outsourcing is in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing is in, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04163-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As big pharma downsizes, contract research organizations are reaping the benefits.</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300046v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300046v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300046v1?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/13/300046</canonicalUrl><author><name>Pacheco, A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Pro-active case detection (Pro-ACD), in the form of voluntary screening and treatment (VSAT) following community mobilisation about ‚Äòasymptomatic malaria‚Äô, is currently being evaluated as a tool for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; elimination in Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted to explore community understanding, perceptions, expectations and acceptability of the Pro-ACD intervention in order to identify aspects that could be improved in future Pro-ACD activities. This was ancillary to a three-round VSAT campaign, carried out in three villages between December 2015 and March 2016. Qualitative data collection began shortly after the end of the three rounds of screening. Purposive sampling was used to select participants. Nine focus group discussions with participants (n = 46) and non-participants (n = 40) in the Pro-ACD screening were conducted, in addition to in-depth interviews with key village figures (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Health promotion messages were well delivered and received, but it was difficult for many villagers to understand the messages around ‚Äòasymptomatic malaria‚Äô. Overall, villagers and village leaders had a positive opinion about the VSAT intervention. Acceptability was high, as a direct consequence of favourable perceptions towards the screening activity: the Pro-ACD intervention was seen by the local population as an effective, inexpensive, reliable and readily available tool to protect individuals and the community from the insurgence of malaria. Physical absence and lack of time (both linked to work-related activities) were the main reasons for non-participation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although VSAT was generally well perceived and accepted, the ‚Äòtime factor‚Äô related to the need to satisfy essential daily subsistence requirements played a significant role in determining participation in the screening.

GDSL lipase (GLIP) plays a pivotal role in plant cell growth as a multifunctional hydrolytic enzyme. Herein, a cotton (&lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; L. cv Xuzhou 142) GDSL lipase gene (&lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;) was obtained from developing ovules and fibers. The &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,143 base pairs (bp) and encodes a putative polypeptide of 380 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment indicated that GhGLIP includes four enzyme catalytic amino acid residue sites of Ser (S), Gly (G), Asn (N) and His (H), located in four conserved blocks. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that GhGLIP belongs to the typical class IV lipase family with potential functions in plant secondary metabolism. Subcellular distribution analysis demonstrated that GhGLIP localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane. &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; was expressed predominantly at 5‚Äì15 day post anthesis (dpa) in developing ovules and elongating fibers, measured as mRNA levels and enzyme activity. Ectopic overexpression of &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; in Arabidopsis plants resulted in enhanced seed development, including length and fresh weight. Meanwhile, there was increased soluble sugar and protein storage in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, coupled with the promotion of lipase activity. Moreover, the expression of cotton &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; is induced by ethylene (ETH) treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. A 1,954-bp &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; promoter was isolated and expressed high activity in driving green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression in tobacco leaves. &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting element analysis of the &lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&lt;/i&gt; promoter (&lt;i&gt;pGhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;) indicated the presence of an ethylene-responsive element (ERE), and transgenic tobacco leaves with ectopic expression of &lt;i&gt;pGhGLIP&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP-GUS&lt;/i&gt; showed increased GUS activity after ETH treatment. In summary, these results suggest that GhGLIP is a functional enzyme involved in ovule and fiber development and performs significant roles in seed development.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d741:9f3b30f2</id><title>A &amp;lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&amp;lt;/i&gt; GDSL lipase/hydrolase gene (&amp;lt;i&gt;GhGLIP&amp;lt;/i&gt;) appears to be involved in promoting seed growth in Arabidopsis</title><fingerprint>66975b42</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rendi Ma, Hali Yuan, Jing An, Xiaoyun Hao, Hongbin Li&lt;/p&gt;

Such separations, especially the removal of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from methane, are of great technological relevance in the context of the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù of natural gas, landfill gas, and biogas. While more than 50 zeolite frameworks have been synthesised in aluminophosphate composition or as heteroatom substituted AlPO derivatives, only a few of them have been characterised experimentally with regard to their adsorption and separation behaviour. In order to predict the potential of a variety of AlPO frameworks for applications in CO2/CH4 and CH4/N2 separations, atomistic grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed for 53 different structures. Building on previous work, which studied CO2/N2 mixture adsorption in AlPOs (M. Fischer, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2017, 19, 22801‚Äì22812), force field parameters for methane adsorption in AlPOs were validated through a comparison to available experimental adsorption data. Afterwards, CO2/CH4 and CH4/N2 mixture isotherms were computed for all 53 frameworks for room temperature and total pressures up to 1000 kPa (10 bar), allowing the prediction of selectivities and working capacities for conditions that are relevant for pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA). For CO2/CH4 mixtures, the GIS, SIV, and ATT frameworks were found to have the highest selectivities and CO2 working capacities under VSA conditions, whereas several frameworks, among them AFY, KFI, AEI, and LTA, show higher working capacities under PSA conditions. For CH4/N2 mixtures, all frameworks are moderately selective for methane over nitrogen, with ATV exhibiting a significantly higher selectivity than all other frameworks. While some of the most promising topologies are either not available in pure-AlPO4 composition or collapse upon calcination, others can be synthesised and activated, rendering them interesting candidates for future experimental studies. In addition to predictions of mixture adsorption isotherms, further simulations were performed for four selected systems in order to investigate the microscopic origins of the macroscopic adsorption behaviour, e.g. with regard to the very high CH4/N2 selectivity of ATV and the loading-dependent evolution of the heat of CO2 adsorption and CO2/CH4 selectivity of AEI and GME.</content></summary><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Porous_Aluminophosphates_as_Adsorbents_for_the_Separation_of_CO2_CH4_and_CH4_N2_Mixtures_a_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Study/6133346</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Porous_Aluminophosphates_as_Adsorbents_for_the_Separation_of_CO2_CH4_and_CH4_N2_Mixtures_a_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Study/6133346</originId><published>1523491200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523542114066</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_162ba2fbf12:e4baf4:9f3b30f2</id><title>Porous Aluminophosphates as Adsorbents for the Separation of CO2/CH4 and CH4/N2 Mixtures ‚Äì a Monte Carlo Simulation Study</title><fingerprint>f66ef981</fingerprint><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><description>Aluminophosphates with zeolite-like topologies (AlPOs) have received considerable attention as potential adsorbents for use in the separation of methane-containing gas mixtures.

Human beings are exposed to compressed air or a nitrogen-oxygen mixture, they will produce signs and symptoms of nitrogen narcosis such as amnesia or even loss of memory, which may be disappeared once back to the normobaric environment. This study was designed to investigate the effect of nitrogen narcosis induced by repetitive hyperbaric nitrogen-oxygen mixture exposure on long-term cognitive function in newborn mice and the underlying mechanisms. The electroencephalogram frequency was decreased while the amplitude was increased in a pressure-dependent manner during 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 MPa (million pascal) nitrogen-oxygen mixture exposures in adult mice. Nitrogen narcosis in postnatal days 7‚Äì9 mice but not in adult mice induced by repetitive hyperbaric exposure prolonged the latency to find the platform and decreased the number of platform-site crossovers during Morris water maze tests, and reduced the time in the center during the open field tests. An increase in the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in the hippocampus and cortex were observed immediately on the first day after hyperbaric exposure, and this lasted for seven days. Additionally, nitrogen narcosis induced loss of the dendritic spines but not of the neurons, which may mainly account for the cognitive dysfunction. Nitrogen narcosis induced long-term cognitive and emotional dysfunction in the postnatal mice but not in the adult mice, which may result from neuronal apoptosis and especially reduction of dendritic spines of neurons.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefbc:11c251fd</id><title>Nitrogen narcosis induced by repetitive hyperbaric nitrogen oxygen mixture exposure impairs long-term cognitive function in newborn mice</title><fingerprint>74c16cd1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bin Peng, Shun-Hua Peng, Run-Ming Qu, Li-Hua Xu, Zheng-Lin Jiang&lt;/p&gt;

Competitive pressure to maximize the current bibliometric measures of productivity is jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific literature. Efforts are underway to address the ‚Äòreproducibility crisis‚Äô by encouraging the use of more rigorous, confirmatory methods. However, as long as productivity continues to be defined by the number of discoveries scientists publish, the impact factor of the journals they publish in and the number of times their papers are cited, they will be reluctant to accept high quality methods and consistently conduct and publish confirmatory/replication studies. This exploratory study examined a sample of rigorous Phase II-IV clinical trials, including unpublished studies, to determine if more appropriate metrics and incentives can be developed. The results suggest that rigorous procedures will help reduce false positives, but to the extent that higher quality methods are accepted as the standard of practice, the current bibliometric incentives will discourage innovative studies and encourage scientists to shift their research to less informative studies of subjects that are already being more actively investigated. However, the results also suggest that it is possible to develop a more appropriate system of rewards. In contrast to the current bibliometric incentives, evaluations of the quality of the methods and reproducibility of the results, innovation and diversity of thought, and amount of information produced may serve as measures and incentives that maintain the integrity of the scientific literature and maximize scientific progress.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f65:34f43e70</id><title>Scientific productivity: An exploratory study of metrics and incentives</title><fingerprint>c68ecb99</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mark D.

In contrast to the current bibliometric incentives, evaluations of the quality of the methods and reproducibility of the results, innovation and diversity of thought, and amount of information produced may serve as measures and incentives that maintain the integrity of the scientific literature and maximize scientific progress.</description></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/272?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/272?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/272?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/272.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Halpern, P.</name></author><published>1524159423000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1524160533249</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162df0c1301:449d6bd:34f43e70</id><title>Reconsidering the Nobel Prize</title><fingerprint>22a23961</fingerprint></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3196.short?rss=1</link><keywords><item>News Features, Front Matter</item></keywords><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3196.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3196.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3196</canonicalUrl><author><name>Carolyn Beans</name></author><published>1522168914000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>189</engagement><crawled>1522172947982</crawled><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/13/3196/F1.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>362</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Experiments on mice living in more natural habitats can deliver results dramatically different from those in traditional laboratories‚Äîwith profound implications for biomedical science.

Background &lt;p&gt;Agreed international development standards underpin high quality &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There is however, no international consensus on how high quality CPGs should ‚Äòlook‚Äô; or on whether high quality CPGs from one country can be viably implemented elsewhere. Writing d&lt;i&gt;e novo&lt;/i&gt; CPGs is generally resource-intensive and expensive, making this challenging in resource-poor environments. This paper proposes an alternative, efficient method of producing high quality CPGs in such circumstances, using existing CPGs layered by local knowledge, contexts and products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We undertook a mixed methods case study in South African (SA) primary healthcare (PHC), building on findings from four independent studies. These comprised an overview of international CPG activities; a rapid literature review on international CPG development practices; critical appraisal of 16 purposively-sampled SA PHC CPGs; and additional interrogation of these CPGs regarding how, why and for whom, they had been produced, and how they ‚Äòlooked‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Despite a common aim to improve SA PHC healthcare practices, the included CPGs had different, unclear and inconsistent production processes, terminology and evidence presentation styles. None aligned with international quality standards. However many included innovative succinct guidance for end-users (which we classified as evidence-based summary recommendations, patient management tools or protocols). We developed a three-tiered model, a checklist and a glossary of common terms, for more efficient future production of better quality, contextually-relevant, locally-implementable SA PHC CPGs. Tier 1 involves transparent synthesis of existing high quality CPG recommendations; Tier 2 reflects local expertise to layer Tier 1 evidence with local contexts; and Tier 3 comprises tailored locally-relevant end-user guidance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our model could be relevant for any resource-poor environment.

The results showed that the sodium caseinate concentrations, dosages of rutin and ethanol volume fractions significantly affected the zein nanoparticles‚Äô characteristics. Concerning the antioxidant properties, the highest values of rutin loaded ZP obtained using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging and 2 and 2&apos;-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) decolourisation assays were 52.7% and 71.2%, respectively, and the total antioxidant capacity was 0.40 nmol g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The co-existence of several ploidy types in natural populations makes the cyprinid loach &lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; an exciting model system to study the genetic and phenotypic consequences of ploidy variations. A first step in such effort is to identify the specific ploidy of an individual. Currently popular methods of karyotyping via cytological preparation or flow cytometry require a large amount of tissue (such as blood) samples, which can be damaging or fatal to the fishes. Here, we developed novel microsatellite markers (SSR markers) from &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; and show that they can effectively discriminate ploidy using samples collected in a minimally invasive way. Specifically, we generated whole genome transcriptomes from multiple &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; using the Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 150 million raw reads were assembled into 76,544 non-redundant unigenes. A total of 8,194 potential SSR markers were identified. We selected 98 pairs with more than five tandem repeats for further assays. Out of 45 putative EST-SSR markers that successfully amplified and harbored polymorphism in diploids, 11 markers displayed high variability in tetraploids. We further demonstrate that a set of five EST-SSR markers selected from these are sufficient to distinguish ploidy levels, by first validating them on 69 reference specimens with known ploidy levels and then subsequently using fresh-collected 96 ploidy-unknown specimens. The results from EST-SSR markers are highly concordant with those from independent flow cytometry analysis. The novel EST-SSR markers developed here should facilitate genetic studies of polyploidy in the emerging model system &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d1:9f3b30f2</id><title>Development of novel EST-SSR markers for ploidy identification based on &amp;lt;i&gt;de novo&amp;lt;/i&gt; transcriptome assembly for &amp;lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>98eba322</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bing Feng, Soojin V.

Background &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) induces a systemic inflammatory state affecting iron homeostasis. Patients with TB often have additional comorbidities such as anemia which can result in poorer treat outcomes. We studied the contribution of anemia and the role of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin among TB patients and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed serum samples from 102 TB cases and 98 controls without TB, matched by age/sex, for hepcidin, iron, and inflammation parameters. Five controls developed TB within 12 months. We used linear regression to assess associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) was more frequent among cases than controls (59.8% vs. 26.1%), but iron-deficiency anemia more frequent in controls (10% vs. 1%). The median hepcidin level was higher in cases than controls (63.7 vs. 14.2 ng/mL), but coinfections with HIV, helminths, and respiratory pathogens did not show cumulative effects. Hepcidin was associated with more severe TB symptom scoring (coefficient 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5‚Äì1.2) and higher mycobacterial load (0.7, 95% CI 0.4‚Äì1.0). Hepcidin was higher in TB cases and controls who developed TB compared to controls without TB (p&amp;lt;0.001), even when restricting to HIV-negative study participants.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;ACD was the predominate etiology in TB patients suggesting limited benefit from iron supplementation. Increased hepcidin levels long before active disease, indicating altered iron metabolism, may be a marker for developing disease among TB-exposed individuals. Clinical management of anemia and nutrition interventions in TB patients need to be considered to improve the clinical course and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fd:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Anemia in tuberculosis cases and household controls from Tanzania: Contribution of disease, coinfections, and the role of hepcidin</title><fingerprint>946dbf9a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jerry Hella, Colin I.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients‚Äô general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients‚Äô follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4612:34f43e70</id><title>Predictive value of the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in HBV-associated cirrhotic patients after splenectomy</title><fingerprint>fd6c6806</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</description></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023069?af=R</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023069?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023069?af=R</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Tianhui Liu</name></author><published>1523332815000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523690829753</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162c30cf7b9:1b85301:34f43e70</id><title>Water dissociating on rigid Ni(100): A quantum dynamics study on a full-dimensional potential energy surface</title><fingerprint>a433ad14</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195414</link><updated>1522789200000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195414</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Inam Yekwayo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195414</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195414</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1522789200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Inam Yekwayo, James S.

Fire is a major driver in many ecosystems. Yet, little is known about how different ground-living arthropods survive fire. Using three sampling methods, and time-since-fire (last fire event: 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years), we investigate how ground-living arthropod diversity responds to fire, and how species richness, diversity, abundance, and composition of the four dominant taxa: ants, beetles, cockroaches and mites, respond. We did this in the naturally fire-prone Mediterranean-type scrubland vegetation (fynbos) of the Cape Floristic Region. Surprisingly, overall species richness and diversity was the same for all time-since-fire categories. However, when each dominant taxon was analysed separately, effect of fire on species richness and abundance varied among taxa. This emphasizes that many taxa must be investigated to really understand fire-driven events. We also highlight the importance of using different diversity measures, as fire did not influence species richness and abundance of particular taxa, while it affected others, overall greatly affecting assemblages of all taxa. Rockiness affected species richness, abundance and composition of a few taxa. We found that all time-since-fire categories supported distinctive assemblages. Some indicator species occurred across all time-since-fire categories, while others were restricted to a single time-since-fire category, showing that there is a wide range of responses to fire between taxa. Details of local landscape structure, abiotic and biotic, and frequency and intensity of fire add complexity to the fire-arthropod interaction. Overall, we show that the relationship between fire and arthropods is phylogenetically constrained, having been honed by many millennia of fire events, and highly complex. Present-day species manifest a variety of adaptations for surviving the great natural selective force of fire.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f71:34f43e70</id><title>Only multi-taxon studies show the full range of arthropod responses to fire</title><fingerprint>b4de967f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inam Yekwayo, James S.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Common colds are the most frequently encountered disease worldwide and the most frequent reason for self-care. According to the cross-sectional European Common Colds study (COCO), patients use as many as 12 items on average for self-care. Little is known about the influence of discomfort and knowledge on self-care for common colds.&lt;/p&gt; Main objective &lt;p&gt;To understand the influence of patients‚Äô discomfort during a cold and their knowledge about the self-limited disease course on the use of self-care measures.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This COCO analysis included 2,204 patients from 22 European primary care sites in 12 countries. Each site surveyed 120 consecutive adults with a 27-item questionnaire asking about patients‚Äô self-care, subjective discomfort during a cold (discomfort: yes/no), and knowledge about the self-limited course (yes/no). Country-specific medians of the number of self-care items served as a cut-off to define high and low self-care use. Four groups were stratified based on discomfort (yes/no) and knowledge (yes/no).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Participants‚Äô mean age was 46.5 years, 61.7% were female; 36.3% lacked knowledge; 70.6% reported discomfort.

Background &lt;p&gt;Carriers of mutations in hereditary cancer predisposition genes represent a small but clinically important subgroup of oncology patients. The identification of causal germline mutations determines follow-up management, treatment options and genetic counselling in patients‚Äô families. Targeted next-generation sequencing-based analyses using cancer-specific panels in high-risk individuals have been rapidly adopted by diagnostic laboratories. While the use of diagnosis-specific panels is straightforward in typical cases, individuals with unusual phenotypes from families with overlapping criteria require multiple panel testing. Moreover, narrow gene panels are limited by our currently incomplete knowledge about possible genetic dispositions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We have designed a multi-gene panel called CZECANCA (CZEch CAncer paNel for Clinical Application) for a sequencing analysis of 219 cancer-susceptibility and candidate predisposition genes associated with frequent hereditary cancers.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The bioanalytical and bioinformatics pipeline was validated on a set of internal and commercially available DNA controls showing high coverage uniformity, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The panel demonstrates a reliable detection of both single nucleotide and copy number variants. Inter-laboratory, intra- and inter-run replicates confirmed the robustness of our approach.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The objective of CZECANCA is a nationwide consolidation of cancer-predisposition genetic testing across various clinical indications with savings in costs, human labor and turnaround time.

&lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of &lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

Background &lt;p&gt;New methodologies to estimate gestational age (GA) at birth are demanded to face the limited access to obstetric ultrasonography and imprecision of postnatal scores. The study analyzed the correlation between neonatal skin thickness and pregnancy duration. Secondarily, it investigated the influence of fetal growth profiles on tissue layer dimensions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;In a feasibility study, 222 infants selected at a term-to-preterm ratio of 1:1 were assessed. Reliable information on GA was based on the early ultrasonography-based reference. The thicknesses of the epidermal and dermal skin layers were examined using high-frequency ultrasonography. We scanned the skin over the forearm and foot plantar surface of the newborns. A multivariate regression model was adjusted to determine the correlation of GA with skin layer dimensions. The best model to correlate skin thickness with GA was fitted using the epidermal layer on the forearm site, adjusted to cofactors, as follows: Gestational age (weeks) = ‚àí28.0 + 12.8 &lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt; (Thickness) ‚àí 4.4 Incubator staying; &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.604 (P&amp;lt;0.001). In this model, the constant value for the standard of fetal growth was statistically null. The dermal layer thickness on the forearm and plantar surfaces had a negative moderate linear correlation with GA (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = ‚àí0.370, P&amp;lt;0.001 and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = ‚àí0.421, P&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). The univariate statistical analyses revealed the influence of underweight and overweight profiles on neonatal skin thickness at birth. Of the 222 infants, 53 (23.9%) had inappropriate fetal growths expected for their GA. Epidermal thickness was not fetal growth standard dependent as follows: 172.2 (19.8) Œºm for adequate for GA, 171.4 (20.6) Œºm for SGA, and 177.7 (15.2) Œºm for LGA (P = 0.525, mean [SD] on the forearm).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The analysis highlights a new opportunity to relate GA at birth to neonatal skin layer thickness. As this parameter was not influenced by the standard of fetal growth, skin maturity can contribute to clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae79:fc1f8953</id><title>Skin thickness as a potential marker of gestational age at birth despite different fetal growth profiles: A feasibility study</title><fingerprint>5003b2fd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriela Luiza Nogueira Vitral, Regina Am√©lia P.

The best model to correlate skin thickness with GA was fitted using the epidermal layer on the forearm site, adjusted to cofactors, as follows: Gestational age (weeks) = ‚àí28.0 + 12.8 &lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt; (Thickness) ‚àí 4.4 Incubator staying; &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.604 (P&amp;lt;0.001). In this model, the constant value for the standard of fetal growth was statistically null. The dermal layer thickness on the forearm and plantar surfaces had a negative moderate linear correlation with GA (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = ‚àí0.370, P&amp;lt;0.001 and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = ‚àí0.421, P&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). The univariate statistical analyses revealed the influence of underweight and overweight profiles on neonatal skin thickness at birth. Of the 222 infants, 53 (23.9%) had inappropriate fetal growths expected for their GA. Epidermal thickness was not fetal growth standard dependent as follows: 172.2 (19.8) Œºm for adequate for GA, 171.4 (20.6) Œºm for SGA, and 177.7 (15.2) Œºm for LGA (P = 0.525, mean [SD] on the forearm).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The analysis highlights a new opportunity to relate GA at birth to neonatal skin layer thickness. As this parameter was not influenced by the standard of fetal growth, skin maturity can contribute to clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195805</link><updated>1523912400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195805</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Erminio Bonizzoni</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195805</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195805</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1523912400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Erminio Bonizzoni, Gualberto Gussoni, Giancarlo Agnelli, Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi, Moira Bonfanti, Franco Mastroianni, Marco Candela, Carlotta Franchi, Stefania Frasson, Antonio Greco, Micaela La Regina, Roberta Re, Giorgio Vescovo, Mauro Campanini&lt;/p&gt;

Here we demonstrate the application of a method that could accelerate the development of novel therapies by allowing direct and repeatable visualization of cellular function in the living eye, to study loss of vision in animal models of retinal disease, as well as evaluate the time course of retinal function following therapeutic intervention. We use high-resolution adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy to image fluorescence from the calcium sensor GCaMP6s. In mice with photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), we measured restored visual responses in ganglion cell layer neurons expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin ChrimsonR over a six-week period following significant loss of visual responses. Combining a fluorescent calcium sensor, a channelrhodopsin, and adaptive optics enables all-optical stimulation and recording of retinal neurons in the living eye. Because the retina is an accessible portal to the central nervous system, our method also provides a novel non-invasive method of dissecting neuronal processing in the brain.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0e:7d6c1c1c</id><title>All-optical recording and stimulation of retinal neurons &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; in retinal degeneration mice</title><fingerprint>8b125121</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Soon Keen Cheong, Jennifer M.

Mutations in &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; have been implicated in several genetic disorders, particularly Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. In order to determine the most reliable bioinformatics tools to assess the likely pathogenicity of &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; variants, the results of bioinformatics predictions were compared to the impact of variants on &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; structure and function. The MutPred, Provean, and PMUT bioinformatic tools were found to have the highest performance in predicting the pathogenicity effects of all 18 characterized missense variants in &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt;, all with sensitivity and specificity &gt;93%. Applying these three programs to assess the likely pathogenicity of 13 previously uncharacterized &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; missense variants predicted 12/13 variants as deleterious, except A30V which was predicted as benign variant for all programs. Molecular modeling of the &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; homoedomain predicts that of the 31 known &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; variants, L54Q, F58L, V83F, V83L, W86C, W86S, and R91P alter PITX2‚Äôs structure. In contrast, the remaining 24 variants are not predicted to change PITX2‚Äôs structure.

However, the magnitude of the mutation-driven effects on the macromolecular network is yet to be fully explored. In this work, we present an systematic multi-level characterization of human mutations associated with genetic disorders by determining their individual and combined interaction-rewiring, edgetic, effects on the human interactome. Our in-silico analysis highlights the intrinsic differences and important similarities between the pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and frameshift mutations. We show that pathogenic SNVs are more likely to cause gene pleiotropy than pathogenic frameshift mutations and are enriched on the protein interaction interfaces. Functional profiling of SNVs indicates widespread disruption of the protein-protein interactions and synergistic effects of SNVs. The coverage of our approach is several times greater than the recently published experimental study and has the minimal overlap with it, while the distributions of determined edgotypes between the two sets of profiled mutations are remarkably similar. Case studies reveal the central role of interaction-disrupting mutations in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and suggest the importance of studying mutations that abnormally strengthen the protein interactions in cancer.

However, the magnitude of the mutation-driven effects on the macromolecular network is yet to be fully explored. In this work, we present an systematic multi-level characterization of human mutations associated with genetic disorders by determining their individual and combined interaction-rewiring, edgetic, effects on the human interactome. Our in-silico analysis highlights the intrinsic differences and important similarities between the pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and frameshift mutations. We show that pathogenic SNVs are more likely to cause gene pleiotropy than pathogenic frameshift mutations and are enriched on the protein interaction interfaces. Functional profiling of SNVs indicates widespread disruption of the protein-protein interactions and synergistic effects of SNVs. The coverage of our approach is several times greater than the recently published experimental study and has the minimal overlap with it, while the distributions of determined edgotypes between the two sets of profiled mutations are remarkably similar. Case studies reveal the central role of interaction-disrupting mutations in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and suggest the importance of studying mutations that abnormally strengthen the protein interactions in cancer. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology that drives precision medicine, there is an increasing demand in understanding the changes in molecular mechanisms caused by the patient-specific genetic variation. The current and future in-silico edgotyping tools present a cheap and fast solution to deal with the rapidly growing datasets of discovered mutations.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195022</link><updated>1522357200000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195022</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Shail M.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) are frequently exposed to computed tomography (CT). Each CT exposes patients to radiation that cumulatively could increase the risk of malignancy, particularly in younger patients. We aim to study the effect of age on CT use in IBD patients seen in the Emergency Department (ED) or the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study of IBD patients identified in Truven Health Marketscan databases between 2009‚Äì2013. The main outcome was use of CT during an ED or inpatient visit. Effect of age on CT use was characterized using logistic regression accounting for important covariables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 66,731 patients with IBD with 144,147 ED or inpatient visits in this cohort with a diagnosis code of IBD. At first visit, 5.8% percent were below age 18. CT was utilized in 26.6% of visits. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for medications, recent surgery, and gender, patients 18‚Äì35 were more likely to undergo CT (OR 2.35, 95%CI: 2.20‚Äì2.52) compared to those &amp;lt;18. Examining patients only between 16 and 19, the odds of an 18 or 19-year-old undergoing CT is significantly higher than a 16 or 17-year-old (OR 1.96, 95%CI: 1.71‚Äì2.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with IBD undergo CT more than a quarter of the time in the ED or inpatient setting. Pediatric providers limit radiation exposure among those &amp;lt;18 while adult providers are not as cautious with radiation exposure for the young adult population. Increased awareness of the risks of cumulative radiation exposure in the young adult population is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1b:7d6c1c1c</id><title>CT utilization abruptly increases at age 18 among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in the hospital</title><fingerprint>eb75d292</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shail M.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The inconclusive clinical results for ST-waveform analysis (STAN) in detecting fetal hypoxemia may be caused by the signal processing of the STAN-device itself. We assessed the performance of a clinical STAN device in signal processing and in detecting hypoxemia in a fetal sheep model exposed to prolonged umbilical cord occlusion (UCO).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight fetal lambs were exposed to 25 minutes of UCO. ECG recordings were analyzed during a baseline period and during UCO. STAN-event rates and timing of episodic T/QRS rise, baseline T/QRS rise and the occurrence of biphasic ST-waveforms, as well as signal loss, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During baseline conditions of normoxemia, a median of 40 (IQR, 25‚Äì70) STAN-events per minute were detected, compared to 10 (IQR, 2‚Äì22) during UCO. During UCO STAN-events were detected in five subjects within 10 minutes and in six subjects after 18 minutes, respectively. Two subjects did not generate any STAN-event during UCO. Biphasic ST event rate was reduced during UCO (median 0, IQR 0‚Äì5), compared to baseline (median 32, IQR, 6‚Äì55). ST-waveforms could not be assessed in 62% of the recording time during UCO, despite a good quality of the ECG signal.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The STAN device showed limitations in detecting hypoxemia in fetal sheep after prolonged UCO. The STAN device produced high false positive event rates during baseline and did not detect T/QRS changes adequately after prolonged fetal hypoxemia. During 14% of baseline and 62% of the UCO period, the STAN-device could not process the ECG signal, despite its good quality. Resolving these issues may improve the clinical performance of the STAN device.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aef:9f3b30f2</id><title>ST waveform analysis for monitoring hypoxic distress in fetal sheep after prolonged umbilical cord occlusion</title><fingerprint>be801b98</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Andriessen, Alex Zwanenburg, Judith O.

Effector domain/histone interactions have been broadly studied, but largely using peptide fragments of histone tails. Here, we extend these studies into the nucleosome context and find that the conformation adopted by the histone H3 tails is inhibitory to BPTF PHD finger binding. Using NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations, we show that the H3 tails interact robustly but dynamically with nucleosomal DNA, substantially reducing PHD finger association. Altering the electrostatics of the H3 tail via modification or mutation increases accessibility to the PHD finger, indicating that PTM crosstalk can regulate effector domain binding by altering nucleosome conformation. Together, our results demonstrate that the nucleosome context has a dramatic impact on signaling events at the histone tails, and highlights the importance of studying histone binding in the context of the nucleosome.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31481</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31481</originId><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31481</canonicalUrl><author><name>jwereszc@iit.edu (Catherine A Musselman)</name></author><published>1523491200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523534315437</crawled><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162b9b8bfad:d2f3df:7d6c1c1c</id><title>The conformation of the histone H3 tail inhibits association of the BPTF PHD finger with the nucleosome</title><fingerprint>ce80d805</fingerprint><description>Histone tails harbor a plethora of post-translational modifications that direct the function of chromatin regulators, which recognize them through effector domains. Effector domain/histone interactions have been broadly studied, but largely using peptide fragments of histone tails. Here, we extend these studies into the nucleosome context and find that the conformation adopted by the histone H3 tails is inhibitory to BPTF PHD finger binding. Using NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations, we show that the H3 tails interact robustly but dynamically with nucleosomal DNA, substantially reducing PHD finger association.

Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of built-up areas for a wide range of applications. Recently developed approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of built-up areas using road network data. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard to different administrative regions and cities/towns.

Some epidemiological studies indicate that the use of mobile phones causes cancer in humans (in particular glioblastomas). It is known that DNA damage plays a key role in malignant transformation; therefore, we investigated the impact of the UMTS signal which is widely used in mobile telecommunications, on DNA stability in ten different human cell lines (six brain derived cell lines, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, liver and buccal tissue derived cells) under conditions relevant for users (SAR 0.25 to 1.00 W/kg). We found no evidence for induction of damage in single cell gel electrophoresis assays when the cells were cultivated with serum. However, clear positive effects were seen in a p53 proficient glioblastoma line (U87) when the cells were grown under serum free conditions, while no effects were found in p53 deficient glioblastoma cells (U251).

Some epidemiological studies indicate that the use of mobile phones causes cancer in humans (in particular glioblastomas). It is known that DNA damage plays a key role in malignant transformation; therefore, we investigated the impact of the UMTS signal which is widely used in mobile telecommunications, on DNA stability in ten different human cell lines (six brain derived cell lines, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, liver and buccal tissue derived cells) under conditions relevant for users (SAR 0.25 to 1.00 W/kg). We found no evidence for induction of damage in single cell gel electrophoresis assays when the cells were cultivated with serum. However, clear positive effects were seen in a p53 proficient glioblastoma line (U87) when the cells were grown under serum free conditions, while no effects were found in p53 deficient glioblastoma cells (U251). Further experiments showed that the damage disappears rapidly in U87 and that exposure induced nucleotide excision repair (NER) and does not cause double strand breaks (DSBs). The observation of NER induction is supported by results of a proteome analysis indicating that several proteins involved in NER are up-regulated after exposure to UMTS; additionally, we found limited evidence for the activation of the Œ≥-interferon pathway. The present findings show that the signal causes transient genetic instability in glioma derived cells and activates cellular defense systems.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195188</link><updated>1522962000000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195188</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Santiago Alonso-Diaz</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195188</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195188</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1522962000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Santiago Alonso-Diaz, Jessica F.

A dominant mechanism in the Judgment and Decision Making literature states that information is accumulated about each choice option until a decision threshold is met. Only after that threshold does a subject start to execute a motor response to indicate their choice. However, recent research has revealed spatial gradients in motor responses as a function of comparison difficulty as well as changes-of-mind in the middle of an action, both suggesting continued accumulation and processing of decision-related signals after the decision boundary. Here we present a formal model and supporting data from a number comparison task that a continuous motor planner, combined with a simple statistical inference scheme, can model detailed behavioral effects without assuming a threshold. This threshold-free model reproduces subjects‚Äô sensitivity to numerical distance in reaching, accuracy, reaction time, and changes of mind. We argue that the motor system positions the effectors using an optimal biomechanical feedback controller, and continuous statistical inference on outputs from cognitive processes.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4600:34f43e70</id><title>A threshold-free model of numerosity comparisons</title><fingerprint>5f69c1c2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Santiago Alonso-Diaz, Jessica F.

The Service is divided into a clinic (SIS-C) where all referred children undergo a pre-vaccination visit and an area within the Pediatric Emergency Department (SIS-PED) where children are vaccinated if indicated.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ‚â§ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ‚â• 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef14:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review</title><fingerprint>30b1893b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica L.

E487K point mutation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 (ALDH2*2) in East Asians intrinsically lowers ALDH2 activity. ALDH2*2 is associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic patients exhibit heart failure of preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) i.e. while the systolic heart function is preserved in them, they may exhibit diastolic dysfunction, implying a jeopardized myocardial health. Currently, it is challenging to detect cardiac functional deterioration in diabetic mice. Stress echocardiography (echo) in the clinical set-up is a procedure used to measure cardiac reserve and impaired cardiac function in coronary artery diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that high-fat diet fed type-2 diabetic ALDH2*2 mutant mice exhibit HFpEF which can be measured by cardiac echo stress test methodology. We induced type-2 diabetes in 12-week-old male C57BL/6 and ALDH2*2 mice through a high-fat diet. At the end of 4 months of DM induction, we measured the cardiac function in diabetic and control mice of C57BL/6 and ALDH2*2 genotypes by conscious echo. Subsequently, we imposed exercise stress by allowing the mice to run on the treadmill until exhaustion. Post-stress, we measured their cardiac function again. Only after treadmill running, but not at rest, we found a significant decrease in % fractional shortening and % ejection fraction in ALDH2*2 mice with diabetes compared to C57BL/6 diabetic mice as well as non-diabetic (control) ALDH2*2 mice. The diabetic ALDH2*2 mice also exhibited poor maximal running speed and distance. Our data suggest that high-fat fed diabetic ALDH2*2 mice exhibit HFpEF and treadmill exercise stress echo test is able to determine this HFpEF in the diabetic ALDH2*2 mice.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f9:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Type-2 diabetic aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 mutant mice (ALDH 2*2) exhibiting heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype can be determined by exercise stress echocardiography</title><fingerprint>7fac5fb7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guodong Pan, Srikar Munukutla, Ananya Kar, Joseph Gardinier, Rajarajan A.

Scant research is available on the impact of the current economic crisis and austerity policies on inequality in health services utilisation in Europe. This study aimed to describe the trends in horizontal inequity in the use of health services in Andalusia, Spain, during the early years of the Great Recession, and the contribution of demographic, economic and social factors. Consultation with a general practitioner (GP) and specialist, hospitalisation and emergency care were studied through the Andalusian Health Survey 2007 (pre-crisis) and 2011‚Äì2012 (crisis), using a composite income index as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. Horizontal inequity indices (HII) were calculated to take differential healthcare needs into account, and a decomposition analysis of change in inequality between periods was performed. Results showed that before the crisis, the HII was positive (greater access for people with higher SES) for specialist visits but negative (greater access for people with lower SES) in the other three utilisation models. During the crisis no change was observed in inequalities in GP visits, but a pro-poor development was seen for the other types of utilisation, with hospital and emergency care showing significant inequality in favour of low income groups. Overall, the main contributors to pro-poor changes in utilisation were socio-economic variables and poor mental health, due to changes in their elasticities. Our findings show that inequalities in healthcare utilisation largely remained in favour of the less well-off, despite the cuts in welfare benefits and health services provision during the early years of the recession in Andalusia. Further research is needed to monitor the potential impact of such measures in subsequent years.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c5a:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Withstanding austerity: Equity in health services utilisation in the first stage of the economic recession in Southern Spain</title><fingerprint>d99bca9c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Antonio C√≥rdoba-Do√±a, Antonio Escolar-Pujolar, Miguel San Sebasti√°n, Per E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta‚Äìanalysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords ‚Äúdiabetes‚Äù AND (‚Äúheart rate variability‚Äù OR ‚ÄúHRV‚Äù). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter‚Äìelectrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR‚Äìintervals (or Normal to Normal intervals‚ÄîNN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR‚Äìintervals (effect size = ‚Äì0.61; 95%CI ‚Äì1.21 to ‚Äì0.01), lower SDNN (‚Äì0.65; ‚Äì0.83 to ‚Äì0.47), lower RMSSD (‚Äì0.92; ‚Äì1.37 to ‚Äì0.47), lower pNN50 (‚Äì0.46; ‚Äì0.84 to ‚Äì0.09), lower total power (‚Äì1.52; ‚Äì2.13 to ‚Äì0.91), lower LF (‚Äì1.08; ‚Äì1.46 to ‚Äì0.69]), and lower HF (‚Äì0.79; ‚Äì1.09 to ‚Äì0.50). LF/HF did not differ between groups. Levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were associated with several HRV parameters, as well as Time from diagnosis of T2DM&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;T2DM was associated with an overall decrease in the HRV of T2DM patients. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity were decreased, which can be explained by the deleterious effects of altered glucose metabolism on HRV, leading to cardiac autonomic neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76926:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Heart rate variability in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta‚Äìanalysis</title><fingerprint>4a033e47</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Benichou, Bruno Pereira, Martial Mermillod, Igor Tauveron, Daniela Pfabigan, Salwan Maqdasy, Fr√©d√©ric Dutheil&lt;/p&gt;

The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and its version for groups (TSST-G) are the gold standard for inducing acute psychosocial stress in human experimental settings and have been used in numerous studies since the early 1990s. The TSST and the TSST-G lead to effects on different physiological and psychological markers, such as salivary cortisol, anxiety, and emotional states. These effects were assessed with quantitative methods comparing pre-test and post-test measures with statistical analyses. But to date, no qualitative analyses have been conducted to examine the meaningful experience of participants during the TSST and the TSST-G. This study is the first to conduct qualitative investigations to further clarify the stressful experience of participants confronted with these procedures. Preliminary results showed as expected that the TSST and the TSST-G effectively induced psychosocial stress, with cortisol levels, cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and arousal increases, and with pleasure and dominance decreases. At the qualitative level, the results evidenced that the two theoretically stressful components of the TSST and the TSST-G, namely social-evaluative threat and uncontrollability, were experienced as stress-inducing by the participants. Two case studies confirmed these findings. But the results also showed on one hand that psychosocial stress is a dynamic phenomenon, with important fluctuations throughout the tasks (mainly for the TSST-G); and on the other hand that despite the similar physiological and psychological responses between the TSST and the TSST-G evidenced by the literature, the experience of the participants was both similar and specific. Use of a qualitative method allowed us to provide a complementary point of view to understand the meaningful experience of participants during these stressful procedures, apprehending the dynamic of the subjective stress experience without disrupting it.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d0:34f43e70</id><title>The Trier Social Stress Test and the Trier Social Stress Test for groups: Qualitative investigations</title><fingerprint>88cbcef6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olivier Vors, Tanguy Marqueste, Nicolas Mascret&lt;/p&gt;

In the event of an incident involving the release of a hazardous chemical, first responders may decide to initiate emergency decontamination in order to remove any contaminant from affected casualties. Recent initiatives such as the UK Home Office-led Initial Operational Response Programme have introduced new evidence-based decontamination protocols that reduce the time taken to initiate the decontamination process, including an increased emphasis on rapidly removing contaminated clothing (disrobe), and the use of improvised dry decontamination methods. The current study used a series of focus groups to examine public perceptions of different decontamination interventions and responder management strategies. Results revealed that a decontamination shower was perceived to be more effective than dry decontamination methods and that a management strategy that included effective responder communication resulted in increased willingness to comply with the need for decontamination. This study demonstrates that public understanding and acceptance of novel decontamination methods such as dry decontamination may present additional challenges for first responders. Increased emphasis on effective communication during decontamination is needed. Furthermore, provision of information during the focus group study resulted in an increase in participants‚Äô knowledge and confidence in taking recommended decontamination actions, which was maintained three months after the study. The longitudinal nature of these effects suggest that it may be possible to increase public awareness about actions to take during chemical incidents by developing pre-incident public education; however, further research is needed to examine this more fully.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793639:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Public perceptions of emergency decontamination: Effects of intervention type and responder management strategy during a focus group study</title><fingerprint>45fe5312</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Holly Carter, Dale Weston, Naomi Betts, Simon Wilkinson, Richard Aml√¥t&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Unstable conditions of the craniocervical junction such as atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) or atlanto-axial instability (AAI) are severe injuries with a high risk of tetraplegia or death. Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown.The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system.In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9¬∞ of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement. In case of unstable craniocervical junction, this leads to a dural sac compression and thus to possible damage to the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd06f:7c9981b6</id><title>Motion and dural sac compression in the upper cervical spine during the application of a cervical collar in case of unstable craniocervical junction‚ÄîA study in two new cadaveric trauma models</title><fingerprint>4ad99bdb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiyao Liao, Niko R.

Animal welfare requires the adequate housing of animals to ensure health and well-being. The application of environmental enrichment is a way to improve the well-being of laboratory animals. However, it is important to know whether these enrichment items can be incorporated in experimental mouse husbandry without creating a divide between past and future experimental results. Previous small-scale studies have been inconsistent throughout the literature, and it is not yet completely understood whether and how enrichment might endanger comparability of results of scientific experiments. Here, we measured the effect on means and variability of 164 physiological parameters in 3 conditions: with nesting material with or without a shelter, comparing these 2 conditions to a ‚Äúbarren‚Äù regime without any enrichments. We studied a total of 360 mice from each of 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6NTac and DBA/2NCrl) and both sexes for each of the 3 conditions. Our study indicates that enrichment affects the mean values of some of the 164 parameters with no consistent effects on variability. However, the influence of enrichment appears negligible compared to the effects of other influencing factors. Therefore, nesting material and shelters may be used to improve animal welfare without impairment of experimental outcome or loss of comparability to previous data collected under barren housing conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Dd6wtkaJG8Q&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162cf7703c6:e8c8c5:76251cdd</id><title>Laboratory mouse housing conditions can be improved using common environmental enrichment without compromising data</title><fingerprint>39fd180a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viola Andr√©, Christine Gau, Angelika Scheideler, Juan A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with endplate degeneration and the association between cartilaginous fragments and inflammatory response to the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Summary of background data &lt;p&gt;LDH often involves hyaline cartilage fragments pulled from the vertebral endplates. Modic changes are closely associated with LDH that contains hyaline cartilage, and cartilaginous endplates seem to affect resorption of the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 78 patients who underwent microscopic discectomy between 9 and 16 weeks after an occurrence of LDH were reviewed. Modic changes, disc degeneration, high-intensity zone, and vertebral corner defect were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histopathological observations of cartilaginous endplates and inflamed granulation tissue in the herniated disc were made. In cases with inflamed granulation tissue, neovascularization and macrophage infiltration were also evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Modic changes were observed in approximately one-third of the patients (26 cases: type 1, 7; type 2, 17; and type 3, 2). Cartilaginous endplates were observed in 32 cases (41%) and in the majority of cases with Modic changes compared with cases without Modic changes (65%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). Although inflamed granulation tissue was observed in 60 cases (77%), no significant differences were detected in patient age and the composition of the herniated material. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that fewer CD34-positive capillaries and CD68-positive cells were found in cases with cartilaginous fragments compared with those without cartilaginous fragments (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In addition, a higher immunoreactivity to CD34 and CD68 was found in herniated discs &amp;lt;25% of whose area was occupied by cartilaginous endplates compared with discs whose area was occupied at 25% or more (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;There is an association between LDH with endplate degeneration and cartilaginous herniation, with Modic type 2 predominating.

Increased production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their widespread application in industrial and consumer products have led to a rise in the release of CNTs into the aquatic environment. CNTs have a very strong adsorption affinity for various environmental contaminants; therefore, they may also influence the toxic effects of other pollutants, such as toxic metals. In this study, the effect of two different functionalized carbon nanotubes, carboxylate and polyethyleneimine modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (C-MWCNTs and N-MWCNT, respectively) on lead toxicity and bioaccumulation was investigated with a freshwater zooplankton &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt;. The acute toxicity results indicate that the different surface properties of the two types of MWCNTs have different effects on lead toxicity to &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magna&lt;/i&gt;. The negatively charged C-MWCNT showed a notable decrease in lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.08 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; C-MWCNT), whereas the positively charged N-MWCNT had only a slight effect on lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.16 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; N-MWCNT). The decrease of lead toxicity was related with the reduced bioavailability of free metal form (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) caused by greater adsorption of lead onto the MWCNTs. The present study suggests that there is a need to consider carefully the complex interaction of CNTs with toxic metals in future ecotoxicological studies.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0c:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Effects of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes on toxicity and bioaccumulation of lead in &amp;lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>d544b27b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Min-Hee Jang, Yu Sik Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30‚Äì59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ¬± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ¬± 14.6 and 49.2 ¬± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ¬±10.5 and 34.8 ¬±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact.

We apply Loter to individuals resulting from admixture between Populus trichocarpa and Populus balsamifera and lengths of ancestry tracts indicate that admixture took place around 100 generations ago.

During the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century the discussion on early human behavioral patterns revolved around the &lt;i&gt;hunting versus scavenging&lt;/i&gt; debate. The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks‚Äì 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores‚Äìwere virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2819:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Differentiating percussion pits and carnivore tooth pits using 3D reconstructions and geometric morphometrics</title><fingerprint>a2c9073e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jos√© Yravedra, Julia Aramendi, Miguel √Ångel Mat√©-Gonz√°lez, Lloyd Austin Courtenay, Diego Gonz√°lez-Aguilera&lt;/p&gt;

Both stem cell therapy and physical treatments have been shown to be beneficial in accelerating bone healing. However, the efficacy of combined treatment with stem cells and physical stimuli for large bone defects remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone regeneration effects of low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) and human adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) treatments during fracture repair using a comparative rat calvarial defect model. We evaluated the viability of human ADSCs, which were cultured on a porous PLGA scaffold using an MTS assay. The critical-sized calvarial bone defect rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPLI group, ADSC group, and ADSC+LPLI group. Bone formation was evaluated using micro-CT. New bone formation areas and osteogenic factor expression levels were then examined by histomorphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Our data showed that PLGA had no cytotoxic effect on human ADSCs. Micro-CT analyses revealed that both the LPLI and ADSC groups showed improved calvarial bone defect healing compared to the control group. In addition, the ADSC+LPLI group showed significantly increased bone volume at 16 weeks after surgery. The area of new bone formation ranked as follows: control group &amp;lt; LPLI group &amp;lt; ADSC group &amp;lt; ADSC+LPLI group. There were significant differences between the groups. In addition, both ADSC and ADSC+LPLI groups showed strong signals of vWF expression. ADSC and LPLI treatments improved fracture repair in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats. Importantly, the combined treatment of ADSCs and LPLI further enhances the bone healing process.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4613:34f43e70</id><title>Low power laser irradiation and human adipose-derived stem cell treatments promote bone regeneration in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats</title><fingerprint>3df21530</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yan-Hsiung Wang, Jyun-Yi Wu, Su Chii Kong, Min-Hsuan Chiang, Mei-Ling Ho, Ming-Long Yeh, Chia-Hsin Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Our study addresses how environmental variables, such as macronutrients concentrations, snow cover, carbonate chemistry and salinity affect the photophysiology and biomass of Antarctic sea-ice algae. We have measured vertical profiles of inorganic macronutrients (phosphate, nitrite + nitrate and silicic acid) in summer sea ice and photophysiology of ice algal assemblages in the poorly studied Amundsen and Ross Seas sectors of the Southern Ocean. Brine-scaled bacterial abundance, chl &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and macronutrient concentrations were often high in the ice and positively correlated with each other. Analysis of photosystem II rapid light curves showed that microalgal cells in samples with high phosphate and nitrite + nitrate concentrations had reduced maximum relative electron transport rate and photosynthetic efficiency. We also observed strong couplings of PSII parameters to snow depth, ice thickness and brine salinity, which highlights a wide range of photoacclimation in Antarctic pack-ice algae. It is likely that the pack ice was in a post-bloom situation during the late sea-ice season, with low photosynthetic efficiency and a high degree of nutrient accumulation occurring in the ice. In order to predict how key biogeochemical processes are affected by future changes in sea ice cover, such as &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; photosynthesis and nutrient cycling, we need to understand how physicochemical properties of sea ice affect the microbial community. Our results support existing hypothesis about sea-ice algal photophysiology, and provide additional observations on high nutrient concentrations in sea ice that could influence the planktonic communities as the ice is retreating.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b5:9aea0a7d</id><title>Microalgal photophysiology and macronutrient distribution in summer sea ice in the Amundsen and Ross Seas, Antarctica</title><fingerprint>7b493645</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anders Torstensson, Agneta Fransson, Kim Currie, Angela Wulff, Melissa Chierici&lt;/p&gt;

Our results support existing hypothesis about sea-ice algal photophysiology, and provide additional observations on high nutrient concentrations in sea ice that could influence the planktonic communities as the ice is retreating.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195630</link><updated>1523048400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195630</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Pengwu Zhao</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195630</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195630</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1523048400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pengwu Zhao, Chongyang Xu, Mei Zhou, Bo Zhang, Peng Ge, Nan Zeng, Hongyan Liu&lt;/p&gt;
Worldwide tree mortality as induced by climate change presents a challenge to forest managers. To successfully manage vulnerable forests requires the capacity of regeneration to compensate for losses from tree mortality. We observed rapid regeneration and the growth release of young trees after warming-induced mortality in a David aspen-dominated (&lt;i&gt;Populus davidiana&lt;/i&gt;) broad-leaved forest in Inner Mongolia, China, as based on individual tree measurements taken in 2012 and 2015 from a 6-ha permanent plot. Warming and drought stress killed large trees 10‚Äì15 m tall with a total number of 2881 trees during 2011‚Äì2012, and also thinned the upper crowns. David aspen recruitment increased 2 times during 2012‚Äì2015 and resulted in a high transition probability of David aspen replacing the same or other species, whereas the recruitment of Mongolian oak (&lt;i&gt;Quercus mongolica&lt;/i&gt;) was much lower: it decreased from 2012 to 2015, indicating that rapid regeneration represented a regrowth phase for David aspen, and not succession to Mongolian oak. Further, we found that the recruitment density increased with canopy openness, thus implying that warming-induced mortality enhanced regeneration. Our results suggest that David aspen has a high regrowth ability to offset individual losses from warming-induced mortality. This important insight has implications for managing this vulnerable forest in the semi-arid region of northern China.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd086:7c9981b6</id><title>Rapid regeneration offsets losses from warming-induced tree mortality in an aspen-dominated broad-leaved forest in northern China</title><fingerprint>277386ff</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pengwu Zhao, Chongyang Xu, Mei Zhou, Bo Zhang, Peng Ge, Nan Zeng, Hongyan Liu&lt;/p&gt;

The present study aimed to explore how state self-control influences the intertemporal decisions made by individuals with high and low trait self-control. State self-control, represented by the degree of depletion, was manipulated by conducting Stroop tasks with different levels of difficulty, and the intertemporal decision task was used as a self-control task. Compared with participants with high trait self-control, the preferences of participants with low trait self-control for immediate rewards were more vulnerable to the difficulty of depletion tasks. Throughout the experimental stages, the heart rate variability (HRV) of participants with high trait self-control was significantly higher than that of participants with low trait self-control, indicating that individuals with high trait self-control may have stronger and more stable self-control abilities.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f69:34f43e70</id><title>The effect of state self-control on the intertemporal decisions made by individuals with high and low trait self-control</title><fingerprint>a0e64413</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Guan, Jiamei He&lt;/p&gt;

The natural alkaloid berberine has been ascribed numerous health benefits including lipid and cholesterol reduction and improved insulin sensitivity in diabetics. However, oral (PO) administration of berberine is hindered by poor bioavailability and increasing dose often elicits gastro-intestinal side effects. To overcome the caveats associated with oral berberine, we developed transdermal (TD) formulations of berberine (BBR) and the berberine precursor dihydroberberine (DHB). These formulations were compared to oral BBR using pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and general safety studies &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To complete this work, a sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated according the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods to simultaneously measure berberine, simvastatin, and simvastatin hydroxy acid with relative quantification used for the berberine metabolite demethylene berberine glucuronide (DBG). Acute pharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated a statistically relevant ranking for berberine bioavailability based upon AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-8&lt;/sub&gt; as DHB TD &gt; BBR TD &gt;&gt; BBR PO with similar ranking for the metabolite DBG, indicating that transdermal administration achieves BBR levels well above oral administration. Similarly, chronic administration (14 days) resulted in significantly higher levels of circulating BBR and DBG in DHB TD treated animals. Chronically treated rats were given a single dose of simvastatin with no observed change in the drugs bioavailability compared with control, suggesting the increased presence of BBR had no effect on simvastatin metabolism. This observation was further supported by consistent CYP3A4 expression across all treatment groups. Moreover, no changes in kidney and liver biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, were observed between treatment formats, and confirming previous reports that BBR has no effect on HMG-CoA expression. This study supports the safe use of transdermal compositions that improve on the poor bioavailability of oral berberine and have the potential to be more efficacious in the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0ae6:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Comparative pharmacokinetics and safety assessment of transdermal berberine and dihydroberberine</title><fingerprint>2548997e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beth Buchanan, Qingfang Meng, Mathieu-Marc Poulin, Jonathan Zuccolo, Chike Godwin Azike, Joseph Gabriele, David Charles Baranowski&lt;/p&gt;

The understanding on the roles of obesity and lifestyle behaviors in predicting executive function of adolescents has been limited. Low executive function proficiency may have adverse effects on adolescents‚Äô school academic performance. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between BMI-for-age and multiple lifestyle behaviors (operationalized as meal consumption, physical activity, and sleep quality) with executive function (operationalized as inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) on a sample of Malaysian adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 513). Participants were recruited from two randomly selected schools in the state of Selangor in Malaysia. Using a self-administered questionnaire, parent participants provided information concerning their sociodemographic data, whereas adolescent participants provided information regarding their meal consumptions, physical activity, and sleep quality. The modified Harvard step test was used to assess adolescents‚Äô aerobic fitness, while Stroop color-word, digit span, and trail-making tests were used to assess adolescents‚Äô inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, respectively. Three separate hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for each outcome namely, inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. After adjusted for sociodemographic factors and BMI-for-age, differential predictors of inhibition and working memory were found. Habitual sleep efficiency significantly and positively predicted inhibition. Regular dinner intakes, physical activity levels, and sleep quality significantly and positively predicted working memory. Household income emerged as a consistent predictor for all executive function domains. In conclusion, an increased trend of obesity and unhealthy lifestyles among adolescents were found to be associated with poorer executive function. Regular dinner intakes, higher physical activity levels and better sleep quality predicted better executive function despite the inverse relationship between obesity and executive function. Future studies may explore how lifestyle modifications can optimize the development of executive function in adolescents as well as relieve the burden of obesity.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334415a:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Obesity and unhealthy lifestyle associated with poor executive function among Malaysian adolescents</title><fingerprint>dac795ec</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joyce Ying Hui Tee, Wan Ying Gan, Kit-Aun Tan, Yit Siew Chin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Talaromyces&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Penicillium&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; is a thermally dimorphic fungus that can cause opportunistic systemic mycoses in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It has also been reported among patients with other causes of immunodeficiency, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer, organ transplanted patients receiving immunosuppressive drug and adult onset immunodeficiency syndromes. Recent studies indicate that the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and treatment strategies of talaromycosis (penicilliosis) marneffei are different between patients with and without HIV infection. Therefore early and accurate diagnosis of talaromycosis marneffei is crucial to the proper management and treatment. Since current diagnostic methods are currently inadequate, the aim of this study was to develop an immunochromatographic test (ICT) for the detection of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; yeast antigens in urine samples. The highly &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei-&lt;/i&gt;specific monoclonal antibody 4D1 (MAb 4D1) conjugated with gold colloid at pH 6.5 was used as signal generator. The nitrocellulose membrane was lined with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; cytoplasmic yeast antigen (TM CYA) to serve as the test line, and rabbit anti-mouse IgG was the control line. Subjecting the assembled test strip to urine samples containing &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; antigen produced a visible result within 20 minutes. The sensitivity limit of the assay was 3.125Œºg/ml of TM CYA. The ICT was used to test urine samples from 66 patients with blood culture confirmed talaromycosis marneffei, 42 patients with other fungal or bacterial infections, and 70 normal healthy individuals from endemic area of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt;. The test exhibited sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 87.87%, 100% and 95.5%, respectively.

Several studies highlighted the relevance of extrinsic noise in shaping cell decision making and differentiation in molecular networks. Bimodal distributions of gene expression levels provide experimental evidence of phenotypic differentiation, where the modes of the distribution often correspond to different physiological states of the system. We theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this interaction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target transcription rate almost no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We investigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a fluctuating miRNA-transcription rate. We find that the presence of extrinsic noise favours the presence of bimodal target distributions which can be observed for a wider range of parameters compared to the case with intrinsic noise only and for lower miRNA-target interaction strength. Our results suggest that combining threshold-inducing interactions with extrinsic noise provides a simple and robust mechanism for obtaining bimodal populations without requiring fine tuning. Furthermore, we characterise the protein distribution‚Äôs dependence on protein half-life.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kcCJaIvDnzk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d4ba762b:4bed5c:bdf8aaf1</id><title>On the role of extrinsic noise in microRNA-mediated bimodal gene expression</title><fingerprint>c8b72dbc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Del Giudice, Stefano Bo, Silvia Grigolon, Carla Bosia&lt;/p&gt;
Several studies highlighted the relevance of extrinsic noise in shaping cell decision making and differentiation in molecular networks. Bimodal distributions of gene expression levels provide experimental evidence of phenotypic differentiation, where the modes of the distribution often correspond to different physiological states of the system. We theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation.

Activation of the amino acid starvation response (AAR) increases lifespan and acute stress resistance as well as regulates inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of AAR pharmacologically by Halofuginone (HF) significantly inhibits production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤) and provides protection from intestinal inflammation in mice. HF inhibits IL-1Œ≤ through general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2)‚Äìdependent activation of the cytoprotective integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, resulting in rerouting of IL-1Œ≤ mRNA from translationally active polysomes to inactive ribocluster complexes‚Äîsuch as stress granules (SGs)‚Äîvia recruitment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) T cell‚Äìrestricted intracellular antigen-1(TIA-1)/TIA-1‚Äìrelated (TIAR), which are further cleared through induction of autophagy. GCN2 ablation resulted in reduced autophagy and SG formation, which is inversely correlated with IL-1Œ≤ production. Furthermore, HF diminishes inflammasome activation through suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which IL-1Œ≤ is regulated by AAR and further suggests that administration of HF might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AhBKSDqeXkQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e8:76251cdd</id><title>Amino acid starvation sensing dampens IL-1Œ≤ production by activating riboclustering and autophagy</title><fingerprint>d1fa6099</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Srikanth Battu, Sumbul Afroz, Jeevan Giddaluru, Saima Naz, Weishan Huang, Saratchandra Singh Khumukcham, Rafiq Ahmad Khan, Saleem Yousuf Bhat, Insaf Ahmed Qureshi, Bramanandam Manavathi, Aleem Ahmed Khan, Avery August, Seyed Ehtesham Hasnain, Nooruddin Khan&lt;/p&gt;

Anthocyanins are naturally active substances. In this study, anthocyanins from black rice were obtained by membrane filtration and column chromatography separation. Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products. After anaerobic incubation at 37 ¬∞C for 48 h, not only the pH of the media containing C3G was lower than that of the extract of black rice anthocyanin (BRAE), but the numbers of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were also significantly increased. Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a5:9aea0a7d</id><title>Metabolism and prebiotics activity of anthocyanins from black rice (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.) &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>7673a56e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yongsheng Zhu, Hanju Sun, Shudong He, Qiuyan Lou, Min Yu, Mingming Tang, Lijun Tu&lt;/p&gt;

The study of visual perception has largely been completed without regard to the influence that an individual‚Äôs emotional status may have on their performance in visual tasks. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that mood may affect not only creative abilities and interpersonal skills but also the capacity to perform low-level cognitive tasks. Here, we sought to determine whether rudimentary visual search processes are similarly affected by emotion. Specifically, we examined whether an individual‚Äôs perceived happiness level affects their ability to detect a target in noise. To do so, we employed pop-out and serial visual search paradigms, implemented using a novel smartphone application that allowed search times and self-rated levels of happiness to be recorded throughout each twenty-four-hour period for two weeks. This experience sampling protocol circumvented the need to alter mood artificially with laboratory-based induction methods. Using our smartphone application, we were able to replicate the classic visual search findings, whereby pop-out search times remained largely unaffected by the number of distractors whereas serial search times increased with increasing number of distractors. While pop-out search times were unaffected by happiness level, serial search times with the maximum numbers of distractors (n = 30) were significantly faster for high happiness levels than low happiness levels (p = 0.02). Our results demonstrate the utility of smartphone applications in assessing ecologically valid measures of human visual performance. We discuss the significance of our findings for the assessment of basic visual functions using search time measures, and for our ability to search effectively for targets in real world settings.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344158:7d6c1c1c</id><title>The effect of mood state on visual search times for detecting a target in noise: An application of smartphone technology</title><fingerprint>1ceb0ce8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Toru Maekawa, Stephen J.

&lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; plays a significant role in the oligotrophic oceans, fixing nitrogen in an area corresponding to half of the Earth‚Äôs surface, representing up to 50% of new production in some oligotrophic tropical and subtropical oceans. Whilst &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; blooms at the surface exhibit a strong dependence on diazotrophy, colonies at depth or at the surface after a mixing event could be utilising additional N-sources. We conducted experiments to establish how acclimation to varying N-sources affects the growth, elemental composition, light absorption coefficient, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation, PSII electron transport rate and the relationship between net and gross photosynthetic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;erythraeum&lt;/i&gt; IMS101. To do this, cultures were acclimated to growth medium containing NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (replete concentrations) or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only (diazotrophic control). The light dependencies of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake were measured using membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS), while PSII electron transport rates were measured from fluorescence light curves (FLCs). We found that at a saturating light intensity, &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; growth was ~ 10% and 13% lower when grown on N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Oxygen uptake increased linearly with net photosynthesis across all light intensities ranging from darkness to 1100 Œºmol photons m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The maximum rates and initial slopes of light response curves for C-specific gross and net photosynthesis and the slope of the relationship between gross and net photosynthesis increased significantly under non-diazotrophic conditions. We attribute these observations to a reduced expenditure of reductant and ATP for nitrogenase activity under non-diazotrophic conditions which allows NADPH and ATP to be re-directed to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation and/or biosynthesis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease and one of the leading causes of disability in young adults. Functional markers able to predict MS progression are still lacking. It is recognized that olfactory dysfunction may be an early symptom in MS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether alterations in olfactory event-related potentials could play a prognostic role in MS. Thirty patients affected by MS relapsing-remitting underwent an olfactory potential examination (T0). Three years after baseline (T1), 28 of 30 patients were clinically evaluated by expanded disability status scale. In addition, the number of Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) and the total number of relapses occurred in the last 3 years were collected. At T1, we observed a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and expanded disability status scale scores (rpb = -0.48; p = 0.009). A significant trend for a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and disease duration (rpb = -0.36; p = 0.06) and total number of relapses (rpb = -0.34; p = 0.08) was found. Only patients with olfactory potential absence showed a significant trend in the difference of the disability status scale (p = 0.06) between T0 and T1. In the sub-group of patients with reduced olfactory potential amplitude, we detected a trend for a negative correlation between the disability status scale and the amplitude of N1-P2 components more marked at T1 (r = -0.52; p = 0.06) than T0 (r = -0.47; p = 0.09). This is the first study that evaluated the prognostic role of olfactory event-related potentials in MS. Our results highlighted that olfactory alterations of MS patients were related to disability progression and, to a lesser extent, disease activity. The analysis of olfactory potential parameters confirmed the involvement in olfactory network damage of inflammatory and/or neurodegeneration processes which could predict the progressive course of the disease.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344161:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Olfactory dysfunction as a prognostic marker for disability progression in Multiple Sclerosis: An olfactory event related potential study</title><fingerprint>5330c3de</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rosella Ciurleo, Lilla Bonanno, Simona De Salvo, Laura Romeo, Carmela Rifici, Edoardo Sessa, Giangaetano D‚ÄôAleo, Margherita Russo, Placido Bramanti, Silvia Marino, Fabrizia Caminiti&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Weekends off antiretroviral therapy (ART) may help engage HIV-1-infected young people facing lifelong treatment. BREATHER showed short cycle therapy (SCT; 5 days on, 2 days off ART) was non-inferior to continuous therapy (CT) over 48 weeks. Planned follow-up was extended to 144 weeks, maintaining original randomisation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;BREATHER was an open-label, non-inferiority trial. Participants aged 8-24yrs with virological suppression on efavirenz-based first-line ART were randomised 1:1, stratified by age and African/non-African sites, to remain on CT or change to SCT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the proportion of participants with viral rebound (confirmed VL‚â•50 copies/mL) under intent-to-treat at 48 weeks (primary outcome), and in extended follow-up at 96, 144, and 192 weeks. SCT participants returned to CT following viral rebound, 3 VL blips or discontinuation of efavirenz.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of 199 participants (99 SCT, 100 CT), 97 per arm consented to extended follow-up. Median follow-up was 185.3 weeks (IQR 160.9‚Äì216.1). 69 (70%) SCT participants remained on SCT at last follow-up. 105 (53%) were male, baseline median age 14 years (IQR 12‚Äì18), median CD4 count 735 cells/ŒºL (IQR 576‚Äì968). 16 SCT and 16 CT participants had confirmed VL‚â•50 copies/mL by the end of extended follow-up (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50‚Äì2.00). Estimated difference in percentage with viral rebound (SCT minus CT) by week 144 was 1.9% (90% CI -6.6‚Äì10.4; p = 0.72) and was similar in a per-protocol analysis. There were no significant differences between arms in proportions of participants with grade 3/4 adverse events (18 SCT vs 16 CT participants; p = 0.71) or ART-related adverse events (10 vs 12; p = 0.82). 20 versus 8 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 16 SCT versus 4 CT participants, respectively (p = 0.005 comparing proportions between groups; incidence rate ratio 2.49, 95%CI 0.71‚Äì8.66, p = 0.15). 75% of SAEs (15 SCT, 6 CT) were hospitalisations for a wide range of conditions. 3 SCT and 6 CT participants switched to second-line ART following viral failure (p = 0.50).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sustainable non-inferiority of virological suppression in young people was shown for SCT versus CT over median 3.6 years.

During hemolysis, hemoglobin and heme released from red blood cells promote oxidative stress, inflammation and thrombosis. Plasma haptoglobin and hemopexin scavenge free hemoglobin and heme, respectively, but can be depleted in hemolytic states. Haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation protect tissues, including the vasculature, liver and kidneys. It is widely assumed that these protective effects are due primarily to hemoglobin and heme clearance from the vasculature. However, this simple assumption does not account for the consequent cytoprotective adaptation seen in cells and organs. To further address the mechanism, we used a hyperhemolytic murine model (Townes-SS) of sickle cell disease to examine cellular responses to haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation. A single infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin (¬± equimolar hemoglobin) in SS-mice increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the liver, kidney and skin several fold within 1 hour and decreased nuclear NF-ƒ∏B phospho-p65, and vaso-occlusion for 48 hours after infusion. Plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were not significantly changed 1 hour after infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin. Haptoglobin and hemopexin also inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation and lipopolysaccharide-induced vaso-occlusion in SS-mice. Inhibition of HO-1 activity with tin protoporphyrin blocked the protections afforded by haptoglobin and hemopexin in SS-mice. The HO-1 reaction product carbon monoxide, fully restored the protection, in part by inhibiting Weibel-Palade body mobilization of P-selectin and von Willebrand factor to endothelial cell surfaces. Thus, the mechanism by which haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation in hyperhemolytic SS-mice induces cytoprotective cellular responses is linked to increased HO-1 activity.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67c4:91749e5b</id><title>Haptoglobin and hemopexin inhibit vaso-occlusion and inflammation in murine sickle cell disease: Role of heme oxygenase-1 induction</title><fingerprint>f971aa14</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by John D.

In keeping with China‚Äôs President Xi Jinping‚Äôs ‚ÄúChinese Dream,‚Äù China has set a goal of becoming a world-class innovator by 2050. China‚Äôs higher education Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) research environment will play a pivotal role in influencing whether China is successful in transitioning from a manufacturing-based economy to an innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy. Past studies on China‚Äôs research environment have been primarily qualitative in nature or based on anecdotal evidence. In this study, we surveyed STEM faculty from China‚Äôs top 25 universities to get a clearer understanding of how faculty members view China‚Äôs overall research environment. We received 731 completed survey responses, 17% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from abroad and 83% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from domestic institutions of higher education. We present results on why returnees decided to study abroad, returnees‚Äô decisions to return to China, and differences in perceptions between returnees and domestic degree holders on the advantages of having a foreign degree. The top five challenges to China‚Äôs research environment identified by survey respondents were: a promotion of short-term thinking and instant success (37% of all respondents); research funding (33%); too much bureaucratic or governmental intervention (31%); the evaluation system (27%); and a reliance on human relations (26%). Results indicated that while China has clearly made strides in its higher education system, there are numerous challenges that must be overcome before China can hope to effectively produce the kinds of innovative thinkers that are required if it is to achieve its ambitious goals. We also raise questions about the current direction of education and inquiry in China, particularly indications that government policy is turning inward, away from openness that is central to innovative thinking.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6a:34f43e70</id><title>China‚Äôs science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research environment: A snapshot</title><fingerprint>1423b345</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xueying Han, Richard P.

The top five challenges to China‚Äôs research environment identified by survey respondents were: a promotion of short-term thinking and instant success (37% of all respondents); research funding (33%); too much bureaucratic or governmental intervention (31%); the evaluation system (27%); and a reliance on human relations (26%). Results indicated that while China has clearly made strides in its higher education system, there are numerous challenges that must be overcome before China can hope to effectively produce the kinds of innovative thinkers that are required if it is to achieve its ambitious goals. We also raise questions about the current direction of education and inquiry in China, particularly indications that government policy is turning inward, away from openness that is central to innovative thinking.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195008</link><updated>1522184400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195008</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Yutaro Kobayashi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195008</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195008</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1522184400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt;) is a Gram-negative bacterium that grows symbiotically with various edible plants, and the oral or sublingual administration of lipopolysaccharide derived from &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (LPSp) have been suggested to contribute to prevention of immune-related diseases. Our previous study indicated that orally administered LPSp was shown to exhibit an LDL-lowering effect in hyperlipidemic volunteers; however, a preventive effect of LPSp on atherosclerosis is unclear. The present study attempted to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic effect by LPSp in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. For 16 weeks, apoE-deficient mice were fed an HFD and received drinking water containing LPSp (0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight/day). The results showed that the orally administered LPSp decreased body weight. A significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque deposition was observed even with the lower dose of LPSp. The biochemical analyses showed that LPSp markedly improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma LDL and oxidized LDL levels. In addition, LPSp significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators including MCP-1 (in the plasma), TNF-Œ± and IL-6 (in the colon), and decreased the oxidative burst activities in the peripheral blood sample. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that oral administration of LPSp can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative responses to prevent atherosclerosis and related metabolic disorders.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1f:9f3b30f2</id><title>Oral administration of &amp;lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&amp;lt;/i&gt;-derived lipopolysaccharide prevents development of atherosclerosis in high-fat diet-fed apoE-deficient mice via ameliorating hyperlipidemia, pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative responses</title><fingerprint>9848fbe4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;

Anemia commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The management of patients with anemia in CKD is challenging, due to its severity, frequent hypo-responsiveness to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) and common hemoglobin cycling. Nonlinear dose-response curves and long delays in the effect of treatment on red blood cell population size complicate predictions of hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in individual patients. A comprehensive physiology based mathematical model for erythropoiesis was adapted individually to 60 hemodialysis patients treated with ESAs by identifying physiologically meaningful key model parameters from temporal Hgb data. Crit-Line&lt;sup&gt;¬Æ&lt;/sup&gt; III monitors provided non-invasive Hgb measurements for every hemodialysis treatment. We used Hgb data during a 150-day baseline period together to estimate a patient‚Äôs individual red blood cell lifespan, effects of the ESA on proliferation of red cell progenitor cells, endogenous erythropoietin production and ESA half-life. Estimated patient specific parameters showed excellent alignment with previously conducted clinical studies in hemodialysis patients. Further, the model qualitatively and quantitatively reflected empirical hemoglobin dynamics in demographically, anthropometrically and clinically diverse patients and accurately predicted the Hgb response to ESA therapy in individual patients for up to 21 weeks. The findings suggest that estimated model parameters can be used as a proxy for parameters that are clinically very difficult to quantify. The presented method has the potential to provide new insights into the individual pathophysiology of renal anemia and its association with clinical outcomes and can potentially be used to guide personalized anemia treatment.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccba:34f43e70</id><title>Prediction of hemoglobin levels in individual hemodialysis patients by means of a mathematical model of erythropoiesis</title><fingerprint>43effe27</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Doris H.

Background &lt;p&gt;Decreased but measurable serum IgA levels (‚â§70 mg/dL) have been associated with risk for infections in some populations, but are unstudied in COPD. This study tested the hypothesis that subnormal serum IgA levels would be associated with exacerbation risk in COPD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from 1,049 COPD participants from the observational cohort study SPIROMICS (535 (51%) women; mean age 66.1 (SD 7.8), 338 (32%) current smokers) who had baseline serum IgA measured using the Myriad RBM biomarker discovery platform. Exacerbation data was collected prospectively (mean 944.3 (SD 281.3) days), and adjusted linear, logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean IgA was 269.1 mg/dL (SD 150.9). One individual had deficient levels of serum IgA (&amp;lt;7 mg/dL) and 25 (2.4%) had IgA level ‚â§70 mg/dL. Participants with IgA ‚â§70 mg/dL were younger (62 vs. 66 years, p = 0.01) but otherwise similar to those with higher IgA. In adjusted models, IgA ‚â§70 mg/dL was associated with higher exacerbation incidence rates (IRR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01‚Äì2.87, p = 0.044) and greater risk for any severe exacerbation (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.30‚Äì6.94, p = 0.010). In adjusted models among those in the lowest decile (&amp;lt;120 mg/dL), each 10 mg/dL decrement in IgA (analyzed continuously) was associated with more exacerbations during follow-up (Œ≤ 0.24, 95% CI 0.017‚Äì0.46, p = 0.035).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Subnormal serum IgA levels were associated with increased risk for acute exacerbations, supporting mildly impaired IgA levels as a contributing factor in COPD morbidity. Additionally, a dose-response relationship between lower serum IgA and number of exacerbations was found among individuals with serum IgA in the lowest decile, further supporting the link between serum IgA and exacerbation risk. Future COPD studies should more comprehensively characterize immune status to define the clinical relevance of these findings and their potential for therapeutic correction.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc712f:34f43e70</id><title>Lower serum IgA is associated with COPD exacerbation risk in SPIROMICS</title><fingerprint>6d80d12d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nirupama Putcha, Gabriel G.

Recent studies have suggested reduced independent and sensitive parameter sets for stabilometry measurements based on correlation and variance analyses. However, the reliability of these recommended parameter sets has not been studied in the literature or not in every stance type used in stabilometry assessments, for example, single leg stances. The goal of this study is to evaluate the test-retest reliability of different time-based and frequency-based parameters that are calculated from the center of pressure (CoP) during bipedal and single leg stance for 30- and 60-second measurement intervals. Thirty healthy subjects performed repeated standing trials in a bipedal stance with eyes open and eyes closed conditions and in a single leg stance with eyes open for 60 seconds. A force distribution measuring plate was used to record the CoP. The reliability of the CoP parameters was characterized by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), coefficient of variation (CV) and CV compliance rate (CVCR). Based on the ICC, SEM and MDC results, many parameters yielded fair to good reliability values, while the CoP path length yielded the highest reliability (smallest ICC &gt; 0.67 (0.54‚Äì0.79), largest SEM% = 19.2%). Usually, frequency type parameters and extreme value parameters yielded poor reliability values. There were differences in the reliability of the maximum CoP velocity (better with 30 seconds) and mean power frequency (better with 60 seconds) parameters between the different sampling intervals.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344160:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Reliability analysis of a sensitive and independent stabilometry parameter set</title><fingerprint>9fea8b84</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gergely Nagym√°t√©, Zsanett Orlovits, Rita M.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has short- and long- term influence on pregnant women and fetus. Swimming, as an aerobic exercise, can effectively improve the blood glucose level in GDM, but the effect of mild swimming alone was not very substantial. Metformin, as an oral antidiabetic drug, has obvious hypoglycemic effect, and is economic also, but the long-term effect on pregnant women and fetus has not been completely clear. We hypothesize that combined intervention of mild swimming and low dose of metformin, may effectively reduce blood glucose, improve the pregnancy outcomes in GDM dams, but simultaneously avoiding the adverse effects caused by overdose of drug and impotence of mild swimming. The streptozotocin was used to stimulate C57BL/6J mice to develop GDM, by which serum glucose, TC, TG, LDL-C were increased significantly, meanwhile HDL-C was decreased significantly in the GDM control (DC) group compared with the normal control group. Swimming or metformin intervention slightly or moderately improves hyperglycemia, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice, while combined therapy of swimming plus metformin markedly ameliorated hyperglycemia (FPG, decreased by 22.2‚Äì59.5% from G10 to G18 versus DC group), insulin sensitivity (2.1 and 2.8 fold increase, respectively, in AKT activity versus DC group) and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; lipogenesis (3.2 and 7.0 fold decrease, respectively, in ACC activity, and 1.94 and 5.1 fold decrease, respectively, in SREBP2 level, versus DC group) both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice. We conclude that the combined intervention by metformin plus swimming may be more effective than single action to ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; improving insulin sensitivity in GDM mice.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f7:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Combined intervention of swimming plus metformin ameliorates the insulin resistance and impaired lipid metabolism in murine gestational diabetes mellitus</title><fingerprint>bcdbc13d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liping Huang, Pingping Yue, Xuefei Wu, Ting Yu, Yang Wang, Ji Zhou, Derun Kong, Keyang Chen&lt;/p&gt;

This study examined how people evaluate ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors, especially their predictions of the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors (Study 1). Further, it examined the individual effects of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors of an actor on the evaluation of his/her trait by considering the cases where the actor engages in and does not engage in the other behavior (Study 2). Study 1 revealed that the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors was perceived asymmetrically. Specifically, while the likelihood of ordinary prosocial actors to engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors was perceived as high, the same perception was not observed for extraordinary prosocial behaviors. On the other hand, extraordinary prosocial actors were perceived as highly likely to engage in both ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Study 2 revealed that the evaluation of actors who engaged in extraordinary prosocial behaviors but not ordinary prosocial behaviors did not exceed the evaluation of actors who engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors but not extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Additionally, the effect of extraordinary prosocial behaviors was more when the actor also engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors. These results suggest that extraordinary prosocial actors are evaluated highly when they also engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba5:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Is extraordinary prosocial behavior more valuable than ordinary prosocial behavior?</title><fingerprint>40977dd5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ikumi Futamura&lt;/p&gt;

We applied this method to the 6,4FeO+‚Äâ+‚ÄâH2 ‚Üí 6,4Fe+‚Äâ+‚ÄâH2O, 6,4FeO+‚Äâ+ CH4 ‚Üí 6,4Fe+‚Äâ+‚ÄâCH3OH, and 7Mn+‚Äâ+‚ÄâOCS ‚Üí 5MnS+‚Äâ+‚ÄâCO reactions, for which crossings between the different spin states are known to play essential roles in the overall reaction kinetics. ¬© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23579-w</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/156oJ0YjJXU/s41598-018-23579-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23579-w</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Pengfei Wu</name></author><published>1522911600000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23579-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522912924412</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Impacts of alpine wetland degradation on the composition, diversity and trophic structure of soil nematodes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Impacts of alpine wetland degradation on the composition, diversity and trophic structure of soil nematodes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23579-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23579-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Impacts of alpine wetland degradation on the composition, diversity and trophic structure of soil nematodes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/156oJ0YjJXU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16294af12fc:a2b62af:9f3b30f2</id><title>Author Correction: Impacts of alpine wetland degradation on the composition, diversity and trophic structure of soil nematodes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau</title><fingerprint>65a44f3d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Impacts of alpine wetland degradation on the composition, diversity and trophic structure of soil nematodes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Impacts of alpine wetland degradation on the composition, diversity and trophic structure of soil nematodes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23579-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23579-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Impacts of alpine wetland degradation on the composition, diversity and trophic structure of soil nematodes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/156oJ0YjJXU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03888-4</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/CinE4GfrB-o/s41467-018-03888-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03888-4</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Sergio C. de la Barrera</name></author><published>1523516400000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03888-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523525316949</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuning Ising superconductivity with layer and spin‚Äìorbit coupling in two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuning Ising superconductivity with layer and spin‚Äìorbit coupling in two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03888-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03888-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is promising to host features of topological superconductivity.

Osteoblast differentiation is a highly regulated process that requires coordinated information from both soluble factors and the extracellular matrix. Among these extracellular stimuli, chemical and physical properties of the matrix are sensed through cell surface receptors such as integrins and transmitted into the nucleus to drive specific gene expression. Here, we showed that the conditional deletion of Œ≤1 integrins in the osteo-precursor population severely impacts bone formation and homeostasis both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Mutant mice displayed a severe bone deficit characterized by bone fragility and reduced bone mass. We showed that Œ≤1 integrins are required for proper BMP2 dependent signaling at the pre-osteoblastic stage, by positively modulating Smad1/5-dependent transcriptional activity at the nuclear level. The lack of Œ≤1 integrins results in a transcription modulation that relies on a cooperative defect with other transcription factors rather than a plain blunted BMP2 response. Our results point to a nuclear modulation of Smad1/5 transcriptional activity by Œ≤1 integrins, allowing a tight control of osteoblast differentiation.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fe:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Œ≤1 integrins mediate the BMP2 dependent transcriptional control of osteoblast differentiation and osteogenesis</title><fingerprint>f42ce162</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Molly Brunner, No√©mie Mandier, Thierry Gautier, Genevieve Chevalier, Anne-Sophie Ribba, Philippe Guardiola, Marc R.

The neurons that form the mammalian neocortex originate from progenitor cells in the ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ). Newborn neurons are multipolar but become bipolar during their migration from the germinal layers to the cortical plate (CP) by forming a leading process and an axon that extends in the intermediate zone (IZ). Once they settle in the CP, neurons assume a highly polarized morphology with a single axon and multiple dendrites. The AMPK-related kinases SadA and SadB are intrinsic factors that are essential for axon formation during neuronal development downstream of Lkb1. The knockout of both genes encoding Sad kinases (&lt;i&gt;Sada&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sadb&lt;/i&gt;) results not only in a loss of axons but also a decrease in the size of the cortical plate. The defect in axon formation has been linked to a function of Sad kinases in the regulation of microtubule binding proteins. However, the causes for the reduced size of the cortical plate in the &lt;i&gt;Sada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;Sadb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; knockout remain to be analyzed in detail.

The reduced number of progenitors is a non-cell autonomous defect since they do not express Sad kinases. These defects are restricted to the neocortex while the hippocampus remains unaffected.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae82:fc1f8953</id><title>The loss of the kinases SadA and SadB results in early neuronal apoptosis and a reduced number of progenitors</title><fingerprint>e66fa717</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pratibha Dhumale, Sindhu Menon, Joanna Chiang, Andreas W.

These defects are restricted to the neocortex while the hippocampus remains unaffected.</description></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00110</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00110/20180327/images/medium/jp-2018-001107_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00110&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

But change in this area is a hard thing to bring about.¬†&lt;em&gt;Biocentury&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/biocentury/regulation/2018-04-12/why-john-ioannidis-says-norm-p-values-should-shift-0005&quot;&gt;a good interview&lt;/a&gt; with someone who can tell you about that, John Ioannidis, of scientific reproducibility fame. He‚Äôs recently set off a lot of comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2676503?redirect=true&quot;&gt;with a proposal&lt;/a&gt; to lower the threshold for ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù to p &amp;lt; 0.005, and as you‚Äôd imagine, there are some strong opinions on that. His estimate is that this would shift about a third of the published biomedical results to ‚Äúsuggestive‚Äù rather than significant, and his take on this is, basically ‚Äúgood riddance‚Äù. According to Ioannidis, a lot of those are false positives anyway, and a lot of the ones that are real are not really useful. Here‚Äôs the root of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: What is the correct way to think about a p-value?&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: A p-value is the probability or the chance that you‚Äôll see a result that is so extreme as the one that you see if the null hypothesis is true and if there is no bias. Many people say a p-value is the chance of the null hypothesis being wrong, of some effect being there. This completely ignores the fact that you have these two ‚Äòifs‚Äô that are required to interpret the p-value. So it is the chance of seeing such an extreme result, or something even more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true and if we have no bias.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he‚Äôs upfront about the fact that his suggested new threshold is not the final answer, but just an interim step towards larger reforms. He wants to see better experimental and trial designs (Bayesian and traditional), larger sample sizes, and more attention paid to potential sources of bias and to effect size. In fact, if people just go wild for the new, stricter p-values, it‚Äôll be a loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: Don‚Äôt you have a concern that by moving to a smaller p-value you are reinforcing the fetish about p-values and driving people to create enormous data sets? With data sets that are big enough, you can get very small p-values, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the results mean anything.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: Absolutely. And this is why 80% of the literature should not be using p-values, maybe 90% of the literature. With huge amounts of data, with big data, using a p-value means nothing, because everything can be statistically significant at 0.05 or even at 0.005. &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the question is, how do you change the mentality of people who are kind of automatically hooked to using a single magic number? It‚Äôs not that the alternative approaches that are better, like using effect size and confidence intervals or using Bayesian statistics, are recent. They have been out there for a long time, but their adoption, even though it is accelerating, has not been what we want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, he thinks that p-value is the right tool for the job about 20% of the time, whereas Bayesian measures could be useful half the time, maybe even more. One instant objection to the idea of lowering p-value cutoffs is that it will make everything much more expensive and time-consuming (clinical trials, first and foremost), but his contention is that it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Better designs and more appropriate measures could cancel a lot of the brute-force bigger-sample stuff ‚Äì and you get the impression that he‚Äôs deliberately pushing people towards those by making it too expensive to do it the old way. ‚ÄúWe have some very strong tools that we don‚Äôt apply‚Äù, says Ioannidis, and he‚Äôs going to try to make people apply them, one way or another. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162ce5485f1:29ae598:9f3b30f2</id><title>Tighten Up Your Numbers!</title><fingerprint>cdaa5190</fingerprint><description>There‚Äôs clearly something wrong with the way that statistics get handled and interpreted in scientific studies, and there have been many warnings.

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children &amp;lt;5years and adults &gt;65 years (2004‚Äì2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c4a:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Increased carriage of non-vaccine serotypes with low invasive disease potential four years after switching to the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in The Netherlands</title><fingerprint>590fb747</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marloes Vissers, Alienke J.

Some final considerations and suggestions for further improvement of the predictors are discussed.</description></item><item><link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0092867418302381%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De78e47ae8362faa310ee5310a82873c1</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Yanmei Han, Qiuyan Liu, Jin Hou, Yan Gu, Yi Zhang, Zhubo Chen, Jia Fan, Weiping Zhou, Shuangjian Qiu, Yonghong Zhang, Tao Dong, Ning Li, Zhengping Jiang, Ha Zhu, Qian Zhang, Yuanwu Ma, Lianfeng Zhang, Qingqing Wang, Yizhi Yu, Nan Li, Xuetao Cao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img width=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0092867418302381-fx1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Teaser&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0092867418302381%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De78e47ae8362faa310ee5310a82873c1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell</title><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/7051</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0092867418302381-fx1.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>375</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>375</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418302381</canonicalUrl><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0092867418302381%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De78e47ae8362faa310ee5310a82873c1</originId><published>1523662234000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523662580928</crawled><unread>True</unread><id>ddrqBKs4zv6P2LJ/Yet5DnTeHcVpDjrLAtovki3VQZ8=_162c15decc0:199584f:34f43e70</id><title>Tumor-Induced Generation of Splenic Erythroblast-like Ter-Cells Promotes Tumor Progression</title><fingerprint>c28920e0</fingerprint><description>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Yanmei Han, Qiuyan Liu, Jin Hou, Yan Gu, Yi Zhang, Zhubo Chen, Jia Fan, Weiping Zhou, Shuangjian Qiu, Yonghong Zhang, Tao Dong, Ning Li, Zhengping Jiang, Ha Zhu, Qian Zhang, Yuanwu Ma, Lianfeng Zhang, Qingqing Wang, Yizhi Yu, Nan Li, Xuetao Cao&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img width=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0092867418302381-fx1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Teaser&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1472?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1472?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1472?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1472.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Goldsmith, G.

Thus, our data suggest a &amp;quot;switch-inhibition&amp;quot; mechanism in which force imbalance is generated by inhibiting, rather than activating, dyneins on alternating sides of the flagellum.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9</link><engagementRate>0.47</engagementRate><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Holly Else</name></author><published>1524466800000</published><recrawled>1524513320971</recrawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>60</engagement><crawled>1524507756636</crawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04958-9/d41586-018-04958-9_15713116.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists‚Äô early grant success fuels further funding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists‚Äô early grant success fuels further funding, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04958-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Young researchers who narrowly miss out on postdoctoral grant struggle to compete with those who just qualify.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162f3be485c:62505c7:9f3b30f2</id><title>Scientists‚Äô early grant success fuels further funding</title><fingerprint>72e720de</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists‚Äô early grant success fuels further funding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists‚Äô early grant success fuels further funding, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04958-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Young researchers who narrowly miss out on postdoctoral grant struggle to compete with those who just qualify.</description></item><item><link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0092867418302861%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D29229080a53c260109bd262707f4a873</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell, Volume 173, Issue 1&lt;br&gt; Author(s): David P.

Objective: This study aims at providing an integrated resource of mRNA, protein and metabolite changes in the neonatal heart to identify metabolism-related mechanisms associated with the postnatal loss of regenerative capacity. Methods and Results: Mouse ventricular tissue samples taken on postnatal days 1, 4, 9 and 23 (P01, P04, P09 and P23, respectively) were analyzed with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and global proteomics and metabolomics. Differential expression was observed for 8547 mRNAs and for 1199 of the 2285 quantified proteins. Furthermore, 151 metabolites with significant changes were identified. Gene ontology analysis, KEGG pathway analysis and fuzzy c-means clustering were used to identify biological processes and metabolic pathways either up- or downregulated on all three levels. Among these were branched chain amino acid degradation (upregulated at P23) and production of free saturated and monounsaturated medium- to long-chain fatty acids (upregulated at P04 and P09; downregulated at P23). Moreover, the HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS)-mediated mevalonate pathway and ketogenesis were transiently activated.

Auxin response proteins are represented by large families of diverse functions, but neither their origin nor their evolution is understood. Here, we use a deep phylogenomics approach to reconstruct both the origin and the evolutionary trajectory of all nuclear auxin response protein families. We found that, while all subdomains are ancient, a complete auxin response mechanism is limited to land plants.

Auxin response proteins are represented by large families of diverse functions, but neither their origin nor their evolution is understood. Here, we use a deep phylogenomics approach to reconstruct both the origin and the evolutionary trajectory of all nuclear auxin response protein families. We found that, while all subdomains are ancient, a complete auxin response mechanism is limited to land plants. Functional phylogenomics predicts defined steps in the evolution of response system properties, and comparative transcriptomics across six ancient lineages revealed how these innovations shaped a sophisticated response mechanism. Genetic analysis in a basal land plant revealed unexpected contributions of ancient non-canonical proteins in auxin response as well as auxin-unrelated function of core transcription factors.

The present study aimed to identify novel microbial producers of bioemulsificant compounds from Antarctic soils. Fifty-nine microbial strains were isolated from five different locations at South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, and screened for biosurfactant production by Œ≤-hemolytic activity. Strain So 3.2 was determined as bioemulsifier-producer and identified by phenotypic and molecular characterization as &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt;. Emulsification activity, oil displacement method and drop-collapsing test were performed to evaluate the biosurfactant activity with different oils and hydrocarbons using two different culture media (Luria Bertani and Bushnell Haas in the presence of different carbon sources: glucose, glycerol, olive oil and n-Hexadecane). Cell free supernatant of Bushnell Haas culture supplemented with n-Hexadecane showed the best results for all tests. Emulsification of hydrocarbons exceeded 60%, reaching up to 90% on oil with high API grade, while displacement tests ranged from 8 cm to 4 cm in diameter according the culture media and tested oils. Our results revealed that &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt; So3.2 is able to produce bioemulsifiers capable of emulsifying hydrocarbons and oils, which could be used in different biotechnological applications, particularly for bioremediation of environments contaminated by oil leaks.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb93:7d6c1c1c</id><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&amp;lt;/i&gt; So3.2 from Antarctic soil as a novel producer of compounds with bioemulsification potential</title><fingerprint>fea54681</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudio Lamilla, Douglas Braga, Rui Castro, Carolina Guimar√£es, Livia V.

The reliable assessment and management of avian pain is important in the context of animal welfare. Overtly expressed signs of pain vary substantially between and within species, strains and individuals, limiting the use of behaviour in pain studies. Similarly, physiological indices of pain can also vary and may be confounded by influence from non-painful stimuli. In mammals, changes in the frequency spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded under light anaesthesia (the minimal anaesthesia model; MAM) have been shown to reliably indicate cerebral responses to noxious stimuli in a range of species. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the MAM can be applied to the study of nociception in birds. Ten chickens were lightly anaesthetised with halothane and their EEG recorded using surface electrodes during the application of supramaximal mechanical, thermal and electrical noxious stimuli. Spectral analysis revealed no EEG responses to any of these stimuli. Given that birds possess the neural apparatus to detect and process pain, and that the applied noxious stimuli elicit behavioural signs of pain in conscious chickens, this lack of response probably relates to methodological limitations. Anatomical differences between the avian and mammalian brains, along with a paucity of knowledge regarding specific sites of pain processing in the avian brain, could mean that EEG recorded from the head surface is insensitive to changes in neural activity in the pain processing regions of the avian brain. Future investigations should examine alternative electrode placement sites, based on avian homologues of the mammalian brain regions involved in pain processing.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae72:fc1f8953</id><title>Effects of noxious stimuli on the electroencephalogram of anaesthetised chickens (&amp;lt;i&gt;Gallus gallus domesticus&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><fingerprint>3eaa673c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amanda E.

The molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility to severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection remain poorly understood. Herein, we report on the role of osteopontin (OPN) in regulation of RSV infection in human epithelial cells and how interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Œ≤), a cytokine secreted soon after RSV infection, when persistently expressed can induce OPN expression leading to increased viral infection. We first compared OPN expression in two human epithelial cell lines: HEK-293 and HEp-2. In contrast to HEp-2, HEK-293 expresses low levels of pro-caspase-1 resulting in decreased IL-1Œ≤ expression in response to RSV infection. We found a correlation between low IL-1Œ≤ levels and a delay in induction of OPN expression in RSV-infected HEK-293 cells compared to HEp-2. This phenomenon could partially explain the high susceptibility of HEp-2 cells to RSV infection versus the moderate susceptibility of HEK-293 cells. Also, HEK-293 cells expressing low levels of pro-caspase-1 exhibit decreased IL-1Œ≤ expression and delayed OPN expression in response to RSV infection. HEK-293 cells incubated with human rIL-1Œ≤ showed a dose-dependent increase in OPN expression upon RSV infection. Also, incubation with rOPN increased RSV viral load. Moreover, HEp-2 cells or mice infected with a mucogenic RSV strain RSV-L19F showed elevated levels of OPN in contrast to mice infected with the laboratory RSV strain rA2. This correlated with elevated levels of OPN following infection with RSV-L19F compared to rA2. Together, these results demonstrate that increased OPN expression is regulated in part by IL-1Œ≤, and the interplay between IL-1Œ≤ and OPN signaling may play a pivotal role in the spread of RSV infection.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7ec:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Osteopontin plays a pivotal role in increasing severity of respiratory syncytial virus infection</title><fingerprint>e2bfe0a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viviana Sampayo-Escobar, Ryan Green, Michael B.

Sweat includes active components and metabolites, which are needed to maintain skin homeostasis. Component changes in sweat derived from atopic dermatitis (AD) have been reported. To investigate the influence of sweat components on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed a multifaceted assessment, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomic analysis, and linked these features to clinical features of AD. Distinctive properties of AD sweat are the quite-variation in protein, anti-microbial peptides and glucose concentrations. pH, sodium, and other salt levels in sweat of AD were comparable to that of healthy subjects. Sweat from AD patients with acute inflammation had a more prominent increase in glucose concentration than sweat from healthy individuals or those with AD with chronic inflammation. Topical glucose application delayed recovery of transepidermal water loss in barrier-disrupted mice. Furthermore, the glucose transporter GLUT2 was highly expressed in the lumen of sweat glands from AD patients. AD patients with chronic inflammation had significantly increased &lt;i&gt;GLUT2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression and near normal sweat glucose levels. Despite the small sample size in our study, we speculate that the increased glucose levels might be affected by AD severity and phenotype. We hope that this report will bring novel insight into the impact of sweat components on the clinical manifestation of AD.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fb:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Sweat glucose and GLUT2 expression in atopic dermatitis: Implication for clinical manifestation and treatment</title><fingerprint>85cdc031</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emi Ono, Hiroyuki Murota, Yuki Mori, Yoshichika Yoshioka, Yuko Nomura, Takichi Munetsugu, Hiroo Yokozeki, Ichiro Katayama&lt;/p&gt;

We hope that this report will bring novel insight into the impact of sweat components on the clinical manifestation of AD.</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292078v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292078v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292078v1?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/292078</canonicalUrl><author><name>Wang, W.</name></author><published>1522393200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522425207168</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Non-parametric and semi-parametric resampling procedures are widely used to perform support estimation in computational biology and bioinformatics.

Alveolar epithelial cells are critical to the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are associated with overexpression of type 2 cytokine IL-13. IL-13 is known to induce the production of profibrotic (e.g., periostin) and pro-inflammatory (e.g., eotaxin-3) mediators in human airway epithelial cells, but it remains unclear if human primary alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression following IL-13 stimulation. The goals of this study are to determine if alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression upon IL-13 stimulation, and if alveolar and airway epithelial cells from the same subjects have similar responses to IL-13. Paired alveolar and airway epithelial cells were isolated from donors without any lung disease, and cultured under submerged or air-liquid interface conditions with or without IL-13. Up-regulation of periostin protein and mRNA was observed in IL-13-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells, which was comparable to that in IL-13-stimulated paired airway epithelial cells. IL-13 also increased eotaxin-3 expression in alveolar epithelial cells, but the level of eotaxin mRNA was lower in alveolar epithelial cells than in airway epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that human alveolar epithelial cells are able to produce periostin and eotaxin in responses to IL-13 stimulation. This study suggests the need to further determine the contribution of alveolar epithelial cell-derived mediators to pulmonary fibrosis.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935cf:9f3b30f2</id><title>IL-13 induces periostin and eotaxin expression in human primary alveolar epithelial cells: Comparison with paired airway epithelial cells</title><fingerprint>3c6ce039</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoko Ito, Reem Al Mubarak, Nicole Roberts, Kelly Correll, William Janssen, James Finigan, Rangnath Mishra, Hong Wei Chu&lt;/p&gt;

When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162688e2a3c:4d824:a077e55f</id><title>Dynamic combination of sensory and reward information under time pressure</title><fingerprint>840f90f3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiva Farashahi, Chih-Chung Ting, Chang-Hao Kao, Shih-Wei Wu, Alireza Soltani&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ‚â•15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson‚Äôs Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ‚â•50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults.

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ‚â•15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson‚Äôs Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ‚â•50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults. However, older adults have a higher all-cause mortality rate, perhaps partially driven by late presentation to care.

The hemodynamic effects of intravenous (IV) paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are unknown. We performed a prospective single center placebo controlled randomized study with parallel group design in adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Participants received paracetamol (1 gram) IV or placebo (an equal volume of 0.9% saline) preoperatively followed by two postoperative doses 6 hours apart. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in systolic (SBP) 30 minutes after the preoperative infusion, analysed using an ANCOVA model. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB), and other key hemodynamic variables after each infusion. All other endpoints were analysed using random-effect generalized least squares regression modelling with individual patients treated as random effects. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to receive paracetamol (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). Post preoperative infusion, paracetamol decreased SBP by a mean (SD) of 13 (18) mmHg, p = 0.02, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (11) mmHg with saline. Paracetamol decreased MAP and DBP by a mean (SD) of 9 (12) mmHg and 8 (9) mmHg (p = 0.01 and 0.02), respectively, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (8) mmHg and 0 (6) mmHg with placebo. Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in pressure or flow based hemodynamic parameters in both groups. This study provides high quality evidence that the administration of IV paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery causes a transient decrease in preoperative blood pressure when administered before surgery but no adverse hemodynamic effects when administered in the postoperative setting.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aec:9f3b30f2</id><title>The hemodynamic effects of intravenous paracetamol (acetaminophen) vs normal saline in cardiac surgery patients: A single center placebo controlled randomized study</title><fingerprint>ac938260</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Chiam, Rinaldo Bellomo, Leonid Churilov, Laurence Weinberg&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Although not currently recommended, spirometry during hospitalization due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an opportunity to enhance the diagnosis of this disease.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Although not currently recommended, spirometry during hospitalization due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an opportunity to enhance the diagnosis of this disease. The aim of the present study was to assess the usefulness and reliability of spirometry before hospital discharge, comparing it to measurements obtained during clinical stability.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective longitudinal observational study compares spirometry results before and 8 weeks after discharge in consecutive patients admitted for COPD exacerbation.

We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of combined use of salivary gland ultrasonography (US) and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatic Disease (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for improving the diagnostic efficiency in patients with Sj√∂gren‚Äôs syndrome (SS). A US-based salivary gland disease grading system was developed using a cohort comprising 213 SS or non-SS patients who fulfilled the minimum requirements for classifying SS based on the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria. Using 62 SS or non-SS patients from the 213 patients and who had also undergone all the 5 examinations needed for the ACR/EULAR classification, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications for diagnosing SS, using the clinical diagnosis of SS by rheumatologists as the gold standard. The ACR/EULAR criteria discriminated clinical SS patients with 77% and 79% accuracy for those with primary or secondary SS and for those with primary SS, respectively. However, the integrated score system of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications yielded 92% and 93% accuracy for these 2 SS patient groups, respectively, provided that US score of 3 was assigned to patients with US grade ‚â•2, and then patients with integrated threshold score of ‚â•5 were diagnosed as SS. Cross-validation also indicated improved accuracy of the integrated ACR/EULAR and US score system (91.9 and 93.0% for primary/secondary and primary SS patients, respectively) over that by the ACR/EULAR criteria alone. (74.2 and 86.0%, respectively). The integrated ACR/EULAR and US scoring system can improve the diagnosis of patients with clinical SS.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f57:34f43e70</id><title>Combined classification system based on ACR/EULAR and ultrasonographic scores for improving the diagnosis of Sj√∂gren&apos;s syndrome</title><fingerprint>5914b6d6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yukinori Takagi, Hideki Nakamura, Misa Sumi, Toshimasa Shimizu, Yasuko Hirai, Yoshiro Horai, Ayuko Takatani, Atsushi Kawakami, Sato Eida, Miho Sasaki, Takashi Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

Managing landscape connectivity is a widely recognized overarching strategy for conserving biodiversity in human-impacted landscapes. However, planning the conservation and management of landscape connectivity of multiple and ecologically distinct species is still challenging. Here we provide a spatially-explicit framework which identifies and prioritizes connectivity conservation and restoration actions for species with distinct habitat affinities. Specifically, our study system comprised three groups of common bird species, forest-specialists, farmland-specialists, and generalists, populating a highly heterogeneous agricultural countryside in the southwestern Iberian Peninsula. We first performed a comprehensive analysis of the environmental variables underlying the distributional patterns of each bird species to reveal generalities in their guild-specific responses to landscape structure. Then, we identified sites which could be considered pivotal in maintaining current levels of landscape connectivity for the three bird guilds simultaneously, as well as the number and location of sites that need to be restored to maximize connectivity levels. Interestingly, we found that a small number of sites defined the shortest connectivity paths for the three bird guilds simultaneously, and were therefore considered key for conservation. Moreover, an even smaller number of sites were identified as critical to expand the landscape connectivity at maximum for the regional bird assemblage as a whole. Our spatially-explicit framework can provide valuable decision-making support to conservation practitioners aiming to identify key connectivity and restoration sites, a particularly urgent task in rapidly changing landscapes such as agroecosystems.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd7a:9f3b30f2</id><title>A distribution-oriented approach to support landscape connectivity for ecologically distinct bird species</title><fingerprint>6d4cd297</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jos√© M.

Our spatially-explicit framework can provide valuable decision-making support to conservation practitioners aiming to identify key connectivity and restoration sites, a particularly urgent task in rapidly changing landscapes such as agroecosystems.</description></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/281-b?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/281-b?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/281-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/281.2.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Zahn, L.

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world‚Äôs largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16272f1be07:b826c:a077e55f</id><title>Eleven quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows with cloud computing</title><fingerprint>1848664e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian S.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To study the performance of multifocal-visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) signals filtered using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in discriminating, based on amplitude, between control and multiple sclerosis (MS) patient groups, and to reduce variability in interocular latency in control subjects.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;MfVEP signals were obtained from controls, clinically definitive MS and MS-risk progression patients (radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)). The conventional method of processing mfVEPs consists of using a 1‚Äì35 Hz bandpass frequency filter (X&lt;sub&gt;DFT&lt;/sub&gt;).The EMD algorithm was used to decompose the X&lt;sub&gt;DFT&lt;/sub&gt; signals into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). This signal processing was assessed by computing the amplitudes and latencies of the X&lt;sub&gt;DFT&lt;/sub&gt; and IMF signals (X&lt;sub&gt;EMD&lt;/sub&gt;). The amplitudes from the full visual field and from ring 5 (9.8‚Äì15¬∞ eccentricity) were studied. The discrimination index was calculated between controls and patients. Interocular latency values were computed from the X&lt;sub&gt;DFT&lt;/sub&gt; and X&lt;sub&gt;EMD&lt;/sub&gt; signals in a control database to study variability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using the amplitude of the mfVEP signals filtered with EMD (X&lt;sub&gt;EMD&lt;/sub&gt;) obtains higher discrimination index values than the conventional method when control, MS-risk progression (RIS and CIS) and MS subjects are studied. The lowest variability in interocular latency computations from the control patient database was obtained by comparing the X&lt;sub&gt;EMD&lt;/sub&gt; signals with the X&lt;sub&gt;DFT&lt;/sub&gt; signals. Even better results (amplitude discrimination and latency variability) were obtained in ring 5 (9.8‚Äì15¬∞ eccentricity of the visual field).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Filtering mfVEP signals using the EMD algorithm will result in better identification of subjects at risk of developing MS and better accuracy in latency studies.

This obviously is most important (and can have the biggest effect) if your compound has a short half-life after dosing to begin with (and plenty of compounds do). As the paper notes, if you have constant clearance for the unbound fraction of your compound, then the relationship between dose and half-life is exponential, not linear (whereas most of the other combinations you can come up with are simply linear ones). That really gives you a handle to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, you don‚Äôt have to wait until human data to worry about such things. The allometric scaling factor between rats and humans is about 4.3, so if you‚Äôve done your homework about what the mechanisms of clearance are (which enzymes are responsible and how well they correlate to human ones, for example), you‚Äôre ready to work from there. The paper notes, though, that these sorts of correlations have a much higher chance of going haywire on you for very short half-life compounds (less than two hours, say), so if you want to have any confidence at all in your dose prediction models, you really should get rat half-life out longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group shows a plot of about 10,000 Merck compounds with rat measurements of unbound-clearance versus steady-state volume of distribution, and it‚Äôs (as you might figure) a pretty good correlation. The key, then, is to find changes in a molecule‚Äôs structure that will get it off that line, because otherwise you‚Äôll end up in a similar situation to where you started. That is, you can find yourself reducing the unbound clearance and ending up with an effective half life that‚Äôs not really improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what sorts of modifications actually improve the half-life? The paper shows the result of a large matched-molecular-pairs (MMP) analysis, where structures were varied at only one place. Increasing lipophilicity will do the trick, sometimes, if the partitioning of your compound into tissue increases more than just its binding to plasma proteins. The Merck data suggest that adding multiple fluorines to a compound‚Äôs structure tends to have this effect. The fluorinated compounds tend, apparently, to bind to tissue at an increased rate more than they bind to serum albumin. You may or may not be comfortable with this advice, since polyfluorinated compounds may also be harder to formulate, and some of that tissue binding may be to things that you‚Äôd rather not bind to. But it will increase your half-life, and it‚Äôs up to each med-chem team to see if they want to make that deal with this particular fluorocarbon-coated devil. The free lunch has (still) not yet arrived in the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, another classic way to increase half-life is to block sites of metabolism. The Merck group noted this in a general way with matched molecular pairs that changed hydrogens to chlorines, hydrogens to methyls, and methyls to chlorines. H to Cl increased half life, presumably for similar reasons to fluorination. H to methyl did not, though: that does increase lipophilicity, but at the expense of adding new groups for the liver enzymes to chew on. But methyl to chloro did improve half-lives, on average ‚Äì the lipophilicities are nearly the same, but you‚Äôve battened down the hatches for enzymatic degradation. (As you‚Äôd imagine, H to CF3 is the extreme example of this effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about replacing with more polar groups, rather than with nonstick coatings? On average, phenyl to pyridyl lowers half life, H to OH does too, and H to COOH &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lowers half-life. It‚Äôs worth noting that the carboxylic acids, overall, tend to have higher binding to plasma protein, so that tells you that the increased half-life of the halogenated compounds isn‚Äôt coming about by that mechanism, at least not exclusively. It‚Äôs worth noting, though, that just greasing up your compounds is not the answer. Fluorination and chlorination seem to work, but as a look at the broader MMP universe shows, increasing lipophilicity in general does not necessarily help your half-life. Decreasing lipophilicity, on the other hand, has a much better chance of hurting it.¬†It looks, overall, as if the steady-state volume of distribution is more sensitive to modifications in the structure than is clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper has a list of groups that seem to help with increasing half-life, more often than not, and ones that seem to hurt. In addition to general halogenation, others in the first beneficial category include primary amines, NH pyrrolidines, piperidines, piperazines, and morpholines, 3,4-dihaloaryls, and (interestingly) 2-methyl-4-pyrimidones. In the likely-to-lower category, on the other hand, are pyridines and pyrimidines attached at the 2 position, N-attached pyrazoles (and other related 5-membered heterocycles that have that core), unsubstituted phenyls (and 4-pyridyls), primary alcohols, and simple cyclopropyls. Read and heed!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162d9294c75:3a5eba4:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Pharmacokinetic Advice from Merck‚Äôs Collection</title><fingerprint>bf925e00</fingerprint><description>Here‚Äôs a solid med-chem paper from Merck on the topic of extending half-life for small-molecule drugs.

L-Proline is a multifunctional amino acid that plays an essential role in primary metabolism and physiological functions. Proline is oxidized to glutamate in the mitochondria and the FAD-containing enzyme proline oxidase (PO) catalyzes the first step in L-proline degradation pathway. Alterations in proline metabolism have been described in various human diseases, such as hyperprolinemia type I, velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Di George syndrome, schizophrenia and cancer. In particular, the mutation giving rise to the substitution &lt;i&gt;Leu441Pro&lt;/i&gt; was identified in patients suffering of schizophrenia and hyperprolinemia type I. Here, we report on the expression of wild-type and &lt;i&gt;L441P&lt;/i&gt; variants of human PO in a U87 glioblastoma human cell line in an attempt to assess their effect on glutamate metabolism. The subcellular localization of the flavoenzyme is not altered in the &lt;i&gt;L441P&lt;/i&gt; variant, for which specific activity is halved compared to the wild-type PO. While this decrease in activity is significantly less than that previously proposed, an effect of the substitution on the enzyme stability is also apparent in our studies. At 24 hours of growth from transient transfection, the intracellular level of proline, glutamate, and glutamine is decreased in cells expressing the PO variants as compared to control U87 cells, reaching a similar figure at 72 h. On the other hand, the extracellular levels of the three selected amino acids show a similar time course for all clones. Furthermore, PO overexpression does not modify to a significant extent the expression of GLAST and GLT-1 glutamate transporters. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the proline pathway links cellular proline levels with those of glutamate and glutamine. On this side, PO might play a regulatory role in glutamatergic neurotransmission by affecting the cellular concentration of glutamate.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67ba:91749e5b</id><title>Proline oxidase controls proline, glutamate, and glutamine cellular concentrations in a U87 glioblastoma cell line</title><fingerprint>113a5b2b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pamela Cappelletti, Elena Tallarita, Valentina Rabattoni, Paola Campomenosi, Silvia Sacchi, Loredano Pollegioni&lt;/p&gt;

Gene regulation at the transcriptional level is a central process in all organisms, and DNA-binding transcription factors, known as TFs, play a fundamental role. This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named ‚Äúcompanion domain‚Äù (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: i) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA. Based on a classification of the organisms according to the life-styles, a major abundance of regulatory families in free-living organisms, in contrast with pathogenic, extremophilic or intracellular organisms, was identified. Finally, the protein architecture diversity associated to the 19 families considering a weight score for domain promiscuity evidenced which regulatory families were characterized by either a large diversity of CDs, here named as ‚Äúpromiscuous‚Äù families given the elevated number of variable domains found in those TFs, or a low diversity of CDs. Altogether this information helped us to understand the diversity and distribution of the 19 Prokaryotes TF families. Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f68:34f43e70</id><title>Abundance, diversity and domain architecture variability in prokaryotic DNA-binding transcription factors</title><fingerprint>993d9672</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto Perez-Rueda, Rafael Hernandez-Guerrero, Mario Alberto Martinez-Nu√±ez, Dagoberto Armenta-Medina, Israel Sanchez, J.

Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies.</description></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023420?af=R</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023420?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023420?af=R</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Zeke A.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can promote evolutionary adaptation by transforming a species‚Äô relationship to the environment. In most well-understood cases of HGT, acquired and donor functions appear to remain closely related. Thus, the degree to which HGT can lead to evolutionary novelties remains unclear. Mucorales fungi sense gravity through the sedimentation of vacuolar protein crystals. Here, we identify the octahedral crystal matrix protein (OCTIN). Phylogenetic analysis strongly supports acquisition of &lt;i&gt;octin&lt;/i&gt; by HGT from bacteria. A bacterial OCTIN forms high-order periplasmic oligomers, and inter-molecular disulphide bonds are formed by both fungal and bacterial OCTINs, suggesting that they share elements of a conserved assembly mechanism. However, estimated sedimentation velocities preclude a gravity-sensing function for the bacterial structures. Together, our data suggest that HGT from bacteria into the Mucorales allowed a dramatic increase in assembly scale and emergence of the gravity-sensing function. We conclude that HGT can lead to evolutionary novelties that emerge depending on the physiological and cellular context of protein assembly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3S3tn6RO_8s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f8c0d479:29c06b:ae8b474d</id><title>Evolutionary novelty in gravity sensing through horizontal gene transfer and high-order protein assembly</title><fingerprint>305bb730</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tu Anh Nguyen, Jamie Greig, Asif Khan, Cara Goh, Gregory Jedd&lt;/p&gt;

Investigation of human diet during the Neolithic has often been limited to a few archaeological cultures or single sites. In order to provide insight into the development of human food consumption and husbandry strategies, our study explores bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 466 human and 105 faunal individuals from 26 sites in central Germany. It is the most extensive data set to date from an enclosed geographic microregion, covering 4,000 years of agricultural history from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The animal data show that a variety of pastures and dietary resources were explored, but that these changed remarkably little over time. In the human &lt;i&gt;Œ¥&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N however we found a significant increase with time across the different archaeological cultures. This trend could be observed in all time periods and archaeological cultures (Bell Beaker phenomenon excluded), even on continuously populated sites. Since there was no such trend in faunal isotope values, we were able largely to exclude manuring as the cause of this effect. Based on the rich interdisciplinary data from this region and archaeological period we can argue that meat consumption increased with the increasing duration of farming subsistence.

It seems that faba bean (FB) seeds could be a good protein-energy component in animal feed, but the presence of anti-nutritional substances limits their use as a substitute of soybean meal. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of different concentrations of raw, low-tannin, FB seeds on the gut-bone axis in Ross 308 broilers. One-day old chickens were randomly subjected to one of the 3 dietary treatments: the control group was fed standard diet based on soybean meal and without FB seeds, and two groups were fed 8%/15% and 16%/22% of raw low-tannin FB seeds in the starter and grower, respectively. On the 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, hematological and serum biochemical analyses as well histomorphometry of the small intestine and liver tissue and bone mechanical tests were performed. The diet type had no effect on the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. However, the basal intestinal structures were significantly reduced in birds fed the lower concentration of FB. The enlargement of nerve plexuses was dependent on the concentration used in the diet and, additionally, on the kind of plexus and location in the intestinal tract. The liver was characterized by an increase in non-hepatocytes. There was no influence of the low-tannin FB seeds on most of the analyzed serum parameters in the 35-day-old broiler chickens, except the decreased concentration of total cholesterol and Ca in both experimental groups, triglycerides in group I, and P and uric acid in group II. Furthermore, the increasing concentration of the dietary low-tannin FB did not influence the activities of AspAT (except the group fed the higher amount of FB), ALAT, and LDH. The broiler chickens had no visible leg lesions and no problem in the locomotor function, but the tibiae were lighter mainly in birds fed the higher concentration of FB seeds.

It seems that faba bean (FB) seeds could be a good protein-energy component in animal feed, but the presence of anti-nutritional substances limits their use as a substitute of soybean meal. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of different concentrations of raw, low-tannin, FB seeds on the gut-bone axis in Ross 308 broilers. One-day old chickens were randomly subjected to one of the 3 dietary treatments: the control group was fed standard diet based on soybean meal and without FB seeds, and two groups were fed 8%/15% and 16%/22% of raw low-tannin FB seeds in the starter and grower, respectively. On the 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, hematological and serum biochemical analyses as well histomorphometry of the small intestine and liver tissue and bone mechanical tests were performed. The diet type had no effect on the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. However, the basal intestinal structures were significantly reduced in birds fed the lower concentration of FB. The enlargement of nerve plexuses was dependent on the concentration used in the diet and, additionally, on the kind of plexus and location in the intestinal tract. The liver was characterized by an increase in non-hepatocytes. There was no influence of the low-tannin FB seeds on most of the analyzed serum parameters in the 35-day-old broiler chickens, except the decreased concentration of total cholesterol and Ca in both experimental groups, triglycerides in group I, and P and uric acid in group II. Furthermore, the increasing concentration of the dietary low-tannin FB did not influence the activities of AspAT (except the group fed the higher amount of FB), ALAT, and LDH. The broiler chickens had no visible leg lesions and no problem in the locomotor function, but the tibiae were lighter mainly in birds fed the higher concentration of FB seeds. Geometric analysis revealed reduction of the cross section area and wall thickness, indicating a decline in the bone midshaft, which influenced the densitometric parameters and the results of mechanical tests. In conclusion, the dietary inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seeds had no negative effects on broiler growth, but disturbed the intestine structure and tibia characteristics. Therefore, all these negative effects necessitate additional examinations before inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seed into poultry diet.</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286260v2?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286260v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286260v2?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/04/286260</canonicalUrl><author><name>Wohlers, I.</name></author><published>1522825200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522864432648</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic risk loci for autoimmune diseases.

Distance between rows and plants are essential parameters that affect the final grain yield in row crops. This paper presents the results of research intended to develop a novel method to quantify the distance between maize plants at field scale using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Using this method, we can recognize maize plants as objects and calculate the distance between plants. We initially developed our method by training an algorithm in an indoor facility with plastic corn plants. Then, the method was scaled up and tested in a farmer‚Äôs field with maize plant spacing that exhibited natural variation. The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to precisely quantify the distance between maize plants. We found that accuracy of the measurement of the distance between maize plants depended on the height above ground level at which UAV imagery was taken. This study provides an innovative approach to quantify plant-to-plant variability and, thereby final crop yield estimates.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f2:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Estimating plant distance in maize using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)</title><fingerprint>f0fe591b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinshui Zhang, Bruno Basso, Richard F.

In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) digitization technique for natural objects, such as insects and plants. The key idea is to combine X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photographs to obtain both complicated 3D shapes and surface textures of target specimens. We measure a specimen by using an X-ray CT device and a digital camera to obtain a CT volumetric image (volume) and multiple photographs. We then reconstruct a 3D model by segmenting the CT volume and generate a texture by projecting the photographs onto the model. To achieve this reconstruction, we introduce a technique for estimating a camera position for each photograph. We also present techniques for merging multiple textures generated from multiple photographs and recovering missing texture areas caused by occlusion. We illustrate the feasibility of our 3D digitization technique by digitizing 3D textured models of insects and flowers. The combination of X-ray CT and a digital camera makes it possible to successfully digitize specimens with complicated 3D structures accurately and allows us to browse both surface colors and internal structures.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d3:9f3b30f2</id><title>Digitization of natural objects with micro CT and photographs</title><fingerprint>76ea1616</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ijiri, Hideki Todo, Akira Hirabayashi, Kenji Kohiyama, Yoshinori Dobashi&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to systematically review the range, nature, and extent of current research activity exploring the influence of innovative health-related technologies on social inequalities in health, with specific focus on a deeper understanding of the variables used to measure this connection and the pathways leading to the (re)production of inequalities. A review process was conducted, based on scoping review techniques, searching literature published from January 1, 1996 to November 25, 2016 using MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Search, sorting, and data extraction processes were conducted by a team of researchers and experts using a dynamic, reflexive examination process. Of 4139 studies collected from the search process, a total of 33 were included in the final analysis. Results of this study include the classification of technologies based on how these technologies are accessed and used by end users. In addition to the factors and mechanisms that influence unequal &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to technologies, the results of this study highlight the importance of variations in &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; that importantly shape social inequalities in health. Additionally, focus on health care services technologies must be accompanied by investigating emerging technologies influencing healthy lifestyle, genomics, and personalized devices in health. Findings also suggest that choosing one measure of social position over another has important implications for the interpretation of research results. Furthermore, understanding the pathways through which various innovative health technologies reduce or (re)produce social inequalities in health is context dependent. In order to better understand social inequalities in health, these contextual variations draw attention to the need for critical distinctions between technologies based on how these various technologies are accessed and used. The results of this study provide a comprehensive starting point for future research to further investigate how innovative technologies may influence the unequal distribution of health as a human right.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f72:34f43e70</id><title>Innovative technologies and social inequalities in health: A scoping review of the literature</title><fingerprint>a655d99</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Weiss, H√•vard T.

Currently approved monoamine modulating antidepressant and anxiolytic pharmaceutics fail in over one third of patients due to delayed and variable therapeutic effect, adverse reactions preceding the therapeutic action, and adherence issues. Even with adequate adherence to the regimen and tolerability, one third of the patients do not respond to any class of antidepressants. There is a strong correlation between treatment resistant depression and increase in inflammatory cytokines in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with pain and inflammation. While a link between pain, inflammation and depression has been suggested it remains unclear which anti-inflammatory treatment may be beneficial to patients with depression and anxiety due to pain. Here, we analyzed 430,783 FDA adverse effect reports of patients treated for pain to identify potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of various anti-inflammatory medications. Patients treated for depression or patients taking any known antidepressants were excluded. The odds ratio analysis of 139,072 NSAID reports revealed that ketoprofen was associated with decreased reports of depression by a factor of 2.32 (OR 0.43 and 95% Confidence Interval [0.31, 0.59]) and decreased reports of anxiety by a factor of 2.86 (OR 0.35 [0.22, 0.56]), diclofenac with decreased depression reports by a factor of 2.22 (OR 0.45 [0.40, 0.49]) and anxiety by a factor of 2.13 (OR 0.47 [0.41, 0.54]), while naproxen decreased depression reports by a factor of 1.92 (OR 0.52 [0.49, 0.57]) and anxiety by a factor of 1.23 (OR 0.81 [0.75, 0.88]). Other NSAIDs did not exhibit any noticeable antidepressant and/or anxiolytic effect.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccad:34f43e70</id><title>Population scale retrospective analysis reveals distinctive antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of diclofenac, ketoprofen and naproxen in patients with pain</title><fingerprint>71734325</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tigran Makunts, Isaac V.

Currently approved monoamine modulating antidepressant and anxiolytic pharmaceutics fail in over one third of patients due to delayed and variable therapeutic effect, adverse reactions preceding the therapeutic action, and adherence issues. Even with adequate adherence to the regimen and tolerability, one third of the patients do not respond to any class of antidepressants. There is a strong correlation between treatment resistant depression and increase in inflammatory cytokines in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with pain and inflammation.

Dietary intake of barley Œ≤-glucan (BG) is known to affect energy metabolism. However, its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood because studies have presented inconsistent results, with both positive and negative effects reported in terms of satiety, energy intake, weight loss, and glycemic control. The objective of this study was to clarify the physiological role underlying the metabolic benefits of barley BG using a mouse model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Male 4-wk-old C57BL/6J mice were fed an HFD with 20% barley flour containing either high BG (HBG; 2% BG) or low BG (LBG; 0.6% BG) levels under conventional and germ-free (GF) conditions for 12 wks. In addition, mice were fed either an HFD with 5% cellulose (HFC; high fiber cellulose) or 5% barley BG (HFB; high fiber Œ≤-glucan) for 12 wks. Then, metabolic parameters, gut microbial compositions, and the production of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were analyzed. The weight gain and fat mass of HBG-fed mice were lower than those of control mice at 16-wk-old. Moreover, the secretion of the gut hormones PYY and GLP-1 increased in HBG-fed mice, thereby reducing food intake and improving insulin sensitivity by changing the gut microbiota and increasing SCFAs (especially, butyrate) under conventional condition. These effects in HBG-fed mice were abolished under GF conditions. Moreover, the HFB diets also increased PYY and GLP-1 secretion, and decreased food intake compared with that in HFC-fed mice. These results suggest that the beneficial metabolic effects of barley BG are primary due to the suppression of appetite and improvement of insulin sensitivity, which are induced by gut hormone secretion promoted via gut microbiota-produced SCFAs.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7e:fc1f8953</id><title>Barley Œ≤-glucan improves metabolic condition via short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbial fermentation in high fat diet fed mice</title><fingerprint>ea2c520d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junki Miyamoto, Keita Watanabe, Satsuki Taira, Mayu Kasubuchi, Xuan Li, Junichiro Irie, Hiroshi Itoh, Ikuo Kimura&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the first step toward developing preventative strategies and optimizing care systems. We aimed to describe and compare epidemiological features and clinical outcomes among patients with anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs according to causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified emergency medical service (EMS)-treated anaphylaxis-associated OHCA patients from a nationwide OHCA registry between 2008 and 2015. We compared epidemiological characteristics and outcomes according to causal agents (a natural agents group and an iatrogenic agents group) and evaluated temporal variability in incidence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare survival to discharge between causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the study period (8 years), the total number of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs was 233. A total of 224 eligible cases were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients (85.6%) in the natural agents group and 32 patients (14.3%) in the iatrogenic agents group. There was significant diurnal and seasonal variability in the frequency of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values&amp;lt;0.01 for both), with the highest incidences occurring during the day (7:01 am to 3 pm; 64.6%) and in summer (June to August, 48.7%). Compared with the natural agents group, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for survival to discharge in the iatrogenic agents group was statistically insignificant (AOR 3.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 15.06).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is considerably low, and significant temporal variability, with a peak during the day and in summer, is evident.

Isolated mitochondria are widely used to study the function of the organelle. Typically, mitochondria are prepared using differential centrifugation alone or in conjunction with density gradient ultracentrifugation. However, mitochondria isolated using differential centrifugation contain membrane or organelle contaminants, and further purification of crude mitochondria by density gradient ultracentrifugation requires large amounts of starting material, and is time-consuming. Mitochondria have also been isolated by irreversible binding to antibody-coated magnetic beads. We developed a method to prepare mitochondria from budding yeast that overcomes many of the limitations of other methods. Mitochondria are tagged by insertion of 6 histidines (6xHis) into the &lt;i&gt;TOM70&lt;/i&gt; (Translocase of outer membrane 70) gene at its chromosomal locus, isolated using Ni-NTA (nickel (II) nitrilotriacetic acid) paramagnetic beads and released from the magnetic beads by washing with imidazole. Mitochondria prepared using this method contain fewer contaminants, and are similar in ultrastructure as well as protein import and cytochrome c oxidase complex activity compared to mitochondria isolated by differential centrifugation. Moreover, this isolation method is amenable to small samples, faster than purification by differential and density gradient centrifugation, and more cost-effective than purification using antibody-coated magnetic beads. Importantly, this method can be applied to any cell type where the genetic modification can be introduced by CRISPR or other methods.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefbe:11c251fd</id><title>Isolation of mitochondria from &amp;lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&amp;lt;/i&gt; using magnetic bead affinity purification</title><fingerprint>a09b0a6d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pin-Chao Liao, Istvan R.

As many similar symptoms are reported in fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), underlying defcits may potentially also be similar. Postural disequilibrium reported in both conditions may thus be explained by similar deviations in postural control strategies. 75 females (25/group FM, CFS and control, age 19‚Äì49 years) performed 60 s of quiet standing on a force platform in each of three conditions: 1) firm surface with vision, 2) firm surface without vision and, 3) compliant surface with vision. Migration of center of pressure was decomposed into a slow and a fast component denoting postural sway and lateral forces controlling postural sway, analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Main effects of group for the antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions showed that patients displayed larger amplitudes (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.021) and lower frequencies (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) for the slow component, as well as for the fast component (amplitudes: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001 and frequencies: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029) compared to controls. Post hoc analyses showed no significant differences between patient groups. In conclusion, both the CFS- and the FM-group differed from the control group. Larger postural sway and insufficient control was found in patients compared to controls, with no significant differences between the two patient groups.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f0:34f43e70</id><title>Lower regulatory frequency for postural control in patients with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome</title><fingerprint>1c1055c0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Omid Rasouli, Ottar Vasseljen, Egil A.

As many similar symptoms are reported in fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), underlying defcits may potentially also be similar. Postural disequilibrium reported in both conditions may thus be explained by similar deviations in postural control strategies. 75 females (25/group FM, CFS and control, age 19‚Äì49 years) performed 60 s of quiet standing on a force platform in each of three conditions: 1) firm surface with vision, 2) firm surface without vision and, 3) compliant surface with vision.

In health sector, trust is considered important because it indirectly influences the quality of health care through patient satisfaction, adherence and the continuity of its relationship with health care professionals and the promotion of accurate and timely diagnoses. One of the important requirements of TRSs in the health sector is rating secrecy, which mandates that the identification information about the service consumer should be kept secret to prevent any privacy violation. Anonymity and trust are two imperative objectives, and no significant explicit efforts have been made to achieve both of them at the same time. In this paper, we present a framework for solving the problem of reconciling trust with anonymity in the health sector. Our solution comprises Anonymous &lt;i&gt;Reputation Management&lt;/i&gt; (ARM) protocol and &lt;i&gt;Context-aware Trustworthiness Assessment&lt;/i&gt; (CTA) protocol. ARM protocol ensures that only those service consumers who received a service from a specific service provider provide a recommendation score anonymously with in the specified time limit. The CTA protocol computes the reputation of a user as a service provider and as a recommender. To determine the correctness of the proposed ARM protocol, formal modelling and verification are performed using High Level Petri Nets (HLPN) and Z3 Solver. Our simulation results verify the accuracy of the proposed context-aware trust assessment scheme.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7132:34f43e70</id><title>Anonymity-preserving Reputation Management System for health sector</title><fingerprint>4913f262</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farhana Jabeen, Zara Hamid, Wadood Abdul, Sanaa Ghouzali, Abid Khan, Saif Ur Rehman Malik, Mansoor Shaukat Khan, Sarfraz Nawaz&lt;/p&gt;

Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power‚Äìintegrated information (Œ¶), and showing that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for Œ¶ across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible &lt;i&gt;black boxes&lt;/i&gt;. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Œ¶ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Œ¶ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nmwWC-o9ix4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392bb:a077e55f</id><title>Black-boxing and cause-effect power</title><fingerprint>bc7400d5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Giulio Tononi&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was aimed at a serial evaluation and comparison of the prognostic values of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores for neurologic outcomes in comatose, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors, treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analysed a prospective cohort of comatose OHCA patients, with TTM, admitted to an emergency intensive care unit (ICU), between January 2010 and December 2015. SOFA and APACHE II scores were calculated initially, and then at day 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after ICU admission. Primary and secondary outcomes were the 28-day neurologic outcome and the 28-day mortality, respectively. Prognostic value of the SOFA and APACHE II scores was analysed using the receiver operating characteristic curve.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 143 selected patients, 62 survived and 34 had good neurologic outcomes at day 28. There was no significant difference in the SOFA and extracerebral SOFA scores between the good and poor neurologic outcome groups. However, the APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the good outcome group; they displayed good discriminatory power in predicting poor outcomes, unlike the SOFA scores. The APACHE II score at day 3 had the highest prognostic value for predicting poor neurologic outcomes with an area under the cure of 0.793, and with a cut-off value of 20, the APACHE II score predicted poor neurologic outcomes with a sensitivity of 43.75%, a specificity of 94.12%, a positive predictive value of 94.59%, and a negative predictive value of 41.56%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Identifying APACHE II score might assist as one piece of multimodal prognostic approach for the assessment of neurologic outcomes in OHCA survivors treated with TTM.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d749:9f3b30f2</id><title>Serial evaluation of SOFA and APACHE II scores to predict neurologic outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with targeted temperature management</title><fingerprint>5d87e8eb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Chol Yoon, Youn-Jung Kim, You-Jin Lee, Seung Mok Ryoo, Chang Hwan Sohn, Dong-Woo Seo, Yoon-Seon Lee, Jae Ho Lee, Kyoung Soo Lim, Won Young Kim&lt;/p&gt;

This research identifies which shots types in goalball are most likely to lead to a goal and herby provides background information for improving training and competition. Therefore, we observed 117 elite level matches including 20,541 shots played in the regular situation (3 vs. 3) using notational analysis. We characterized the shots by using their target sector (A-E), technique (traditional, rotation), trajectory (flat, bounce), angle (straight, diagonal and outcome (goal, violation, out, blocked). In our data, a œá&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-test showed a significantly higher goal rate for men (3.9%) compared to women (3.0%). For men, we found a significantly higher goal rate in the intersection sectors between players C (5.6%), D (4.9%), and in the outer sector A. In sector A, goal rate was higher only for straight shots (6.6%). Technique and trajectory did not affect goal rate for men, but flat shots showed a higher violation rate (3.2%) compared to bounce shouts (2.0%). In women&apos;s goalball, goal rate was higher only on sector D (4.4%). Bounce-rotation shots were the most successful (5.5%). We conclude that men should focus on shots to sectors C and D (called pocket) and straight shots to sector A, as long as there are no other tactical considerations. Women should shoot primarily towards the pocket. It might also be worth playing more bounce-rotation shots and practicing them in training.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefc4:11c251fd</id><title>Finding the gap: An empirical study of the most effective shots in elite goalball</title><fingerprint>aefefdd4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Link, Christoph Weber&lt;/p&gt;

This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in biological and engineered systems, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25137?af=R</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 12, Page 705-710, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25137?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25137?af=R</originId><published>1522122370699</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522122370699</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/12&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, Page 705-710, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_16265902e8b:6ce25:76251cdd</id><fingerprint>662f15b5</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 12, Page 705-710, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3230.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3230.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3230.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3230</canonicalUrl><author><name>Yonghong Liu, Yuanyuan Liu, Jiaming Wu, Bernard Roizman, Grace Guoying Zhou</name></author><published>1522774667000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522778515834</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Analyses of the levels of mRNAs encoding IFIT1, IFI16, RIG-1, MDA5, CXCL10, LGP2, PUM1, LSD1, STING, and IFNŒ≤ in cell lines from which the gene encoding LGP2, LSD1, PML, HDAC4, IFI16, PUM1, STING, MDA5, IRF3, or HDAC 1 had been knocked out, as well as the ability of these cell...</content></content><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1628cac297a:9554bbb:34f43e70</id><title>Innate responses to gene knockouts impact overlapping gene networks and vary with respect to resistance to viral infection [Immunology and Inflammation]</title><fingerprint>c2823680</fingerprint><description>Analyses of the levels of mRNAs encoding IFIT1, IFI16, RIG-1, MDA5, CXCL10, LGP2, PUM1, LSD1, STING, and IFNŒ≤ in cell lines from which the gene encoding LGP2, LSD1, PML, HDAC4, IFI16, PUM1, STING, MDA5, IRF3, or HDAC 1 had been knocked out, as well as the ability of these cell...</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194612</link><updated>1522098000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194612</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Ranjit Chauhan</name></author><unread>False</unread><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194612</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1522098000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ranjit Chauhan, David Datzkiw, Shailly Varma Shrivastav, Anuraag Shrivastav&lt;/p&gt;
Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective. This study provides the groundwork for future studies concerning NMT-transcript-binding miRNAs, and will potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several important diseases.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5e9:7d6c1c1c</id><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;In silico&amp;lt;/i&gt; identification of microRNAs predicted to regulate N-myristoyltransferase and Methionine Aminopeptidase 2 functions in cancer and infectious diseases</title><fingerprint>d2096ec8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ranjit Chauhan, David Datzkiw, Shailly Varma Shrivastav, Anuraag Shrivastav&lt;/p&gt;

Our study shows that the surface states of FeTe&lt;sub&gt;0.55&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.45&lt;/sub&gt; are topologically superconducting, providing a simple and possibly high-temperature platform for realizing Majorana states.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04967-8</link><engagementRate>0.02</engagementRate><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04967-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04967-8/d41586-018-04967-8_15708874.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04967-8</originId><published>1524553200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>2</engagement><crawled>1524583547280</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arctic ice carries heavy freight of plastic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arctic ice carries heavy freight of plastic, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04967-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04967-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Many of the microplastic particles in northern sea ice originated thousands of kilometres to the south.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162f842c190:68146e8:34f43e70</id><title>Arctic ice carries heavy freight of plastic</title><fingerprint>b34236ad</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arctic ice carries heavy freight of plastic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arctic ice carries heavy freight of plastic, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04967-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04967-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Many of the microplastic particles in northern sea ice originated thousands of kilometres to the south.</description></item><item><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24888?af=R</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24888?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>False</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24888?af=R</originId><published>1522120810699</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522120810699</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162657860cb:6ce18:76251cdd</id><fingerprint>ebbd524d</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01284</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.7b01284/20180411/images/medium/bi-2017-01284q_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01284&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

We analyse the behaviour of a non-linear model of coupled stock and bond prices exhibiting periodically collapsing bubbles. By using the formalism of dynamical system theory, we explain what drives the bubbles and how foreshocks or aftershocks are generated. A dynamical phase space representation of that system coupled with standard multiplicative noise rationalises the log-periodic power law singularity pattern documented in many historical financial bubbles. The notion of ‚Äòghosts of finite-time singularities‚Äô is introduced and used to estimate the end of an evolving bubble, using finite-time singularities of an approximate normal form near the bifurcation point. We test the forecasting skill of this method on different stochastic price realisations and compare with Monte Carlo simulations of the full system. Remarkably, the approximate normal form is significantly more precise and less biased. Moreover, the method of ghosts of singularities is less sensitive to the noise realisation, thus providing more robust forecasts.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde31:9f3b30f2</id><title>Predicting financial market crashes using ghost singularities</title><fingerprint>be8252c3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Damian Smug, Peter Ashwin, Didier Sornette&lt;/p&gt;

One of the more fundamental health policy questions is the relationship between health care quality and spending. A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46). Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5c:34f43e70</id><title>Association between quality domains and health care spending across physician networks</title><fingerprint>13e993e5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farah Rahman, Jun Guan, Richard H.

Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures.</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E3932.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E3932.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E3932.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E3932</canonicalUrl><author><name>Maria C.

We present a fast, robust and parsimonious approach to detecting signals in an ordered sequence of numbers. Our motivation is in seeking a suitable method to take a sequence of scores corresponding to properties of positions in virus genomes, and find outlying regions of low scores. Suitable statistical methods without using complex models or making many assumptions are surprisingly lacking. We resolve this by developing a method that detects regions of low score within sequences of real numbers. The method makes no assumptions &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; about the length of such a region; it gives the explicit location of the region and scores it statistically. It does not use detailed mechanistic models so the method is fast and will be useful in a wide range of applications. We present our approach in detail, and test it on simulated sequences. We show that it is robust to a wide range of signal morphologies, and that it is able to capture multiple signals in the same sequence. Finally we apply it to viral genomic data to identify regions of evolutionary conservation within influenza and rotavirus.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179362c:7d6c1c1c</id><title>A new method for detecting signal regions in ordered sequences of real numbers, and application to viral genomic data</title><fingerprint>8e3101ff</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julia R.

In this study, individuals estimated interval times of several minutes (from 2 to 32 minutes) during their everyday lives using a cell phone they kept with them. Their emotional state, the difficulty of the activity performed during this interval, and the attention that it required were also assessed, together with their subjective experience of the passage of time. The results showed that the mean time estimates and their variability increased linearly with increasing interval duration, indicating that the fundamental scalar property of time found for short durations also applies to very long durations of several minutes. In addition, the emotional state and difficulty of the activity were significant predictors of the judgment of long durations. However, the awareness of the passage of time appeared to play a crucial role in the judgment of very long duration in humans. A theory on the emergence of the awareness of the passage of time and how it affects the judgment of interval durations lasting several minutes is therefore discussed.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6e:34f43e70</id><title>The explicit judgment of long durations of several minutes in everyday life: Conscious retrospective memory judgment and the role of affects?</title><fingerprint>a61dd276</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sylvie Droit-Volet, Sophie Monceau, Micka√´l Berthon, Panos Trahanias, Michail Maniadakis&lt;/p&gt;

How will coastal soils in areas newly flooded with seawater function as habitat for benthic marine organisms? This research question is highly relevant as global sea level rise and coastal realignment will cause flooding of soils and form new marine habitats. In this study, we tested experimentally the capacity of common marine polychaetes, &lt;i&gt;Marenzelleria viridis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nereis (Hediste) diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scoloplos armiger&lt;/i&gt; to colonize and modify the biogeochemistry of the newly established Gyldensteen Coastal Lagoon, Denmark. All tested polychaetes survived relatively well (28‚Äì89%) and stimulated carbon dioxide release (TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by 97‚Äì105% when transferred to newly flooded soils, suggesting that soil characteristics are modified rapidly by colonizing fauna. A field survey showed that the pioneering benthic community inside the lagoon was structurally different from the marine area outside the lagoon, and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;viridis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armiger&lt;/i&gt; were not among the early colonizers. These were instead &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Polydora cornuta&lt;/i&gt; with an abundance of 1603 and 540 ind m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Considering the species-specific effects of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; on TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release and its average abundance in the lagoon, we estimate that organic carbon degradation was increased by 219% in the first year of flooding.

Quintana, Sandra W. Thorsen, Erik Kristensen&lt;/p&gt;
How will coastal soils in areas newly flooded with seawater function as habitat for benthic marine organisms? This research question is highly relevant as global sea level rise and coastal realignment will cause flooding of soils and form new marine habitats. In this study, we tested experimentally the capacity of common marine polychaetes, &lt;i&gt;Marenzelleria viridis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nereis (Hediste) diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scoloplos armiger&lt;/i&gt; to colonize and modify the biogeochemistry of the newly established Gyldensteen Coastal Lagoon, Denmark. All tested polychaetes survived relatively well (28‚Äì89%) and stimulated carbon dioxide release (TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by 97‚Äì105% when transferred to newly flooded soils, suggesting that soil characteristics are modified rapidly by colonizing fauna. A field survey showed that the pioneering benthic community inside the lagoon was structurally different from the marine area outside the lagoon, and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;viridis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armiger&lt;/i&gt; were not among the early colonizers. These were instead &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Polydora cornuta&lt;/i&gt; with an abundance of 1603 and 540 ind m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Considering the species-specific effects of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; on TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release and its average abundance in the lagoon, we estimate that organic carbon degradation was increased by 219% in the first year of flooding. We therefore conclude that early colonizing polychaetes modify the soils and may play an important role in the ecological and successional developments, e.g. C cycling and biodiversity, in newly flooded coastal ecosystems. Newly flooded soils have thus a strong potential to develop into well-functioning marine ecosystems.</description></item><item><link>https://www.journals.elsevier.com/medical-image-analysis/news/physics-workshops-in-collaboration-with-the-world-science-fe</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;

The high risk of experiencing domestic violence (DV) among married women in India who reside in slum communities underscores the need for effective, evidence-based, and culturally-tailored primary prevention. To inform such DV primary prevention strategies for this population, we herein aimed to identify correlates of DV experience in early marriage. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, potential correlates of DV experience were explored among a geographically-clustered random sample of 100 recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India. In multivariable regression, DV experience was associated with less educational attainment by the participant‚Äôs spouse (standardized Œ≤ = -0.281, p = 0.004), less satisfaction of the spouse‚Äôs family with the &lt;i&gt;maanpaan&lt;/i&gt; (wedding-related gifts provided by the bride‚Äôs family) they received at the time of marriage (standardized Œ≤ = -0.298, p&amp;lt;0.001), poorer conflict negotiation skills (standardized Œ≤ = -0.308, p&amp;lt;0.001), and greater acknowledgement of DV occurrence in family and friends (standardized Œ≤ = 0.436, p&amp;lt;0.001). These correlates suggest strategies that could be incorporated into future DV primary prevention interventions for this vulnerable population (i.e. promoting completion of formal education of boys alongside girls, mitigating causes of familial dowry harassment, improving conflict negotiation skills, and challenging norms surrounding DV).</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76923:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Correlates of domestic violence experience among recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India</title><fingerprint>44227742</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ameeta S.

HaploJuice achieves high accuracy in haplotype reconstruction, making Ranjard et al.&apos;s pooling strategy more efficient, feasible, and applicable, with the benefit of reducing the sequencing cost.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195269</link><updated>1522875600000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195269</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Vincent Kalumire Cubaka</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195269</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195269</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1522875600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vincent Kalumire Cubaka, Michael Schriver, Philip Cotton, Laetitia Nyirazinyoye, Per Kallestrup&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Delivery of effective healthcare is contingent on the quality of communication between the patient and the healthcare provider. Little is known about primary healthcare providers‚Äô perceptions of communication with patients in Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To explore providers‚Äô perceptions of patient-provider communication (PPC) and analyse the ways in which providers present and reflect on communication practice and problems.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Qualitative, in-depth, semi structured interviews with nine primary health care providers. An abductive analysis supplemented by the framework method was applied. A narrative approach allowed the emergence of archetypical narratives on PPC.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Providers shared rich reflections on the importance of proper communication with patients and appeared committed to making their interaction work optimally. Still, providers had difficulty critically analysing limitations of their communication in practice. Reported communication issues included lack of communication training as well as time and workload issues. Two archetypes of narratives on PPC issues and practice emerged and are discussed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;While providers‚Äô narratives put patients at the centre of care, there were indications that patient-provider communication training and practice need further development. In-depth exploration of highlighted issues and adapted strategies to tackle communication drawbacks are prerequisites to improvement.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although increased serum IgG4 level and tissue infiltration of IgG4-positive cells are key events in IgG4-related disease (IgG4RD), and nearly half of IgG4RD patients show hypocomplementemia, the role of IgG4 in the pathogenesis of IgG4RD remains unclear. Many reports show that altered IgG glycosylation, especially IgG with agalactosylated N-linked glycan (G0 N-glycan), have proinflammatory roles including complement activation, implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. This study determined the concentration of N-linked glycans (N-glycan) released from serum IgG4 in IgG4RD patients and compared the difference of glycosylation changes to those in healthy controls. We also compared the concentration of each IgG4 glycoform between patients with and without hypocomplementemia and individual organ involvement (kidney, pancreas, lymph node) in IgG4RD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We collected sera from 12 IgG4RD patients and 8 healthy controls. IgG4 was isolated from sera via Melon‚Ñ¢ Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit followed by Capture Select IgG4 (Hu) Affinity Matrix. IgG4 N-glycans were analyzed by S-BIO Glycan&lt;i&gt;Map&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;¬Æ&lt;/sup&gt; Xpress methodology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significant increases of IgG4 G0 N-glycan and IgG4 fucosylated N-glycan (F1 N-glycan) concentrations were observed in IgG4RD compared with healthy controls. Although we observed decreased levels of IgG4 F0 glycan in IgG4RD with hypocomplementemia, there were no significant differences in the galactosylation and sialyation of IgG4 N-glycans. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the glycosylation of IgG4 N-glycans between patients with and without individual organ involvement of IgG4RD.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although IgG4 has anti-inflammatory properties, IgG4 G0 and F1 glycans were increased in patients with IgG4RD. Our results suggest that decreased galactosylation of IgG4 is not related to complement activation and the differences of individual organ involvement in IgG4RD. IgG4 fucosylation change may be related to complement activation in IgG4RD. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of IgG4 in IgG4RD.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935cd:9f3b30f2</id><title>Changes in N-glycans of IgG4 and its relationship with the existence of hypocomplementemia and individual organ involvement in patients with IgG4-related disease</title><fingerprint>d570daa1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naoki Konno, Mitsuru Sugimoto, Tadayuki Takagi, Makiko Furuya, Tomoyuki Asano, Shuzo Sato, Hiroko Kobayashi, Kiyoshi Migita, Yoshiaki Miura, Taichi Aihara, Atsushi Komatsuda, Hiromasa Ohira, Hiroshi Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;

Vitellogenesis is the process of yolk formation via accumulating vitellin (Vn) with nutrients in the oocytes. Expression of vitellogenin (Vg), the precursor of Vn, is one of the indicators for the start of vitellogenesis. In Pacific white shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Litopenaeus vannamei&lt;/i&gt;), the type-II vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone (VIH-2) effectively suppresses hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression. In this study, we demonstrate the increasing transcript levels of hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; during &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vannamei&lt;/i&gt; ovarian development, suggesting that the hepatopancreas-derived Vg/Vn may also contribute to vitellogenesis in this species. Using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; injections and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; primary cell cultures, we provide evidences that the inhibition of VIH-2 on hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; gene expression is mediated through a functional coupling of the GC/cGMP pathway with different MAPK-dependent cascades in female shrimp. In VIH-2 signaling, the NO-independent GC/cGMP/PKG cascades were upstream of the MAPKs. Activations of the MAPK signal by VIH-2 include the phosphorylation of JNK and the mRNA/protein expression of P&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;MAPK. Additionally, the cAMP/PKA pathway is another positive intracellular signal for hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression but is independent of its VIH-2 regulation. Our findings establish a model for the signal transduction mechanism of Vg regulation by VIH and shed light on the biological functions and signaling of the CHH family in crustaceans.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad281d:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Mechanisms for type-II vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone suppression of vitellogenin transcription in shrimp hepatopancreas: Crosstalk of GC/cGMP pathway with different MAPK-dependent cascades</title><fingerprint>c778e75b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ting Chen, Chunhua Ren, Xiao Jiang, Lvping Zhang, Hongmei Li, Wen Huang, Chaoqun Hu&lt;/p&gt;

Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) to prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain. Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities. It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood. Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95). We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users. LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011 and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019 respectively). 20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.040) but not women. Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE. These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae6d:fc1f8953</id><title>Celecoxib use and circulating oxylipins in a colon polyp prevention trial</title><fingerprint>21014197</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Estimating mortality risk during TB treatment in HIV co-infected patients is challenging for health professionals, especially in a low TB prevalence population, due to the lack of a standardized prognostic system. The current study aimed to develop and validate a simple mortality prognostic scoring system for TB/HIV co-infected patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the CDC‚Äôs Tuberculosis Genotyping Information Management System of TB patients in Texas reported from 01/2010 through 12/2016, age ‚â•15 years, HIV(+), and outcome being ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù or ‚Äúdied‚Äù, we developed and internally validated a mortality prognostic score using multiple logistic regression. Model discrimination was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The model‚Äôs good calibration was determined by a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow‚Äôs goodness of fit test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 450 patients included in the analysis, 57 (12.7%) died during TB treatment.

Background &lt;p&gt;Estimating mortality risk during TB treatment in HIV co-infected patients is challenging for health professionals, especially in a low TB prevalence population, due to the lack of a standardized prognostic system. The current study aimed to develop and validate a simple mortality prognostic scoring system for TB/HIV co-infected patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the CDC‚Äôs Tuberculosis Genotyping Information Management System of TB patients in Texas reported from 01/2010 through 12/2016, age ‚â•15 years, HIV(+), and outcome being ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù or ‚Äúdied‚Äù, we developed and internally validated a mortality prognostic score using multiple logistic regression. Model discrimination was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The model‚Äôs good calibration was determined by a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow‚Äôs goodness of fit test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 450 patients included in the analysis, 57 (12.7%) died during TB treatment. The final prognostic score used six characteristics (age, residence in long-term care facility, meningeal TB, chest x-ray, culture positive, and culture not converted/unknown), which are routinely collected by TB programs. Prognostic scores were categorized into three groups that predicted mortality: low-risk (&amp;lt;20 points), medium-risk (20‚Äì25 points) and high-risk (&gt;25 points). The model had good discrimination and calibration (AUC = 0.82; 0.80 in bootstrap validation), and a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test p = 0.71.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our simple validated mortality prognostic scoring system can be a practical tool for health professionals in identifying TB/HIV co-infected patients with high mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04881-z</link><engagementRate>19.13</engagementRate><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04881-z</originId><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04881-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><author><name>Jack Leeming</name></author><published>1524639600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>861</engagement><crawled>1524662075156</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A photo celebration of scientists at work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A photo celebration of scientists at work, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04881-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04881-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In this year&apos;s contest, Nature follows scientists from starry Antarctic fields to African volcanic plains.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162fcf0ff14:3fc0e2:9f3b30f2</id><title>A photo celebration of scientists at work</title><fingerprint>5613d6ec</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A photo celebration of scientists at work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A photo celebration of scientists at work, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04881-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04881-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In this year&apos;s contest, Nature follows scientists from starry Antarctic fields to African volcanic plains.</description></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293381v2?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293381v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293381v2?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/10/293381</canonicalUrl><author><name>Martorell-Marugan, J.</name></author><published>1523343600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523385227101</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: The identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among phenotypes is one of the main goals of epigenetic analysis.

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162ab8d3c72:d9a76:a077e55f</id><title>Spatial modeling of the membrane-cytosolic interface in protein kinase signal transduction</title><fingerprint>55f062a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schr√∂der, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

I say that because I‚Äôve been actively reading the chemical literature for over thirty years now, and I still keep running across topics that I never knew existed. One of these popped up the other day: racemic protein crystallography. Now there may be a few readers who are all ‚ÄúOh yeah, sure, you‚Äôre just getting around to that?‚Äù, but for everyone else, think about that term for a minute. Prepare yourself for a weird excursion into chirality and crystallinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein crystallography, sure ‚Äì great stuff, although known to be¬†&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/05/more-on-crystal-formation-this-time-with-proteins&quot;&gt;infested with voodoo&lt;/a&gt; and all that. But racemic? The idea of a racemic protein is a bit weird, because that means a 50/50 mix of enantiomers, and proteins are, of course, pretty much all made up of the naturally (L) amino acids that living cells use crank them out. To get an all (D) protein, you‚Äôd have to have a supply of all those unnatural enantiomeric amino acids (which you can buy, albeit not so cheaply). But you‚Äôre not going to be able to depend on any cells or ribosomes to make them for you, since we don‚Äôt have any mirror-image life handy, so chemical synthesis it is. And that‚Äôs doable, too (although the larger the protein chain, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2006/07/19/fuzeons_fallout&quot;&gt;trickier&lt;/a&gt; it gets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next question you might have is why anyone would want to go to all the trouble. And there we get into some crystallography. If you look at all the basic ways that things can be arranged in three dimensions, with careful attention to what directions and how you‚Äôd have to move your basic units around to make them repeat, you are listing ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group&quot;&gt;space groups&lt;/a&gt;‚Äú. And here chemistry (and physics) impinge on pure mathematics, because good ol‚Äô three-dimensional space has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_groups&quot;&gt;230 different space groups&lt;/a&gt;: that‚Äôs all there are and there ain‚Äôt no more. There are several different ways to arrange them and more than several notations for them, as that last link will show you, but mathematically, that‚Äôs what we have to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sit around your whole career crystallizing things, you will eventually encounter every single one of them, although (to be sure) there are definitely more and less common ones. But if you do nothing but crystallize proteins, you poor person you, then you will only encounter 65 of them at most. Those are the chiral space groups that don‚Äôt have any of the slightly fancier symmetries in them, such as inversion centers or mirror reflections, because chiral protein chains simply cannot be arranged in ways that will allow those things to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as it turns out, if you look at all the protein crystals known and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nsb1295-1062&quot;&gt;bin them out&lt;/a&gt; into those 65 space groups, the &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; group is pretty heavily over-represented, and a few others are right behind it. That link goes into what seems like the explanation: entropy. Those space groups allow for more degrees of freedom, which means that there are (in most cases) simply more opportunities for proteins to fall into that sort of pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you were to go to racemic proteins and crystallize those, you end up with 165 possible space groups, which means that crystallization should, in fact, be easier in general (since there are more ways for it to happen). And since protein crystallization (as it stands) can be a barren wasteland of heartbreak, this is good news. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101123&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; for globular proteins are that about 30% of them can be crystallized through brute-force experimentation, but only about two-thirds of those crystals, at best, give enough high-quality diffraction data to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-biophys-050511-102333&quot;&gt;really does look&lt;/a&gt; like the success rates for racemic crystallization are higher: greater than 85%, actually, which is just unheard of. An outstanding example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitin&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively small and very biologically important protein that is a &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; pain to crystallize. Its structure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283687906796?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;was determined&lt;/a&gt; in 1987, but as I understand it, almost everyone who studied its crystalline form since then did so by obtaining seed crystals from that original successful team (!) Synthesis of the enantiomeric protein made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.201600101&quot;&gt;dramatic difference&lt;/a&gt;: a standard screen of protein crystallization conditions on the racemate¬†&lt;em&gt;gave diffraction quality crystals in half the wells after an overnight run&lt;/em&gt;. Recently it was shown that this &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b09545&quot;&gt;even applies to&lt;/a&gt; ubiquitin oligomers, which have been considered particularly intractable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racemic-protein idea was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/342133a0&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; in 1989 and first &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.340160308&quot;&gt;achieved&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, and it‚Äôs been gathering momentum ever since. The same paper that explained the current protein space group bias predicted, through the same considerations, which new space group(s) would become the most favored as more racemic proteins were studied and according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089617304807&quot;&gt;this recent review&lt;/a&gt;, they‚Äôre right on target (between 40 and 50 examples are known to date). The prediction was also made that membrane-bound proteins might be difficult, since they have fewer protein-protein contact points than soluble proteins tend to. Work in this area is still at an early stage, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4629355/&quot;&gt;so far&lt;/a&gt; it looks like you can get X-ray structures for such things, but that they might differ (on a macro subunit-assembly level) from what occurs in the real membranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all great if you can get past the brutal synthesis part, and that last review and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117302260&quot;&gt;this shorter recent overview&lt;/a&gt; go into that issue. What‚Äôs really made the difference in recent years is ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_chemical_ligation&quot;&gt;native chemical ligation&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù chemistry on shorter (and unprotected) protein subunits. It‚Äôs still not something you undertake lightly, but it‚Äôs a lot more feasible than it used to be. And that‚Äôs a good thing: protein crystal data is extremely useful (although not quite the Word of God in all situations) and anything that allows us to get more of it, particularly in the tough cases, is welcome indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum:&lt;/em&gt; I can‚Äôt resist noting the first time I ever came across the idea of a fully enantiomeric protein, which was when I was about 14 years old and reading James Blish‚Äôs (rather odd) one-off short Star Trek novel, &lt;em&gt;Spock Must Die&lt;/em&gt;. Blish (as always) couldn‚Äôt resist working his own interests into it, so you have oddities like Uhura being a devotee of James Joyce and &lt;em&gt;Finnegan‚Äôs Wake&lt;/em&gt; in particular, which raised my eyebrows, Spock-like, even as a 14-year-old. At any rate, a key plot point is the emergency trial of a souped-up long range transporter beam that sends a copy of the person involved. Spock gets into the thing ‚Äì mind you, they should have tried it on a box lunch of roast beef sandwiches or something first, but that‚Äôs the 1960s &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äì and the beam ends up unexpectedly reflecting back and producing an apparently identical Spock, to great consternation, not least because there‚Äôs some confusion about which one is the original. One of the two ends up barricading himself inside Dr. McCoy‚Äôs laboratories for reasons unknown, and when they discover that he‚Äôs the duplicate, one proof is that they find that he‚Äôs been in there¬†&lt;em&gt;synthesizing enantiomeric proteins and carbohydrates&lt;/em&gt; in order to survive. That reflection reversed him down to his molecular chirality, you see, so. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162de5b3efe:44381c4:9f3b30f2</id><title>Mirror Proteins Come Through</title><fingerprint>b0de798b</fingerprint><description>You know, chemistry is kind of a big field.

The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is widely used to evaluate processing speed and executive function in patients with multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders. In the PASAT, subjects listen to sequences of digits while continuously reporting the sum of the last two digits presented. Four different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) are usually tested, with difficulty increasing as SOAs are reduced. Ceiling effects are common at long SOAs, while the digit delivery rate often exceeds the subject‚Äôs processing capacity at short SOAs, causing some subjects to stop performing altogether. In addition, subjects may adopt an ‚Äúalternate answer‚Äù strategy at short SOAs, which reduces the test‚Äôs demands on working-memory and processing speed. Consequently, studies have shown that the number of dyads (consecutive correct answers) is a more sensitive measure of PASAT performance than the overall number of correct sums. Here, we describe a 2.5-minute computerized test, the Dyad-Adaptive PASAT (DA-PASAT), where SOAs are adjusted with a 2:1 staircase, decreasing after each pair of correct responses and increasing after misses. Processing capacity is reflected in the minimum SOA (minSOA) achieved in 54 trials. Experiment 1 gathered normative data in two large populations: 1617 subjects in New Zealand ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, and 214 Californians ranging in age from 18 to 82 years. Minimum SOAs were influenced by age, education, and daily hours of computer-use. Minimum SOA z-scores, calculated after factoring out the influence of these factors, were virtually identical in the two control groups, as were response times (RTs) and dyad ratios (the proportion of hits occurring in dyads). Experiment 2 measured the test-retest reliability of the DA-PASAT in 44 young subjects who underwent three test sessions at weekly intervals. High intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were found for minSOAs (0.87), response times (0.76), and dyad ratios (0.87). Performance improved across test sessions for all measures. Experiment 3 investigated the effects of simulated malingering in 50 subjects: 42% of simulated malingerers produced abnormal (p&amp;lt; 0.05) minSOA z-scores. Simulated malingerers with abnormal scores were distinguished with 87% sensitivity and 69% specificity from control subjects with abnormal scores by excessive differences between training performance and the actual test. Experiment 4 investigated patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI): patients with mild TBI performed within the normal range while patients with severe TBI showed deficits. The DA-PASAT reduces the time and stress of PASAT assessment while gathering sensitive measures of dyad processing that reveal the effects of aging, malingering, and traumatic brain injury on performance.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7ea:7d6c1c1c</id><title>The Dyad-Adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (DA-PASAT): Normative data and the effects of repeated testing, simulated malingering, and traumatic brain injury</title><fingerprint>f307464d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by David L.

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f62:34f43e70</id><title>Context matters (but how and why?)

Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</description></item><item><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</originId><published>1522662194705</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522662194705</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_16285bd3e11:8aa3033:34f43e70</id><title>Quantum chemical exploration of formaldehyde clusters (H2CO)n (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ2‚Äì4)</title><fingerprint>dbe24ec4</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/366?rss=1</link><keywords><item>Atmospheric Science, Scientific Community</item></keywords><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/366?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/366?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/366.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Rosen, J.</name></author><published>1524764252000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1524766155374</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1630325226e:3dd94a:fc1f8953</id><title>Robotic weather balloon launchers spread in Alaska</title><fingerprint>fd543f75</fingerprint></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303289v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303289v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303289v1?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/303289</canonicalUrl><author><name>Dunphy, L.

Aims &lt;p&gt;Jumonji Domain-Containing 1A (JMJD1A) protein promotes demethylation of histones, especially at lysin-9 of di-methylated histone H3 (H3K9me2) or mono-methylated (H3K9me1). Increased levels of H3 histone methylation at lysin-9 (H3K9) is related to tumor suppressor gene silencing. &lt;i&gt;JMJD1A&lt;/i&gt; gene target Adrenomeduline (ADM) has shown to promote cell growth and tumorigenesis.

Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against complement protein C5, is considered to be the current standard of care for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. This study describes the generation and preclinical attributes of ALXN1210, a new long-acting anti-C5 mAb, obtained through select modifications to eculizumab to both largely abolish target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and increase recycling efficiency via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). To attenuate the effect of TMDD on plasma terminal half-life (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;), histidine substitutions were engineered into the complementarity-determining regions of eculizumab to enhance the dissociation rate of the mAb:C5 complex in the acidic early endosome relative to the slightly basic pH of blood. Antibody variants with optimal pH-dependent binding to C5 exhibited little to no TMDD in mice in the presence of human C5. To further enhance the efficiency of FcRn-mediated recycling of the antibody, two additional substitutions were introduced to increase affinity for human FcRn. These substitutions yielded an additional doubling of the t&lt;sub&gt;¬Ω&lt;/sub&gt; of surrogate anti-mouse C5 antibodies with reduced TMDD in transgenic mice expressing the human FcRn. In conclusion, ALXN1210 is a promising new therapeutic candidate currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66da:9f3b30f2</id><title>Design and preclinical characterization of ALXN1210: A novel anti-C5 antibody with extended duration of action</title><fingerprint>715cda6d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Douglas Sheridan, Zhao-Xue Yu, Yuchun Zhang, Rekha Patel, Fang Sun, Melissa A.

Background &lt;p&gt;The etiology of transient corneal haze in premature infants is not known and how it relates to clinical outcomes in premature infants is not clear.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To study associated factors of transient corneal haze in premature infants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a retrospective study of 261 premature infants from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening in the neonatal intensive care unit at a tertiary referral hospital. Characteristics of premature infants with and without corneal haze were analyzed by correlation tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regressions were used for statistical analyses. Associations between corneal haze and birth weight (BW), gestational age at birth (GA), central corneal thickness, intraocular pressure, and other systemic and ophthalmic data were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The incidence of corneal haze was 13.4%. Lower BW, lower GA, packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion, more days on oxygen, older maternal age, bronchopulmonary disease, and stage 3 ROP are associated with corneal haze. The severity of corneal haze decreased with infants‚Äô postmenstrual age. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that BW and maternal age are the most important predictors of corneal haze.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Low BW and older maternal age are the most important predictors of corneal haze in premature infants. Premature infants with corneal haze could carry more systemic and ocular morbidities. Hence they may require more clinical attention. Corneal haze is unlikely to hinder the treatment of ROP. However, it is possible that corneal haze could hinder the examination of ROP in some infants. If corneal haze does interfere with ROP screening, a closer, more conservative follow-up schedule with a senior ophthalmologist experienced in managing ROP is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde35:9f3b30f2</id><title>The characteristics of premature infants with transient corneal haze</title><fingerprint>934468ef</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Hung Lai, Hsiu-Lin Chen, San-Nan Yang, Shun-Jen Chang, Lea-Yea Chuang, Wen-Chuan Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Although associations between oral health and pneumonia have been reported in previous studies, particularly in the institutionalized elderly, few prospective studies have investigated the association between oral condition and pneumonia among community-dwelling people and whether the findings among inpatients or patients in nursing homes are applicable to the general population is still unclear. The oral bacteria propagated in the periodontal regions may drop into the lung and increase the risk of pneumonia. We, therefore, investigated the association of tooth loss with mortality from pneumonia in a cohort study of Japanese dentists. Members of the Japan Dental Association (JDA) participated in the LEMONADE (Longitudinal Evaluation of Multi-phasic, Odontological and Nutritional Associations in Dentists) Study. From 2001 to 2006, they completed a baseline questionnaire on lifestyle and health factors including the number of teeth lost (excluding third molars). We followed 19,775 participants (mean age ¬± standard deviation, 51.4 ¬± 11.7 years; 1,573 women [8.0%] and 18,202 men [92.0%]) for mortality from pneumonia (ICD-10, J12-J18). Mortality data were collected via the fraternal insurance program of the JDA. The hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, physical activity and diabetes history. During the median follow-up period of 9.5 years, we documented 68 deaths from pneumonia. Participants who were edentulous at baseline were at significantly increased risk of mortality from pneumonia. The multivariable-adjusted HRs were 2.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09‚Äì3.95) for the edentulous and 1.60 (95% CI, 0.83‚Äì3.10) for loss of 15‚Äì27 teeth relative to loss of 0‚Äì14 teeth (trend &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.026). The HR per one tooth loss was also significant; 1.031 (95% CI, 1.004‚Äì1.060). In conclusion, a large number of teeth lost may indicate an increased risk of mortality from pneumonia in community-dwelling populations.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793630:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Tooth loss and pneumonia mortality: A cohort study of Japanese dentists</title><fingerprint>a79ebb1b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shino Suma, Mariko Naito, Kenji Wakai, Toru Naito, Masaaki Kojima, Osami Umemura, Makoto Yokota, Nobuhiro Hanada, Takashi Kawamura&lt;/p&gt;

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) emphasises the role of biodiversity in delivering benefits essential for all people and, as a result, seeks to safeguard all life-forms. The indices that are used to measure progress towards international conservation and sustainability goals, however, focus solely on the ‚Äònative‚Äô component of biodiversity. A subset of non-native species can cause undesirable economic, social, or biological effects. But non-native species also contribute to regional biodiversity (species richness and biotic interactions) and ecosystem services. In some regions and cities, non-native species make up more than half of all species. Currently, the contributions of these species to biodiversity and ecosystem services are overlooked. Here, I argue that biodiversity and sustainability indices should include all species. This is not only consistent with definitions of biodiversity but also will promote the idea that long-term, sustainable, human well-being is intricately tied to benefits derived from nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-8DNjfEBZcQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162d4c15df7:4bb2d:a077e55f</id><title>Do non-native species contribute to biodiversity?</title><fingerprint>28438fed</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martin A.

Delivery of recombinant proteins to therapeutic cells is limited by a lack of efficient methods. This hinders the use of transcription factors or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) ribonucleoproteins to develop cell therapies. Here, we report a soluble peptide designed for the direct delivery of proteins to mammalian cells including human stem cells, hard-to-modify primary natural killer (NK) cells, and cancer cell models. This peptide is composed of a 6x histidine-rich domain fused to the endosomolytic peptide CM18 and the cell penetrating peptide PTD4.

Delivery of recombinant proteins to therapeutic cells is limited by a lack of efficient methods. This hinders the use of transcription factors or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) ribonucleoproteins to develop cell therapies. Here, we report a soluble peptide designed for the direct delivery of proteins to mammalian cells including human stem cells, hard-to-modify primary natural killer (NK) cells, and cancer cell models. This peptide is composed of a 6x histidine-rich domain fused to the endosomolytic peptide CM18 and the cell penetrating peptide PTD4. A less than two-minute co-incubation of 6His-CM18-PTD4 peptide with spCas9 and/or asCpf1 CRISPR ribonucleoproteins achieves robust gene editing. The same procedure, co-incubating with the transcription factor HoxB4, achieves transcriptional regulation. The broad applicability and flexibility of this DNA- and chemical-free method across different cell types, particularly hard-to-transfect cells, opens the way for a direct use of proteins for biomedical research and cell therapy manufacturing.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24901-2</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/j8F_yL41p1o/s41598-018-24901-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24901-2</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Edward K.

Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46‚Äì0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFŒ± therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance. Variant alleles were extremely rare in our population (MAF&amp;lt;0.025) except for R202Q (MAF = 0.27). None was associated with SpA diagnosis (p&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene SNPs are not associated with SpA in the North-East of Italy.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records‚Äîincluding SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)‚Äîof consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2‚Äì3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI. SWAN- and DWI-based mASPECTSs were calculated, and correlations between DWI-SWAN mismatches with final infarct lesions or clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 35 patients included in this study, we confirmed cardioembolic stroke in 26, atherothrombotic stroke in 4, and unknown stroke etiology in 5. Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient&apos;s age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization. Assessment of ischemic lesions from the venous side appears to be useful for considering the etiology and revascularization therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1eca:9f3b30f2</id><title>Assessment of veins in T2*-weighted MR angiography predicts infarct growth in hyperacute ischemic stroke</title><fingerprint>842f3c7b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susumu Yamaguchi, Nobutaka Horie, Minoru Morikawa, Yohei Tateishi, Takeshi Hiu, Yoichi Morofuji, Tsuyoshi Izumo, Kentaro Hayashi, Takayuki Matsuo&lt;/p&gt;

Individuals with low levels of education systematically have worse health than those with medium or high levels of education. Yet there are few examples of attempts to summarize the evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions targeting health-related behavior among individuals with low education levels, and a large part of the literature is descriptive rather than analytical. A rapid review was carried out to examine the impact of such interventions. Special attention was given to the relative impact of the interventions among individuals with low education levels and their potential to reduce health inequality. Of 1,365 articles initially identified, only 31 were deemed relevant for the review, and of those, nine met the inclusion and quality criteria. The comparability of included studies was limited due to differences in study design, sample characteristics, and definitions of exposure and outcome variables. Therefore, instead of performing a formal meta-analysis, an overall assessment of the available evidence was made and summarized into some general conclusions. We found no support for the notion that the methods used to reduce smoking decrease inequalities in health between educational groups. Evidence was also limited for decreasing inequality through interventions regarding dietary intake, physical activity and mental health. Only one study was found using an intervention designed to decrease socioeconomic inequalities by increasing the use of breast cancer screening. Thus, we concluded that there is a lack of support regarding this type of intervention as well. Therefore, the main conclusion is that solid evidence is lacking for interventions aimed at individual determinants of health and that more research is needed to fill this gap in knowledge.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae0:9f3b30f2</id><title>Reducing health inequalities with interventions targeting behavioral factors among individuals with low levels of education - A rapid review</title><fingerprint>2962fae8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Vilhelmsson, Per-Olof √ñstergren&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Camellia nitidissima&lt;/i&gt; Chi (CNC) is a valuable medicinal and edible plant in China. In this study, CNC flowers were extracted with 95% ethanol, then partitioned into dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol, and water fractions, with the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and other phytochemicals in CNC flowers investigated for the first time. Results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity and highest total phenolic content (TPC) compared with the other fractions. Furthermore, in the ethyl acetate fraction, the 50% effective concentrations (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and DPPH radical scavenging activities were 64.24 ¬± 1.80 and 78.80 ¬± 0.34 Œºg/mL, respectively, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was 801.49 ¬± 2.30 ŒºM FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 1,000 Œºg/mL. Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficients and principal component analyses (PCA) for the TPC and antioxidant capacity of the five fractions indicated that the phenolic compounds were the major antioxidant constituents in the flowers.

Determining and understanding drug target engagement is critical for drug discovery. This can be challenging within living cells as selective readouts are often unavailable. Here we describe a novel method for measuring target engagement in living cells based on the principle of altered protein thermal stabilization / destabilization in response to ligand binding. This assay (HCIF-CETSA) utilizes high content, high throughput single cell immunofluorescent detection to determine target protein levels following heating of adherent cells in a 96 well plate format. We have used target engagement of Chk1 by potent small molecule inhibitors to validate the assay. Target engagement measured by this method was subsequently compared to target engagement measured by two alternative methods (autophosphorylation and CETSA).

Massey&lt;/p&gt;
Determining and understanding drug target engagement is critical for drug discovery. This can be challenging within living cells as selective readouts are often unavailable. Here we describe a novel method for measuring target engagement in living cells based on the principle of altered protein thermal stabilization / destabilization in response to ligand binding. This assay (HCIF-CETSA) utilizes high content, high throughput single cell immunofluorescent detection to determine target protein levels following heating of adherent cells in a 96 well plate format. We have used target engagement of Chk1 by potent small molecule inhibitors to validate the assay. Target engagement measured by this method was subsequently compared to target engagement measured by two alternative methods (autophosphorylation and CETSA). The HCIF-CETSA method appeared robust and a good correlation in target engagement measured by this method and CETSA for the selective Chk1 inhibitor V158411 was observed. However, these EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were 23- and 12-fold greater than the autophosphorylation IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. The described method is therefore a valuable advance in the CETSA method allowing the high throughput determination of target engagement in adherent cells.</description></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00101</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00101/20180416/images/medium/cb-2018-00101n_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00101&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The results obtained in this study have proven that the plane‚Äêwave basis set first principles calculations under periodic conditions is suitable for accurate prediction of crystal structure and stability. ¬© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</link><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Huabin Liang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huabin Liang, Ruoheng Yang, Zhihua Liu, Min Li, Haitao Liu, Xia Jin&lt;/p&gt;

If you‚Äôve heard him speak on the topic of organic synthesis, you‚Äôve probably heard most of what‚Äôs in that piece, but it‚Äôs a good summary of his position. Picked up roughly where I left off last time, he has this to say about innovation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One measure of the health of a scientific field is its ability to generate new ideas (as opposed to extensions of already established themes), and to reinvent itself. A familiar idea in discussions of innovation is that it comes in different forms: for example, innovation can focus on new technology (where organic synthesis has tended to shine), or on new processes¬†(where the most innovative work has often been done by process‚Äêdevelopment groups in industry), or new business plans (for example, the decision by China to make low‚Äêcost capital available for production of silicon‚Äêbased solar cells ‚Äì a decision that has been enormously important in accelerating the implementation of solar energy). The question facing organic synthesis is not ‚Äúhas the need for new methods of syntheses disappeared?‚Äù but rather ‚ÄúWhat problems ‚Äì intellectual, empirical, or practical ‚Äì most require new ideas in synthesis?‚Äù Is the future for more of the familiar ‚Äì what Kuhn called ‚Äúordinary science‚Äù ‚Äì or for something more radical, more important, more different fundamentally? (More, perhaps, having the audacity of what Woodward, Eschenmoser, and others suggested and demonstrated 50‚ÄÖyears ago?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs an uncomfortable question, when you start to think about it. That‚Äôs not asking organic chemists what they can do, but what the most important and interesting questions are that they can contribute to. And it‚Äôs also asking, ‚ÄúOf the biggest and most important questions in general, which ones can organic synthesis help with?‚Äù Whitesides lists some of those in broad strokes (catalysis, materials science, synthetic biology, automation/mechanization of organic chemistry, etc.) and in more particular ones (molecular recognition, origin of life studies, sequence-specific polymers, new biocompatible materials, and more). It may or may not be a coincidence that what many people think of when they think of ‚Äúorganic synthesis‚Äù ‚Äì total synthesis of natural products ‚Äì does not impinge nearly as much on these topics as some of its practitioners might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the most important questions that natural products synthesis can provide a key role in helping to answer? One that I can think of is unraveling complex biochemical pathways where more simple chemical matter just doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to make things clear. I would adduce rapamycin and FK-506 as examples of this, and there are many others. Indeed, some of the larger pharmaceutical molecules are getting into ‚Äúnon-natural-product‚Äù zones of complexity and molecular weight (although, to be sure, they‚Äôre generally much easier to make, since we‚Äôve produced them (or their precursors) with that in mind. Modifications of the natural products themselves is another such field, and it‚Äôs not an easy one, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are worthy topics, and there are others. But at this point, I want to being in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b02266&quot;&gt;another recent article&lt;/a&gt;, from Phil Baran at Scripps, introducing a special collection of total organic synthesis papers. This introduction is written by someone who‚Äôs well acquainted with criticism of the field. Interestingly, he and Whitesides are in agreement on what some of the interesting problems are (automation being one example), but that agreement definitely doesn‚Äôt go all the way. That‚Äôs because Baran‚Äôs article, as mentioned, is deliberately written as a defense of total synthesis, and it reads at times like a response to a prosecutor‚Äôs opening statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with some of what Prof. Baran has to say as well. I think, for example, that he‚Äôs absolutely right when he says that the application of AI and automation to really complex molecules is still a long way off. We might disagree on just what a ‚Äúlong way‚Äù measures out to, but there‚Äôs no doubt that retrosynthetic planning of such molecules and their actual forward synthesis is a really significant challenge that only humans ‚Äì and pretty damned competent humans, at that ‚Äì are now able to meet. (Drug-sized molecules are another matter). Of course, Prof. Baran and I are in agreement about many other points as well, a big one (mentioned above) being the use of such complex molecules to work out biochemical pathways. There‚Äôs often no alternative, and there are several fields that would be in much worse shape if synthetic chemistry hadn‚Äôt evolved far enough to deal with such structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key place where I think Baran and Whitesides, though, do not really come to a meeting of the minds is in the question of ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Some of the responses given in Baran‚Äôs article ‚Äì total synthesis trains students well, industry likes to hire people who do it, it‚Äôs a solid way to prove compound structures, it‚Äôs beautiful in and of itself ‚Äì ¬†are the same justifications I was given when I was first working in the field in the mid-1980s. And it‚Äôs not that time has falsified all of these, but it may have made some of them a bit less compelling. It may seem odd to say it, but for some time I bought into this worldview completely, and even now I don‚Äôt completely reject it. But sometimes, I think it seems to the total synthesis community that you‚Äôre either for them or against them, and that apostasy is always a short, fatal, step away. The shortest and most fatal of those steps is wondering in general if total synthesis of natural products still pays its way, scientifically. Here‚Äôs Whitesides again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The trick will be to find classes of problems that return complex synthesis (Organic Synthesis, perhaps in an evolved and more expansive and ambitious form) to a central role in the future of the field, rather than having it become an extraordinary specialty or craft, admired but occupying an increasingly isolated place as the rest of synthesis moves on. The argument that complex synthesis, by itself, is beautiful is doubtless true, but also dangerous. Most societies have valued beautiful products of human imagination and skill, but paying to support the artists who produce them has been another matter entirely. And, unfortunately, the beauty of Organic Synthesis is not something that most non‚Äêsynthetic‚Äêchemists can understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technical expertise is not, by itself, enough to sustain a field (consider mechanical watchmaking or glass‚Äêblowing). To prosper, Organic Synthesis must also solve recognizable problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That exact argument for beauty is one of the ones made in Prof. Baran‚Äôs article, actually. It‚Äôs not his main point ‚Äì actually his main points and those of Prof. Whitesides might well end up being closer than you‚Äôd think ‚Äì but it does represent the sort of sticking point that keeps coming up between practioners of the field and those outside it. I‚Äôm outside it, and have been for many years. I can understand it and appreciate many of its qualities, but I‚Äôm not able ‚Äì unfortunately ‚Äì to tell people that its best days are yet to come. They might be. But they might not.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162d3ab165d:3280d7f:9f3b30f2</id><title>More Thoughts of George Whitesides ‚Äì And of Phil Baran</title><fingerprint>d7a7bd9e</fingerprint><description>The other day I wrote up some comments about a recent article from George Whitesides.

Studies disrupting the chemokine pathway CX3CL1 (fractalkine)/ CX3CR1 have shown decreased atherosclerosis in animal models but the techniques used to interrupt the pathway have not been easily translatable into human trials. DNA vaccination potentially overcomes the translational difficulties. We evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine, targeted to CX3CR1, on atherosclerosis in a murine model and examined possible mechanisms of action. DNA vaccination against CX3CR1, enhanced by dendritic cell targeting using DEC-205 single chain variable region fragment (scFv), was performed in 8 week old ApoE-/- mice, fed a normal chow diet. High levels of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies were induced in vaccinated mice. There were no apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine. Arterial vessels of 34 week old mice were examined histologically for atherosclerotic plaque size, macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell infiltration and lipid deposition. Vaccinated mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque in the brachiocephalic artery. There was less macrophage infiltration but no significant change to the macrophage phenotype in the plaques. There was less lipid deposition in the lesions, but there was no effect on smooth muscle cell migration. Targeted DNA vaccination to CX3CR1 was well tolerated, induced a strong immune response and resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesions with reduced macrophage infiltration.

SRP recognizes the ribosome synthesizing a signal sequence and delivers it to the SRP receptor (SR) on the ER membrane followed by the transfer of the signal sequence to the translocon. Here, we present the cryo‚Äìelectron microscopy structure of the mammalian translating ribosome in complex with SRP and SR in a conformation preceding signal sequence handover.

The psychometric properties of the ten-item Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K10) have been extensively explored in civilian populations. However, documentation of its psychometric properties in military populations is limited, and there is no universally accepted cut-off score on the K10 to distinguish clinical vs. sub-clinical levels of distress. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the K10 in Canadian Armed Forces personnel. Data on 6700 Regular Forces personnel were obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey. The internal consistency and factor structure of the K10 (range, 0‚Äì40) were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to select optimal cut-offs for the K10, using the presence/absence of any of four past-month disorders as the outcome (posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). Cronbach‚Äôs alpha (0.88) indicated a high level of internal consistency of the K10. Results from CFA indicated that a single-factor 10-item construct had an acceptable overall fit: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05; 90% confidence interval (CI):0.05‚Äì0.06, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.99, weighted root mean square residual (WRMR) = 2.06. K10 scores were strongly associated with both the presence and recency of all four measured disorders. The area under the ROC curve was 0.92, demonstrating excellent predictive value for past-30-day disorders. A K10 score of 10 or greater was optimal for screening purposes (sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 83%), while a score of 17 or greater (sensitivity = 53%; specificity = 97%) was optimal for prevalence estimation of clinically significant psychological distress, in that it resulted in equal numbers of false positives and false negatives. Our results suggest that K10 scale has satisfactory psychometric properties for use as a measure of non-specific psychological distress in the military population.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7b:fc1f8953</id><title>The psychometric properties of the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) in Canadian military personnel</title><fingerprint>c1e8930f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hugues Sampasa-Kanyinga, Mark A.

There is a marked comorbidity between alcohol abuse and eating disorders, especially in the young population. We have previously reported that bingeing on fat during adolescence increases the rewarding effects of ethanol (EtOH). The aim of the present work was to study if vulnerability to EtOH persists after cessation of binge eating. OF1 mice binged on fat (HFB: high-fat binge) during adolescence (PND 25‚Äì43) and were tested for 15 days after the last access to HFB (on PND 59) using the self-administration paradigm, the conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization to ethanol. Our results showed that after 15 days of cessation of fat ingestion, mice increased their consumption of ethanol and showed greater motivation to obtain ethanol. On the other hand, no effects were observed in the CPP, while an increased locomotor response to ethanol was detected. The present results confirm and extend our previous study demonstrating that the compulsive intake of fat induces long-lasting effects on the reward system that lead to an increased consumption of EtOH.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad281b:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Increased ethanol consumption after interruption of fat bingeing</title><fingerprint>9984bae5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

Background &lt;p&gt;In a study conducted in Bhopal district (a setting with facility for molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST)) located in central India in 2014‚Äì15, we found high levels of pre-diagnosis attrition among patients with presumptive multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)‚Äìmeaning TB patients who were eligible for DST, were not being tested.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the health care provider perspectives into barriers and suggested solutions for improving DST.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a descriptive qualitative study. One to one interviews (n = 10) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with experienced key informants involved in programmatic management of DR-TB were conducted in April 2017. Manual descriptive thematic analysis was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The key barriers reported were a) lack of or delay in identification of patients eligible for DST because of using treatment register as the source for identifying patients b) lack of assured specimen transport after patient identification and c) lack of tracking. Extra pulmonary TB patients were not getting identified as eligible for DST. Solutions suggested by the health care providers were i) generation of unique identifier at identification in designated microscopy center (DMC), immediate intimation of unique identifier to district and regular monitoring by senior TB laboratory and senior treatment supervisors of patients eligible for DST that were missed; ii) documentation of unique identifier at each step of cascade; iii) use of human carriers/couriers to transport specimen from DMCs especially in rural areas; and iv) routine entry of all presumptive extra-pulmonary TB specimen, as far as possible, in DMC laboratory register.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Lack of assured specimen transport and lack of accountability for tracking patient after identification and referral were the key barriers. The identification of patients eligible for DST among microbiologically confirmed TB at the time of diagnosis and among clinically confirmed TB at the time of treatment initiation is the key.

Background &lt;p&gt;In a study conducted in Bhopal district (a setting with facility for molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST)) located in central India in 2014‚Äì15, we found high levels of pre-diagnosis attrition among patients with presumptive multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)‚Äìmeaning TB patients who were eligible for DST, were not being tested.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the health care provider perspectives into barriers and suggested solutions for improving DST.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a descriptive qualitative study. One to one interviews (n = 10) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with experienced key informants involved in programmatic management of DR-TB were conducted in April 2017. Manual descriptive thematic analysis was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The key barriers reported were a) lack of or delay in identification of patients eligible for DST because of using treatment register as the source for identifying patients b) lack of assured specimen transport after patient identification and c) lack of tracking. Extra pulmonary TB patients were not getting identified as eligible for DST. Solutions suggested by the health care providers were i) generation of unique identifier at identification in designated microscopy center (DMC), immediate intimation of unique identifier to district and regular monitoring by senior TB laboratory and senior treatment supervisors of patients eligible for DST that were missed; ii) documentation of unique identifier at each step of cascade; iii) use of human carriers/couriers to transport specimen from DMCs especially in rural areas; and iv) routine entry of all presumptive extra-pulmonary TB specimen, as far as possible, in DMC laboratory register.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Lack of assured specimen transport and lack of accountability for tracking patient after identification and referral were the key barriers. The identification of patients eligible for DST among microbiologically confirmed TB at the time of diagnosis and among clinically confirmed TB at the time of treatment initiation is the key. Use of unique identifier at identification and its use to ensure cohort wise tracking has to be complemented with specimen transport support and prompt feedback to the DMC. The study has implications to improve detection of MDR-TB among diagnosed/notified TB patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4075.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4075.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4075.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/16.cover-source.jpg?itok=dseVEs2E</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>480</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4075</canonicalUrl><author><name>Yu Long Han, Pierre Ronceray, Guoqiang Xu, Andrea Malandrino, Roger D.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in human breast cancer and is a marker for poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Transplantation of p53 null mouse mammary epithelium into syngeneic wild-type mice leads to normal mammary gland development followed by spontaneous mammary tumors that recapitulate many of the phenotypic, molecular and genetic features of human breast cancer. Transient exposure of p53 null mice to the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen leads to sustained and robust protection against tumor development. However the mechanism underlying this anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that transient exposure to tamoxifen leads to a reduction in mammary ductal side-branching and epithelial cell proliferation after tamoxifen withdrawal. Global gene expression analysis showed that transient tamoxifen exposure leads to persistent changes in the expression of a subset of estrogen regulated gene signatures in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Among these was the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt;). We show that &lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt; is a novel tamoxifen regulated target gene which is upregulated in MECs after transient tamoxifen exposure and displays tumor suppressor activity in human breast cancer cells. Further, PTPN5 expression is strongly associated with good clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated human breast cancer patients suggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel biomarker of tamoxifen response in human breast cancer.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424a:9f3b30f2</id><title>Reprogramming of the estrogen responsive transcriptome contributes to tamoxifen-dependent protection against tumorigenesis in the p53 null mammary epithelial cells</title><fingerprint>33265d5b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Murugesan Palaniappan, David Edwards, Chad J.

Further, PTPN5 expression is strongly associated with good clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated human breast cancer patients suggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel biomarker of tamoxifen response in human breast cancer.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03685-z</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/DmqIwJZ-x1g/s41467-018-03685-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03685-z</originId><unread>True</unread><author><name>Igor Lehnherr</name></author><published>1522306800000</published><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03685-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>92</engagement><crawled>1522315353767</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03685-z/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3685_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>434</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width></visual><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The world‚Äôs largest High Arctic lake responds rapidly to climate warming&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world‚Äôs largest High Arctic lake responds rapidly to climate warming, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03685-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03685-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Arctic ecosystems are at threat due to the rapid nature of climate change and Arctic amplification.

Digital image processing is widely used in the non-destructive diagnosis of plant nutrition. Previous plant nitrogen diagnostic studies have mostly focused on characteristics of the rice canopy or leaves at some specific points in time, with the long sampling intervals unable to provide detailed and specific ‚Äúdynamic features.‚Äù According to plant growth mechanisms, the dynamic changing rate in leaf shape and color differ between different nitrogen supplements. Therefore, the objective of this study was to diagnose nitrogen stress levels by analyzing the dynamic characteristics of rice leaves. Scanning technology was implemented to collect rice leaf images every 3 days, with the characteristics of the leaves from different leaf positions extracted utilizing MATLAB. Newly developed shape characteristics such as etiolation area (EA) and etiolation degree (ED), in addition to shape (area, perimeter) and color characteristics (green, normalized red index, etc.), were used to quantify the process of leaf change. These characteristics allowed sensitive indices to be established for further model validation. Our results indicate that the changing rates in dynamic characteristics, in particular the shape characteristics of the first incomplete leaf (FIL) and the characteristics of the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; leaf (leaf color and etiolation indices), expressed obvious distinctions among different nitrogen treatments. Consequently, we achieved acceptable diagnostic accuracy (training accuracy 77.3%, validation accuracy 64.4%) by using the FIL at six days after leaf emergence, and the new shape characteristics developed in this article (ED and EA) also showed good performance in nitrogen diagnosis. Based on the aforementioned results, dynamic analysis is valuable not only in further studies but also in practice.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa8:34f43e70</id><title>Nitrogen diagnosis based on dynamic characteristics of rice leaf image</title><fingerprint>7bc6fc75</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanyuan Sun, Shaochun Zhu, Xuan Yang, Melanie Valerie Weston, Ke Wang, Zhangquan Shen, Hongwei Xu, Lisu Chen&lt;/p&gt;

This robustness could reflect a homeostatic neural control which could have been already present in the earliest nervous systems.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03910-1</link><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03910-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03910-1</originId><published>1522738800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522784608098</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 years ago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 &amp;amp;amp; 100 years ago, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03910-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03910-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 years ago</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1628d091f62:95ea4d9:34f43e70</id><title>50 &amp; 100 years ago</title><fingerprint>4e46fc79</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 years ago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 &amp;amp;amp; 100 years ago, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03910-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03910-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 years ago</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3722.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3722.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3722.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3722</canonicalUrl><author><name>Kotaro Kosuge, Ryutaro Tokutsu, Eunchul Kim, Seiji Akimoto, Makio Yokono, Yoshifumi Ueno, Jun Minagawa</name></author><published>1522774666000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522778515834</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Photosynthetic organisms are frequently exposed to light intensities that surpass the photosynthetic electron transport capacity.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1Œ≤ and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes. HFD mice showed increments in colonic MDA, IL-1Œ≤ and IL-6 levels, as well as a decrease in &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in both colonic and epididymal tissues. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in SP and iNOS expression in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice. In preparations from HFD mice, electrically evoked contractions upon NOS blockade or mediated by tachykininergic stimulation were enhanced. In HFD mice, Apigenin counteracted the increase in body and epididymal fat weight, as well as the alterations of metabolic indexes. Apigenin reduced also MDA, IL-1Œ≤ and IL-6 colonic levels as well as eosinophil infiltration, SP and iNOS expression, along with a normalization of electrically evoked tachykininergic and nitrergic contractions. In addition, apigenin normalized &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in epididymal fat tissues, but not in colonic specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions and implications &lt;p&gt;Apigenin prevents systemic metabolic alterations, counteracts enteric inflammation and normalizes colonic dysmotility associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd90:9f3b30f2</id><title>The flavonoid compound apigenin prevents colonic inflammation and motor dysfunctions associated with high fat diet-induced obesity</title><fingerprint>bd7e623b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Gentile, Matteo Fornai, Rocchina Colucci, Carolina Pellegrini, Erika Tirotta, Laura Benvenuti, Cristina Segnani, Chiara Ippolito, Emiliano Duranti, Agostino Virdis, Sara Carpi, Paola Nieri, Zolt√°n H.

Networks in nature rarely function in isolation but instead interact with one another with a form of a network of networks (NoN). A network of networks with interdependency between distinct networks contains instability of abrupt collapse related to the global rule of activation. As a remedy of the collapse instability, here we investigate a model of correlated NoN. We find that the collapse instability can be removed when hubs provide the majority of interconnections and interconnections are convergent between hubs. Thus, our study identifies a stable structure of correlated NoN against catastrophic failures. Our result further suggests a plausible way to enhance network robustness by manipulating connection patterns, along with other methods such as controlling the state of node based on a local rule.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccae:34f43e70</id><title>Correlated network of networks enhances robustness against catastrophic failures</title><fingerprint>abd3e7f7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byungjoon Min, Muhua Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Random fluctuations in the amount of cellular components like mRNA and protein molecules are inevitable due to the stochastic and discrete nature of biochemical reactions. If large enough, this so-called ‚Äúcellular noise‚Äù can lead to random transitions between the expression states of a multistable genetic circuit. That way, heterogeneity within isogenic populations is created. Our aim is to understand which dynamical features of a simple autoregulatory system determine its intrinsic noise level, and how they can be modified in order to regulate state-transitions. To that end, novel mathematical methods for the state-dependent characterization and prediction of noise in multistable systems are developed. First, we introduce the hybrid LNA, a modified version of the Linear Noise Approximation. It yields good predictions on variances of mRNA and protein fluctuations, even for reaction systems comprising low-copy-number components (e.g. mRNA) and highly nonlinear reaction rates. Furthermore, the temporal structure of fluctuations and the skewness of the protein distribution are characterized via state-dependent protein burst sizes and burst frequencies. Based on this mathematical framework, we develop graphical methods which support the intuitive design of regulatory circuits with a desired noise pattern. The methods are then used to predict how overall noise in the system can be adapted, and how state-specific noise modifications are possible that allow, e.g., the generation of unidirectional transitions. Our considerations are validated by stochastic simulations. This way, a design of genetic circuits is possible that takes population heterogeneity into account and is valuable in applications of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Moreover, natural phenomena like the bimodal development of genetic competence can be studied.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f8:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Characterization of noise in multistable genetic circuits reveals ways to modulate heterogeneity</title><fingerprint>2ebafd65</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Katharina Hortsch, Andreas Kremling&lt;/p&gt;

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection. NHBA cleavage may occur at different stages of the infection, and it likely has a different role depending on the environment the bacterium is interacting with.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f0:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen is targeted by the human alternative pathway C3-convertase</title><fingerprint>90dfc2a8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Di Fede, Massimiliano Biagini, Elena Cartocci, Carlo Parillo, Alessandra Greco, Manuele Martinelli, Sara Marchi, Alfredo Pezzicoli, Isabel Delany, Silvia Rossi Paccani&lt;/p&gt;

In medicine, diagnoses based on medical test results are probabilistic by nature. Unfortunately, cognitive illusions regarding the statistical meaning of test results are well documented among patients, medical students, and even physicians. There are two effective strategies that can foster insight into what is known as Bayesian reasoning situations: (1) translating the statistical information on the prevalence of a disease and the sensitivity and the false-alarm rate of a specific test for that disease from probabilities into natural frequencies, and (2) illustrating the statistical information with tree diagrams, for instance, or with other pictorial representation. So far, such strategies have only been empirically tested in combination for ‚Äú1-test cases‚Äù, where one binary hypothesis (‚Äúdisease‚Äù vs. ‚Äúno disease‚Äù) has to be diagnosed based on one binary test result (‚Äúpositive‚Äù vs. ‚Äúnegative‚Äù). However, in reality, often more than one medical test is conducted to derive a diagnosis. In two studies, we examined a total of 388 medical students from the University of Regensburg (Germany) with medical ‚Äú2-test scenarios‚Äù. Each student had to work on two problems: diagnosing breast cancer with mammography and sonography test results, and diagnosing HIV infection with the ELISA and Western Blot tests. In Study 1 (N = 190 participants), we systematically varied the presentation of statistical information (‚Äúonly textual information‚Äù vs. ‚Äúonly tree diagram‚Äù vs. ‚Äútext and tree diagram in combination‚Äù), whereas in Study 2 (N = 198 participants), we varied the kinds of tree diagrams (‚Äúcomplete tree‚Äù vs. ‚Äúhighlighted tree‚Äù vs. ‚Äúpruned tree‚Äù). All versions were implemented in probability format (including probability trees) and in natural frequency format (including frequency trees). We found that natural frequency trees, especially when the question-related branches were highlighted, improved performance, but that none of the corresponding probabilistic visualizations did.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f21:9f3b30f2</id><title>Visualizing the Bayesian 2-test case: The effect of tree diagrams on medical decision making</title><fingerprint>272c294d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karin Binder, Stefan Krauss, Georg Bruckmaier, J√∂rg Marienhagen&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1‚Äîtransient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, without and with NF-Œ∫B activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium. NF-Œ∫B-activation of BEC caused &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; expression of SUR1-TRPM4 channels. In NF-Œ∫B-activated BEC: (i) tPA caused opening of SUR1-TRPM4 channels in a plasmin-, PAR1-, TRPC3- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner; (ii) tPA caused PAR1-dependent secretion of MMP-9; (iii) tonic secretion of MMP-9 by activated BEC was not influenced by SUR1 inhibition; (iv) phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA or the PAR1-agonist, TFLLR, required functional SUR1-TRPM4 channels, with inhibition of SUR1 decreasing tPA-induced MMP-9 secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;tPA induces PAR1-mediated, SUR1-TRPM4-dependent, phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec9:9f3b30f2</id><title>SUR1-TRPM4 channel activation and phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA in brain endothelial cells</title><fingerprint>c656222e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Volodymyr Gerzanich, Min Seong Kwon, Seung Kyoon Woo, Alexander Ivanov, J.

The transfer of seaweeds from subtidal bottoms to nearby intertidal rocky shores is a common but often overlooked phenomenon. Freshly detached seaweeds often represent critical trophic subsidies for herbivores living in upper-shore rocky intertidal areas, such as the marine snail &lt;i&gt;Diloma nigerrima&lt;/i&gt;. This species relies on three species of seaweeds for food and displays feeding strategies to deal with a resource that is scarce and at times unpredictable. This study focused on the nutritional quality of freshly detached algae (&lt;i&gt;Durvillaea antarctica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lessonia spicata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lessonia trabeculata&lt;/i&gt;) and measured &lt;i&gt;Diloma nigerrima&lt;/i&gt;‚Äôs algal consumption rates in trials with and without choice. Absorption efficiency and growth of individual snails fed on each alga were also measured. &lt;i&gt;Durvillaea antarctica&lt;/i&gt; had the highest nutritional quality and was the most consumed algae in both single and multiple-choice trials. Absorption efficiency was also highest for &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;antarctica&lt;/i&gt; but growth rates of snails fed with this species were similar to those fed with the other algae. Combined, these results suggest that &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigerrima&lt;/i&gt; has the ability to discriminate among seaweeds based on their nutritional quality. A potential increase in oxygen uptake when &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigerrima&lt;/i&gt; is consuming the preferred food item is also proposed as a plausible hypothesis to explain the mismatch between snails‚Äô preference and growth rate.

Background &lt;p&gt;We have reported that WNT10A plays a critical role in the growth of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells, i.e.; wound healing/scarring. To ascertain the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; regulatory, central functions of WNT10A, we examined the net effects of WNT10A depletion using &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice (&lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚Äì/‚Äì&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We generated &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚Äì/‚Äì&lt;/sup&gt;mice, displaying a range of unique phenotypes of morpho/organogenetic failure, such as growth retardation, alopecia, kyphosis and infertility, and then focused on the functions of WNT10A in wound healing. We subjected C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) or &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚Äì/‚Äì&lt;/sup&gt;mice to skin ulcer formation.

To ascertain the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; regulatory, central functions of WNT10A, we examined the net effects of WNT10A depletion using &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice (&lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚Äì/‚Äì&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We generated &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚Äì/‚Äì&lt;/sup&gt;mice, displaying a range of unique phenotypes of morpho/organogenetic failure, such as growth retardation, alopecia, kyphosis and infertility, and then focused on the functions of WNT10A in wound healing. We subjected C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) or &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚Äì/‚Äì&lt;/sup&gt;mice to skin ulcer formation. The &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚Äì/‚Äì&lt;/sup&gt;mice had significantly larger injured areas and delayed wound healing, which were associated with (a) a smaller number of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and microvessels; and (b) more reduced expression and synthesis of collagen, compared with WT mice with intact WNT10A expression, especially in those with activated myofibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These observations indicate that WNT10A signaling can play a pivotal in vivo role in wound healing by regulating the expression and synthesis of collagen, as one of fibrogenic factors, at least in part, and critical &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; roles of WNT10A-mediated effective wound healing are extremely closely associated with collagen expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00142</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00142/20180326/images/medium/bi-2018-00142a_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00142&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine is an Œ±&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptor agonist that causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, and so may effectively enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, there is little evidence that phenylephrine augments HPV in clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes. The P-N group had the drug-infusion in the reverse order. The primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Secondary outcomes were mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure variation, perfusion index, and difference between bladder and skin temperature. Statistical analysis was performed using the student t-test, Fisher&apos;s exact test, and ANOVA for Cross-over design. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine patients were analyzed. Although phenylephrine infusion significantly increased mean arterial pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), arterial partial pressure of oxygen did not differ between the two timepoints (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.19).

Objective &lt;p&gt;Western music is based on intervals; thus, interval discrimination is important for distinguishing the character of melodies or tracking melodies in polyphonic music.

Human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3) proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the conversion of deoxycytidine (dC) to deoxyuridine (dU) in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis‚Äîfor example, A3G deaminates the third dC in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy using the protection of telomeres protein 1 (Pot1) which has nanomolar affinity for ssDNA, with which we captured an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We crystallized a non-preferred adenine in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G. The structure reveals a unique conformation of the catalytic site loops that sheds light onto how the enzyme scans substrate in the -1 pocket. Furthermore, our biochemistry and virology studies provide evidence that the nucleotide-binding pockets on A3G influence each other in selecting the preferred DNA substrate. Together, the results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1f:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Insights into DNA substrate selection by APOBEC3G from structural, biochemical, and functional studies</title><fingerprint>d1d1d7b7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samantha J.

Two data sources were used: 1) self-administered survey that included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to capture depression symptoms and 2) medical record review. Two primary outcomes were evaluated with log-binomial models and Fisher‚Äôs exact test: the relationship between depression symptoms and 1) HIV treatment group, and 2) HIV adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 564 participants, 9.9% reported symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder.

Plant expansins are proteins involved in cell wall loosening, plant growth, and development, as well as in response to plant diseases and other stresses. In this study, we identified 128 expansin coding sequences from the wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt;) genome. These sequences belong to 45 homoeologous copies of &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt;, including 26 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPAs&lt;/i&gt;, 15 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPBs&lt;/i&gt; and four &lt;i&gt;TaEXLAs&lt;/i&gt;. No &lt;i&gt;TaEXLB&lt;/i&gt; was identified. Gene expression and sub-expression profiles revealed that most of the &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; were expressed either only in root tissues or in multiple organs.

Plant expansins are proteins involved in cell wall loosening, plant growth, and development, as well as in response to plant diseases and other stresses. In this study, we identified 128 expansin coding sequences from the wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt;) genome. These sequences belong to 45 homoeologous copies of &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt;, including 26 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPAs&lt;/i&gt;, 15 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPBs&lt;/i&gt; and four &lt;i&gt;TaEXLAs&lt;/i&gt;. No &lt;i&gt;TaEXLB&lt;/i&gt; was identified. Gene expression and sub-expression profiles revealed that most of the &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; were expressed either only in root tissues or in multiple organs. Real-time qPCR analysis showed that many &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; were differentially expressed in four different tissues of the two wheat cultivars‚Äîthe cold-sensitive ‚ÄòChinese Spring (CS)‚Äô and the cold-tolerant ‚ÄòDongnongdongmai 1 (D1)‚Äô cultivars. Our results suggest that the differential expression of &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; could be related to low-temperature tolerance or sensitivity of different wheat cultivars. Our study expands our knowledge on wheat expansins and sheds new light on the functions of expansins in plant development and stress response.</description></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</link><updated>1523480400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Mary Kosuth</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><published>1523480400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mary Kosuth, Sherri A.

Plastic pollution has been well documented in natural environments, including the open waters and sediments within lakes and rivers, the open ocean and even the air, but less attention has been paid to synthetic polymers in human consumables. Since multiple toxicity studies indicate risks to human health when plastic particles are ingested, more needs to be known about the presence and abundance of anthropogenic particles in human foods and beverages. This study investigates the presence of anthropogenic particles in 159 samples of globally sourced tap water, 12 brands of Laurentian Great Lakes beer, and 12 brands of commercial sea salt. Of the tap water samples analyzed, 81% were found to contain anthropogenic particles. The majority of these particles were fibers (98.3%) between 0.1‚Äì5 mm in length. The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99% were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg. Based on consumer guidelines, our results indicate the average person ingests over 5,800 particles of synthetic debris from these three sources annually, with the largest contribution coming from tap water (88%).</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd81:9f3b30f2</id><title>Anthropogenic contamination of tap water, beer, and sea salt</title><fingerprint>c135152e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mary Kosuth, Sherri A.

The relative age effect is a well-researched phenomenon, however there is still a dearth of understanding in track and field and female sport. This study investigated the role of relative age on selection for international competition of Spanish age group athletes between 2006‚Äì2014. Six hundred and forty two athletes competed for Spain at U20 or U18 age group international competition (n = 359 males; 283 females) across 9 years. The birthdates of these athletes were compared against the population of registered athletes at that time (14,502 males; 10,096 females). The results highlighted the influential role of relative age on selection to these opportunities. In line with previous research, this effect was mediated by age and gender, with stronger effects for both males and younger athletes (U18). The data best supported the ‚Äòmaturation-selection‚Äô hypothesis as a mechanism for RAEs. These results highlight the need to carefully consider the role and need for international competitive opportunities at different age groups. A number of possible context relevant solutions are discussed, including correction adjustments techniques and competition structure within track and field.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb3:34f43e70</id><title>Relative age effects in international age group championships: A study of Spanish track and field athletes</title><fingerprint>aa2957d9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Javier Brazo-Sayavera, Mar√≠a Asunci√≥n Mart√≠nez-Valencia, Lisa M√ºller, Georgios Andronikos, Russell J.

Autophagy plays a crucial role in health and disease, regulating central cellular processes such as adaptive stress responses, differentiation, tissue development, and homeostasis. However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti‚Äìhair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VVncDRle7Ww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1626db778eb:4248d4:bdf8aaf1</id><title>Autophagy is essential for maintaining the growth of a human (mini-)organ: Evidence from scalp hair follicle organ culture</title><fingerprint>e04b4211</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Parodi, Jonathan A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) impair the physical and mental status. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive ability of several cardiovascular biomarkers for identifying the incidence of disability as future recipients of public long-term care (LTC) service.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The subjects of this study were community-dwelling elderly individuals ‚â• 65 years of age without a history of CVD (n = 5,755; mean age, 71 years). The endpoint of this study was official certification as a recipient of LTC. The cohort was divided into quartiles (Qs) based on the levels of three CVD biomarkers: the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), plasma B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (BNP), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (hsCRP). A time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the multi-adjusted relative hazard ratios (HRs) for incident LTC among the quartiles of each biomarker.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the follow-up (mean 5.6 years), 710 subjects were authorized as recipients of LTC. The HR was only significantly increased in the higher Qs of UACR (Q3, p &amp;lt; 0.01; Q4, p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, other biomarkers were not significantly associated with the endpoint. The risk predictive performance for the incidence of LTC as evaluated by an essential model (i.e. age- and sex-adjusted) was significantly improved by incorporating the UACR (net reclassification improvement = 0.084, p &amp;lt; 0.01; integrated discrimination improvement = 0.0018, p &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that an increased UACR is useful for predicting physical and cognitive dysfunction in an elderly general population.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4253:9f3b30f2</id><title>The urine albumin-creatinine ratio is a predictor for incident long-term care in a general population</title><fingerprint>e7c5a7d5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shuko Takahashi, Fumitaka Tanaka, Yuki Yonekura, Kozo Tanno, Masaki Ohsawa, Kiyomi Sakata, Makoto Koshiyama, Akira Okayama, Motoyuki Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PKWzqyJ_2Tk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d4ba762b:4bed5d:bdf8aaf1</id><title>A computational model of shared fine-scale structure in the human connectome</title><fingerprint>3d9ec6e7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Globally, the number of dengue cases has been on the increase since 1990 and this trend has also been found in Brazil and its most populated city‚ÄîS√£o Paulo. Surveillance systems based on predictions allow for timely decision making processes, and in turn, timely and efficient interventions to reduce the burden of the disease. We conducted a comparative study of dengue predictions in S√£o Paulo city to test the performance of trained seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, generalized additive models and artificial neural networks. We also used a na√Øve model as a benchmark. A generalized additive model with lags of the number of cases and meteorological variables had the best performance, predicted epidemics of unprecedented magnitude and its performance was 3.16 times higher than the benchmark and 1.47 higher that the next best performing model. The predictive models captured the seasonal patterns but differed in their capacity to anticipate large epidemics and all outperformed the benchmark. In addition to be able to predict epidemics of unprecedented magnitude, the best model had computational advantages, since its training and tuning was straightforward and required seconds or at most few minutes. These are desired characteristics to provide timely results for decision makers. However, it should be noted that predictions are made just one month ahead and this is a limitation that future studies could try to reduce.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7691f:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Dengue forecasting in S√£o Paulo city with generalized additive models, artificial neural networks and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models</title><fingerprint>3294b76</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Oswaldo Santos Baquero, Lidia Maria Reis Santana, Francisco Chiaravalloti-Neto&lt;/p&gt;

This allows to obtain complete transcripts, which offers an unprecedented vision of the cellular transcriptome. However the literature is lacking tools to cluster such data de novo, in particular for Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads, because of the inherent high error rate compared to short reads. Our goal is to process reads from whole transcriptome sequencing data accurately and without a reference genome in order to reliably group reads coming from the same gene. This de novo approach is therefore particularly suitable for non-model species, but can also serve as a useful pre-processing step to improve read mapping. Our contribution is both to propose a new algorithm adapted to clustering of reads by gene and a practical and free access tool that permits to scale the complete processing of eukaryotic transcriptomes.

This allows to obtain complete transcripts, which offers an unprecedented vision of the cellular transcriptome. However the literature is lacking tools to cluster such data de novo, in particular for Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads, because of the inherent high error rate compared to short reads. Our goal is to process reads from whole transcriptome sequencing data accurately and without a reference genome in order to reliably group reads coming from the same gene. This de novo approach is therefore particularly suitable for non-model species, but can also serve as a useful pre-processing step to improve read mapping. Our contribution is both to propose a new algorithm adapted to clustering of reads by gene and a practical and free access tool that permits to scale the complete processing of eukaryotic transcriptomes. We sequenced a mouse RNA sample using the MinION device, this dataset is used to compare our solution to other algorithms used in the context of biological clustering. We demonstrate its is better-suited for transcriptomics long reads. When a reference is available thus mapping possible, we show that it stands as an alternative method that predicts complementary clusters.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03954-3</link><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03954-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03954-3/d41586-018-03954-3_15568976.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03954-3</originId><published>1522220400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>6</engagement><crawled>1522247805212</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communications breakdown puts resistant cancer at risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communications breakdown puts resistant cancer at risk, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03954-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03954-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cell-signalling blockade makes breast tumours vulnerable to drug treatment.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1626d0a291c:6b523d0:9f3b30f2</id><title>Communications breakdown puts resistant cancer at risk</title><fingerprint>b6c20883</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communications breakdown puts resistant cancer at risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communications breakdown puts resistant cancer at risk, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03954-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03954-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cell-signalling blockade makes breast tumours vulnerable to drug treatment.</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4194.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4194.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4194.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/16.cover-source.jpg?itok=dseVEs2E</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>480</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4194</canonicalUrl><author><name>William Gearty, Craig R.

Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Evidence suggests the microclimate of the classroom is an important factor influencing female course grades and interest, which encourages retention of women in STEM fields. Here, we test whether the gender composition of small (8‚Äì9 person) learning groups impacts course performance, sense of social belonging, and intragroup peer evaluations of intellectual contributions. Across two undergraduate active learning courses in introductory biology, we manipulated the classroom microclimate by varying the gender ratios of learning groups, ranging from 0% female to 100% female. We found that as the percent of women in groups increased, so did overall course performance for all students, regardless of gender. Additionally, women assigned higher peer- evaluations in groups with more women than groups with less women. Our work demonstrates an added benefit of the retention of women in STEM: increased performance for all, and positive peer perceptions for women.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f59:34f43e70</id><title>Small group gender ratios impact biology class performance and peer evaluations</title><fingerprint>bb7961bc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lauren L.

Methods &lt;p&gt;Twenty healthy subjects (10 males, age 28¬±5 years [mean ¬± SD]) lay supine, awake, with the head in a neutral position. Ventilation was monitored with inductance bands. Real-time B-mode ultrasound movies were analysed. We measured genioglossus motion (i) during spontaneous breathing, voluntary targeted breathing (normal tidal volume Vt), and voluntary hyperpnoea (at 1.5Vt and 2 Vt); (ii) during inspiratory flow resistive loading; (iii) with changes in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Average peak inspiratory displacement of the infero-posterior region of genioglossus was 0.89¬±0.56 mm; 1.02¬±0.88 mm; 1.27¬±0.70 mm respectively for voluntary Vt, and during voluntary hyperpnoea at 1.5Vt and 2Vt. A change in genioglossus motion was observed with increased Vt. During increasing inspiratory resistive loading, the genioglossus displaced less anteriorly (p = 0.005) but more inferiorly (p = 0.027). When lung volume was altered, no significant changes in genioglossus movement were observed (p = 0.115).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In healthy subjects, we observed non-uniform heterogeneous inspiratory motion within the inferoposterior part of genioglossus during spontaneous quiet breathing with mean peak displacement between 0.5‚Äì2 mm, with more displacement in the posterior region than the anterior. This regional heterogeneity disappeared during voluntary targeted breathing. This may be due to different neural drive to genioglossus during voluntary breathing. During inspiratory resistive loading, the observed genioglossus motion may serve to maintain upper airway patency by balancing intraluminal negative pressure with positive pressure generated by upper airway dilatory muscles. In contrast, changes in EELV were not accompanied by major changes in genioglossus motion.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae9:9f3b30f2</id><title>Influence of respiratory mechanics and drive on genioglossus movement under ultrasound imaging</title><fingerprint>c5e7695f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin C.

Background &lt;p&gt;MRI is the optimal method for sensitive detection of tumour tissue and pre-operative staging in oral cancer. When jawbone resections are necessary, the current standard of care for oral tumour surgery in our hospital is 3D virtual planning from CT data. 3D printed jawbone cutting guides are designed from the CT data. The tumour margins are difficult to visualise on CT, whereas they are clearly visible on MRI scans. The aim of this study was to change the conventional CT-based workflow by developing a method for 3D MRI-based lower jaw models. The MRI-based visualisation of the tumour aids in planning bone resection margins.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and findings &lt;p&gt;A workflow for MRI-based 3D surgical planning with bone cutting guides was developed using a four-step approach. Key MRI parameters were defined (phase 1), followed by an application of selected Black Bone MRI sequences on healthy volunteers (phase 2). Three Black Bone MRI sequences were chosen for phase 3: standard, fat saturated, and an out of phase sequence. These protocols were validated by applying them on patients (n = 10) and comparison to corresponding CT data. The mean deviation values between the MRI- and the CT-based models were 0.63, 0.59 and 0.80 mm for the three evaluated Black Bone MRI sequences. Phase 4 entailed examination of the clinical value during surgery, using excellently fitting printed bone cutting guides designed from MRI-based lower jaw models, in two patients with oral cancer. The mean deviation of the resection planes was 2.3 mm, 3.8 mm for the fibula segments, and the mean axis deviation was the fibula segments of 1.9¬∞.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study offers a method for 3D virtual resection planning and surgery using cutting guides based solely on MRI imaging. Therefore, no additional CT data are required for 3D virtual planning in oral cancer surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e800:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Optimisation of three-dimensional lower jaw resection margin planning using a novel Black Bone magnetic resonance imaging protocol</title><fingerprint>d8f94fdc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Astrid M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Swimming in fecally-contaminated waterbodies can result in gastrointestinal infections. However, the pathogenic microorganisms responsible are not well understood because sporadic cases of illness are not reported completely, exposure information is often not collected, and epidemiology studies rely on self-reported symptoms. Noroviruses are considered a likely cause because they are found in high densities in sewage, resistant to wastewater treatment and survive in the environment. In this study, saliva samples were collected from subjects at a beach in Puerto Rico and tested for evidence of norovirus-specific IgG responses as an indicator of incident norovirus infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Saliva samples were collected from 1298 participants using an oral swab. Samples were collected on the day of the beach visit (S1); after 10‚Äì12 days (S2); and after three weeks (S3). Saliva was tested for IgG responses to GI.1 and GII.4 noroviruses using a microsphere based multiplex salivary immunoassay. Immunoconversion was defined as a four-fold increase in median fluorescence intensity (MFI) from S1 to S2 with the S3 sample at least three times above the S1 MFI.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-four subjects (2.6%) immunoconverted to GI.1 or GII.4 norovirus. Swimmers who immersed their head in water had a higher rate of immunoconversion (3.4%), compared to either non-swimmers (0.0%, p = 0.003) or waders and non-swimmers combined (0.4%, Odds Ratio: 5.07, 95% Confidence Interval:1.48‚Äì17.00). Immunoconversion was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study to demonstrate an association between swimming at a beach impacted by fecal contamination and asymptomatic norovirus infection.

Neuronal information processing is regulated by fast and localized fluctuations of brain states. Brain states reliably switch between distinct spatiotemporal signatures at a network scale even though they are composed of heterogeneous and variable rhythms at a cellular scale. We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/12Pj_Yzaong&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392bd:a077e55f</id><title>Switchable slow cellular conductances determine robustness and tunability of network states</title><fingerprint>f8812915</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Drion, Julie Dethier, Alessio Franci, Rodolphe Sepulchre&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is increasingly being used to treat rapidly progressing or severe cardiogenic shock. However, it has been repeatedly shown that increased afterload associated with ECLS significantly diminishes left ventricular (LV) performance. The objective of the present study was to compare LV function and coronary flow during standard continuous-flow ECLS support and electrocardiogram (ECG)-synchronized pulsatile ECLS flow in a porcine model of cardiogenic shock.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixteen female swine (mean body weight 45 kg) underwent ECLS implantation under general anesthesia and artificial ventilation. Subsequently, acute cardiogenic shock, with documented signs of tissue hypoperfusion, was induced by initiating global myocardial hypoxia. Hemodynamic cardiac performance variables and coronary flow were then measured at different rates of continuous or pulsatile ECLS flow (ranging from 1 L/min to 4 L/min) using arterial and venous catheters, a pulmonary artery catheter, an LV pressure-volume loop catheter, and a Doppler coronary guide-wire.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Myocardial hypoxia resulted in declines in mean cardiac output to 1.7¬±0.7 L/min, systolic blood pressure to 64¬±22 mmHg, and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) to 22¬±7%. Synchronized pulsatile flow was associated with a significant reduction in LV end-systolic volume by 6.2 mL (6.7%), an increase in LV stroke volume by 5.0 mL (17.4%), higher LVEF by 4.5% (18.8% relative), cardiac output by 0.37 L/min (17.1%), and mean arterial pressure by 3.0 mmHg (5.5%) when compared with continuous ECLS flow at all ECLS flow rates (P&amp;lt;0.05). At selected ECLS flow rates, pulsatile flow also reduced LV end-diastolic pressure, end-diastolic volume, and systolic pressure. ECG-synchronized pulsatile flow was also associated with significantly increased (7% to 22%) coronary flow at all ECLS flow rates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ECG-synchronized pulsatile ECLS flow preserved LV function and coronary flow compared with standard continuous-flow ECLS in a porcine model of cardiogenic shock.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fad:34f43e70</id><title>Electrocardiogram-synchronized pulsatile extracorporeal life support preserves left ventricular function and coronary flow in a porcine model of cardiogenic shock</title><fingerprint>5bd68969</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Petr Ostadal, Mikulas Mlcek, Holger Gorhan, Ivo Simundic, Svitlana Strunina, Matej Hrachovina, Andreas Kr√ºger, Dagmar Vondrakova, Marek Janotka, Pavel Hala, Martin Mates, Martin Ostadal, James C.

Synchronized pulsatile flow was associated with a significant reduction in LV end-systolic volume by 6.2 mL (6.7%), an increase in LV stroke volume by 5.0 mL (17.4%), higher LVEF by 4.5% (18.8% relative), cardiac output by 0.37 L/min (17.1%), and mean arterial pressure by 3.0 mmHg (5.5%) when compared with continuous ECLS flow at all ECLS flow rates (P&amp;lt;0.05). At selected ECLS flow rates, pulsatile flow also reduced LV end-diastolic pressure, end-diastolic volume, and systolic pressure. ECG-synchronized pulsatile flow was also associated with significantly increased (7% to 22%) coronary flow at all ECLS flow rates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ECG-synchronized pulsatile ECLS flow preserved LV function and coronary flow compared with standard continuous-flow ECLS in a porcine model of cardiogenic shock.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/eaan4146?rss=1</link><keywords><item>Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, Online Only</item></keywords><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/eaan4146?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/eaan4146?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/eaan4146.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Weidberg, H., Amon, A.</name></author><published>1523554636000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial functions are essential for cell viability and rely on protein import into the organelle.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease.

Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1¬±8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days. Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; &amp;lt;15 [reference category], 15-&amp;lt;30, ‚â•30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.30 (95%CI = 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.71 (-1.08; -0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR&lt;sub&gt;‚â•30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR&lt;sub&gt;‚â•30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f8:34f43e70</id><title>Amount and pattern of physical activity and sedentary behavior are associated with kidney function and kidney damage: The Maastricht Study</title><fingerprint>76a5e3f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Remy J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. This warrants a search for risk factors of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1¬±8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days.

Based on extensive Langevin Dynamics simulations we investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of magnetic rods with a peapod-like morphology, i.e, rods consisting of aligned single dipolar beads. Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found. For the same density, the system exhibits different aggregation states for different misalignment. We also study the stability of the percolated structures with respect to temperature, which is found to be affected by the microstructure of the assembly of rods.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715296:9aea0a7d</id><title>Self-assembly and clustering of magnetic peapod-like rods with tunable directional interaction</title><fingerprint>1b624c1d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge L.

Milk oligosaccharides (OS) are a key factor that influences the infant gut microbial composition, and their importance in promoting healthy infant development and disease prevention is becoming increasingly apparent. Investigating the structures, properties, and sources of these compounds requires a host of complementary analytical techniques. Relative compound quantification by mass spectral analysis of isobarically labeled samples is a relatively new technique that has been used mainly in the proteomics field. Glycomics applications have so far focused on analysis of protein-linked glycans, while analysis of free milk OS has previously been conducted only on analytical standards. In this paper, we extend the use of isobaric glycan tags to the analysis of bovine milk OS by presenting a method for separation of labeled OS on a porous graphitized carbon liquid chromatographic column with subsequent analysis by quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Abundances for 15 OS extracted from mature bovine milk were measured, with replicate injections providing coefficients of variation below 15% for most OS. Isobaric labeling improved ionization efficiency for low-abundance, high-molecular weight fucosylated OS, which are known to exist in bovine milk but have been only sporadically reported in the literature. We compared the abundances of four fucosylated OS in milk from Holstein and Jersey cattle and found that three of the compounds were more abundant in Jersey milk, which is in general agreement with a previous study. This novel method represents an advancement in our ability to characterize milk OS and provides the advantages associated with isobaric labeling, including reduced instrumental analysis time and increased analyte ionization efficiency. This improved ability to measure differences in bioactive OS abundances in large datasets will facilitate exploration of OS from all food sources for the purpose of developing health-guiding products for infants, immune-compromised elderly, and the population at large.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae76:fc1f8953</id><title>Multiplexed bovine milk oligosaccharide analysis with aminoxy tandem mass tags</title><fingerprint>293be10c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Randall C.

Radiation-induced lung damage is an important treatment-related toxicity after lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). After implementing a tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co magnetic-resonance image guided system, ViewRay&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, we compared the associated early radiological lung density changes to those associated with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Eight patients treated with the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system were matched 1:1 with patients treated with LINAC. Prescription doses were 52 Gy or 60 Gy in four fractions, and lung dose-volumetric parameters were calculated from each planning system. The first two follow-up computed tomography (CT) were co-registered with the planning CT through deformable registration software, and lung density was measured by isodose levels. Tumor size was matched between the two groups, but the planning target volume of LINAC was larger than that of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036). With regard to clinically relevant dose-volumetric parameters in the lungs, the ipsilateral lung mean dose, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10Gy&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;20Gy&lt;/sub&gt; were significantly poorer in tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co plans compared to LINAC plans (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, 0.036, and 0.017, respectively). Increased lung density was not observed in the first follow-up scan compared to the planning scan. A significant change of lung density was shown in the second follow-up scan and there was no meaningful difference between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for all dose regions.

Radiation-induced lung damage is an important treatment-related toxicity after lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). After implementing a tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co magnetic-resonance image guided system, ViewRay&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, we compared the associated early radiological lung density changes to those associated with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Eight patients treated with the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system were matched 1:1 with patients treated with LINAC. Prescription doses were 52 Gy or 60 Gy in four fractions, and lung dose-volumetric parameters were calculated from each planning system. The first two follow-up computed tomography (CT) were co-registered with the planning CT through deformable registration software, and lung density was measured by isodose levels. Tumor size was matched between the two groups, but the planning target volume of LINAC was larger than that of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036). With regard to clinically relevant dose-volumetric parameters in the lungs, the ipsilateral lung mean dose, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10Gy&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;20Gy&lt;/sub&gt; were significantly poorer in tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co plans compared to LINAC plans (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, 0.036, and 0.017, respectively). Increased lung density was not observed in the first follow-up scan compared to the planning scan. A significant change of lung density was shown in the second follow-up scan and there was no meaningful difference between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for all dose regions. In addition, no patient developed clinical radiation pneumonitis until the second follow-up scan. Therefore, there was no significant difference in the early radiological lung damage between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for lung SABR despite of the inferior plan quality of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system compared to that of LINAC. Further studies with a longer follow-up period are needed to confirm our findings.</description></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4081.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>2.0</engagementRate><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4081.short?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4081.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/17/E4081/F2.medium.gif</url><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>307</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4081</canonicalUrl><author><name>Andrew T.

Bittersweet (&lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&lt;/i&gt;) is a native Old World member of the nightshade family. This European diploid species can be found from marshlands to high mountainous regions and it is a common weed that serves as an alternative host and source of resistance genes against plant pathogens such as late blight (&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt;). We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of bittersweet, which is 155,580 bp in length and it is characterized by a typical quadripartite structure composed of a large (85,901 bp) and small (18,449 bp) single-copy region interspersed by two identical inverted repeats (25,615 bp). It consists of 112 unique genes from which 81 are protein-coding, 27 tRNA and four rRNA genes. All bittersweet plastid genes including non-functional ones and even intergenic spacer regions are transcribed in primary plastid transcripts covering 95.22% of the genome. These are later substantially edited in a post-transcriptional phase to activate gene functions. By comparing the bittersweet plastid genome with all available Solanaceae sequences we found that gene content and synteny are highly conserved across the family. During genome comparison we have identified several annotation errors, which we have corrected in a manual curation process then we have identified the major plastid genome structural changes in Solanaceae. Interpreted in a phylogenetic context they seem to provide additional support for larger clades. The plastid genome sequence of bittersweet could help to benchmark Solanaceae plastid genome annotations and could be used as a reference for further studies. Such reliable annotations are important for gene diversity calculations, synteny map constructions and assigning partitions for phylogenetic analysis with de novo sequenced plastomes of Solanaceae.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67ac:91749e5b</id><title>The chloroplast genome sequence of bittersweet (&amp;lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&amp;lt;/i&gt;): Plastid genome structure evolution in Solanaceae</title><fingerprint>aa621f38</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Amiryousefi, Jaakko Hyv√∂nen, P√©ter Poczai&lt;/p&gt;

The authors are going over a number of areas where medicinal chemistry could make use of more advanced synthetic techniques, and they‚Äôre good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;From an industry perspective, the most common challenge for any new synthetic method is its level of tolerance to the polar functional groups and nitrogen heteroatoms found in biologically active molecules.&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù Yes indeed. That‚Äôs what I look at when I see a neat new transformation in the literature ‚Äì what did it work on? Basic amines OK? Tertiary or secondary? Secondary amides tolerated? Carboxylic acids? Free OH groups? I‚Äôm disappointed sometimes when I find that a reaction can‚Äôt tolerate these, but I‚Äôm glad that the papers involved at least went to the trouble of finding the limits to their chemistry. Far worse than that is a paper that tiptoes around the issues of chemical compatibility, leaving you to find out for yourself ‚Äì if you‚Äôre so inclined, and often one is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area identified is late-stage functionalization, C-H bond activation, etc. Those reactions are always welcome, for sure. Chemical diversity is one of the names of the game that we play, and anything that allows us to get more of it quickly and reliably is good news. Blending with the above, the more complex and functionalized the molecules that can be used as substrates for such chemistry, the better. We‚Äôll take fluorination, hydroxylation, amination, addition of methoxy, trifluoromethyl, what have you. It‚Äôs great to be able to predict where the functionalization will happen, of course, but there‚Äôs value in things that just sort of go in and mess with structures, too: new molecules! After all, that‚Äôs what the liver enzymes do to our drugs; we‚Äôre used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also calls for new ways to synthesize and functionalize small heterocyclic rings, new metal-catalyzed coupling reactions (and new C-C bond-forming reactions in general), more biomolecule-compatible reactions, and more. It also goes briefly into machine-assisted synthesis and software-assisted retrosynthesis, but the bulk of the paper is on synthetic methods, and I can only cheer on their suggestions. These are all potential areas for academic-industrial collaboration to generate new chemistry, because everyone benefits from success in these areas (indeed, some of this collaboration goes on already for just these reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I enjoyed this paper very much, but it starts off with a claim that‚Äôs worth arguing about: ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects&lt;/em&gt;‚Äú. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on where you‚Äôre standing. All the synthetic limitations described above are real, and they keep us from being able to make a lot of molecules that we‚Äôd otherwise be cranking out. But (and this is a big point) it‚Äôs rarely the case that we medicinal chemists identify a tricky new structure that absolutely has to be made. That sounds odd, but it comes down to our predictive powers, which aren‚Äôt so great. We don‚Äôt generally draw some wild compound up on the hood sash and say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one, folks: find a way to make it or die trying‚Äù. We never know which is the one, so in the absence of knowing, we make the things that we can make in the ways that we can make them, and honestly, much of the time, we can manage to come up with something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, though, things like the ability to make more polar compounds reliably and quickly would probably lead to better and more structurally diverse drug candidates and screening compounds, not to mention better starting points for projects in general. We just don‚Äôt know which ones.¬†The main examples of specific compounds I can think of are metabolites or potential metabolites, where the liver has made some new polar compound out of an existing drug candidate, and we need to make the new compound(s) for testing. Those can be tough, and sometimes the only way is to grind out small quantities by exposing the drug to liver tissue itself (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for times we can‚Äôt come up with something, I would like to believe that far more diverse and interesting sets of compounds, millions of them, would allow for real hits to be found against target classes that we currently have trouble attacking. But that remains to be proven, if it ever can be. Chemical space is so large that you can always say ‚ÄúWell, your compound set still wasn‚Äôt big enough ‚Äì the good ones are still out there‚Äù, and there‚Äôs no way to say that‚Äôs wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the real killers in drug discovery stem from ‚Äì to put it mildly ‚Äì our incomplete understanding of biology. It‚Äôs Phase II and Phase III failures that hammer us, and those happen because we don‚Äôt understand our desirable (and undesirable) mechanisms of action enough, leading to failures in efficacy and safety. Even worse, they come after a big pile of money has been spent. Compared to these problems, generating chemical matter is not as big a concern. We already generate enough chemical matter to send all sorts of stuff into the clinic, where 80 to 90% of it dies for other reasons entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic chemistry is, of course, crucial to making small-molecule drugs, and you‚Äôd think that would be enough. But as a chemist, I wish that organic synthesis were more relevant to these deep problems. But in the big picture, it isn‚Äôt quite so. Chemical biology, as a field, is an attempt to make that happen, but How to Make will never be able to answer questions of What to Make and Why.&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we show that, in human cells, cohesin loading onto chromosomes during early S phase requires the replicative helicase MCM2-7 and the kinase DDK. Cohesin and its loader SCC2/4 (NIPBL/MAU2 in humans) associate with DDK and phosphorylated MCM2-7. This binding does not require MCM2-7 activation by CDC45 and GINS, but its persistence on activated MCM2-7 requires fork-stabilizing replisome components. Inactivation of these replisome components impairs cohesin loading and causes interphase cohesion defects. Interfering with Okazaki fragment processing and nucleosome assembly does not impact cohesion. Therefore, MCM2-7-coupled cohesin loading promotes cohesion establishment, which occurs without Okazaki fragment maturation. We propose that the cohesin-loader complex bound to MCM2-7 is mobilized upon helicase activation, transiently held by the replisome, and deposited behind the replication fork to encircle sister chromatids and establish cohesion.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33920</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33920</originId><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33920</canonicalUrl><author><name>hongtao.yu@utsouthwestern.edu (Chao Xing)</name></author><published>1522713600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1522756983968</crawled><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1628b639ca0:9220dfa:7d6c1c1c</id><title>MCM2-7-dependent cohesin loading during S phase promotes sister-chromatid cohesion</title><fingerprint>b53da422</fingerprint><description>DNA replication transforms cohesin rings dynamically associated with chromatin into the cohesive form to establish sister-chromatid cohesion.

Background &lt;p&gt;This is the first report to characterize the prevalence and genovar distribution of genital chlamydial infections among random heterosexual patients in the multi-ethnic Saratov Region, located in Southeast Russia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixty-one clinical samples (cervical or urethral swabs) collected from a random cohort of 856 patients (7.1%) were &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT) positive in commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and duplex TaqMan PCRs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Sequence analysis of the VDII region of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene revealed seven genovars of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; in PCR-positive patients. The overall genovars were distributed as E (41.9%), G (21.6%), F (13.5%), K (9.5%), D (6.8%), J (4.1%), and H (2.7%). CT-positive samples were from males (n = 12, 19.7%), females (n = 42, 68.8%), and anonymous (n = 7, 11.5%) patients, with an age range of 19 to 45 years (average 26.4), including 12 different ethnic groups representative of this region. Most patients were infected with a single genovar (82%), while 18% were co-infected with either two or three genovars. The 1156 bp-fragment of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene was sequenced in 46 samples to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among isolates. SNP-based subtyping and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of 13 variants of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene, such as E (E1, E2, E6), G (G1, G2, G3, G5), F1, K, D (D1, Da2), J1, and H2. Differing genovar distribution was identified among urban (E&gt;G&gt;F) and rural (E&gt;K) populations, and in Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;D) and non-Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;K) ethnic groups. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) determined five sequences types (STs), such as ST4 (56%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 70.0 to 41.3), ST6 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3), ST9 (22%, 95% CI 35.9 to 11.5), ST10 (2%, 95% CI 10.7 to 0.05) and ST38 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3).

Objective &lt;p&gt;Individuals with metabolic syndrome have increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CR-fitness), counteracts accumulation of visceral fat, decreases inflammation and lowers risk factors of the metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;The study sample included 1,293 Danes (age 49‚Äì52 years) who from 2009 to 2011 participated in the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank, including a questionnaire, physical tests, and blood samples. Multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and plasma levels of cytokines and high sensitive C-reactive protein as outcomes and measures of abdominal obesity were added to test if they explained the potential association. Similarly, multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and factors of the metabolic syndrome as outcomes and the potential explanation by inflammatory biomarkers were tested. All models were adjusted for the effect of age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, socio-economic status, and acute inflammatory events within the preceding two weeks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;CR-fitness was inversely associated with high sensitive C-reactive protein, Interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-18, and directly associated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma or IL-1Œ≤. Abdominal obesity could partly explain the significant associations. Moreover, CR-fitness was inversely associated with an overall metabolic syndrome score, as well as triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin A&lt;sub&gt;1c&lt;/sub&gt;, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and directly associated with high-density lipoprotein. Single inflammatory biomarkers and a combined inflammatory score partly explained these associations.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Data suggest that CR-fitness has anti-inflammatory effects that are partly explained by a reduction in abdominal obesity and a decrease in the metabolic syndrome risk profile. The overall inflammatory load was mainly driven by high sensitive C-reactive protein and IL-6.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4251:9f3b30f2</id><title>Cardiorespiratory fitness and the metabolic syndrome: Roles of inflammation and abdominal obesity</title><fingerprint>891b71d8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne-Sophie Wedell-Neergaard, Rikke Krogh-Madsen, Gitte Lindved Petersen, √Öse Marie Hansen, Bente Klarlund Pedersen, Rikke Lund, Helle Bruunsgaard&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In light of the limited impact the syndromic management approach has had on the global sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic, we assessed a care model comprising point-of-care (POC) STI testing, immediate treatment, and expedited partner therapy (EPT) among a cohort of young women at high HIV risk in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;HIV negative women presenting for STI care underwent POC testing for &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) and &lt;i&gt;Trichomonas vaginalis&lt;/i&gt; (TV), and swabs were sent for NG culture and susceptibility testing. Results were available within 2 hours and women with STIs were immediately treated and offered EPT packs, including medication, condoms, and information for sexual partners. An EPT questionnaire was administered after one week, and women retested for STIs after 6 and 12 weeks. 267 women, median age 23 (IQR 21‚Äì26), were recruited and 88.4% (236/267) reported genital symptoms. STI prevalence was CT 18.4% (95%CI 13.7‚Äì23.0), NG 5.2% (95%CI 2.6‚Äì7.9) and TV 3.0% (95%CI 1.0‚Äì5.0). After 12 weeks, all but one NG and two CT infections were cleared. No cephalosporin-resistant NG was detected. Of 63/267 women (23.6%) diagnosed with STIs, 98.4% (62/63) were offered and 87.1% (54/62) accepted EPT. At one week 88.9% (48/54) stated that their partner had taken the medication. No allergic reactions or social harms were reported. Of 51 women completing 6-week follow up, detection rates were lower amongst women receiving EPT (2.2%, 1/46) compared to those who did not (40.0%, 2/5), p = 0.023. During focus group discussions women supported the care model, because they received a rapid, specific diagnosis, and could facilitate their partners‚Äô treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;POC STI testing and EPT were acceptable to young South African women and their partners, and could play an important role in reducing STI reinfection rates and HIV risk.

Recently, Chick et al., 2015 and Yu et al., 2016 proposed the spectrum-based and tag-based open search methods, respectively, to identify peptides with PTMs. While the performance of these two methods is promising, the identification results vary greatly with respect to the quality of tandem mass spectra and the number of PTMs in peptides.

Background &lt;p&gt;Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a leading cause of premature mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Women of reproductive age are a unique and vulnerable group of RHD patients, due to increased risk of cardiovascular complications and death during pregnancy. Yet, less than 5% of women of childbearing age with RHD in LMICs use contraceptives, and one in five pregnant women with RHD take warfarin despite known teratogenicity. It is unclear whether this suboptimal contraception and anticoagulant use during pregnancy is due to lack of health system resources, limited health literacy, or social pressure to bear children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a mixed methods study of 75 women living with RHD in Uganda. Questionnaires were administered to 50 patients. Transcripts from three focus groups with 25 participants were analyzed using qualitative description methodology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Several themes emerged from the focus groups, including pregnancy as a calculated risk; misconceptions about side-effects of contraceptives and anticoagulation; reproductive decision-making control by male partners, in-laws, or physicians; abandonment of patients by male partners; and considerable stigma against heart disease patients for both their reproductive and financial limitations (often worse than that directed against HIV patients). All questionnaire respondents were told by physicians that their hearts were not strong enough to support a pregnancy. Only 14% used contraception while taking warfarin. All participants felt that society would look poorly on a woman who cannot have children due to a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study of female RHD patients and their attitudes toward cardiovascular disorders and reproduction. Our results suggest that health programs targeting heart disease in LMICs must pay special attention to the needs of women of childbearing age. There are opportunities for improved family/societal education programs and community engagement, leading to better outcomes and patient empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad280e:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Motivations of women in Uganda living with rheumatic heart disease: A mixed methods study of experiences in stigma, childbearing, anticoagulation, and contraception</title><fingerprint>5f3aa237</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Y.

structural modeling and design. The
comparison of differently derived energy functions enables analysis of the
strengths and weaknesses of each energy function, and provides independent
benchmarks for evaluating improvements within a given energy function. We compared the molecular mechanics Amber
empirical energy function to two versions of the Rosetta energy function
(talaris2014 and REF2015) in decoy discrimination and loop modeling tests. Both
Rosetta&apos;s talaris2014 and Amber&apos;s ff14SBonlySC energy functions performed well
in scoring the native state as the lowest energy conformation in many cases. In 24/150 cases with Rosetta, and in 2/150
cases using Amber, a false minimum is found that is absent in the alternative
landscape. In 21/150 cases, both energy function-generated landscapes featured
false minima. The newest version of the Rosetta energy function, REF2015, which
has more physically-derived terms than talaris2014, performs significantly
better, highlighting the improvements made to the Rosetta scoring approach. To
take advantage of the semi-orthogonal nature of these energy functions, we developed
a Pareto optimization approach that combines Amber and Rosetta energy

structural modeling and design. The
comparison of differently derived energy functions enables analysis of the
strengths and weaknesses of each energy function, and provides independent
benchmarks for evaluating improvements within a given energy function. We compared the molecular mechanics Amber
empirical energy function to two versions of the Rosetta energy function
(talaris2014 and REF2015) in decoy discrimination and loop modeling tests. Both
Rosetta&apos;s talaris2014 and Amber&apos;s ff14SBonlySC energy functions performed well
in scoring the native state as the lowest energy conformation in many cases. In 24/150 cases with Rosetta, and in 2/150
cases using Amber, a false minimum is found that is absent in the alternative
landscape. In 21/150 cases, both energy function-generated landscapes featured
false minima. The newest version of the Rosetta energy function, REF2015, which
has more physically-derived terms than talaris2014, performs significantly
better, highlighting the improvements made to the Rosetta scoring approach. To
take advantage of the semi-orthogonal nature of these energy functions, we developed
a Pareto optimization approach that combines Amber and Rosetta energy
landscapes to predict the most near-native model for a given protein. This algorithm
improves upon predictions from either energy function in isolation, and should
aid in model selection for structure prediction and loop modeling tasks.</description></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113</originId><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nbt.4113-F1.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>345</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width></visual><unread>True</unread><author><name>Serghei Mangul</name></author><published>1522911600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>13</engagement><crawled>1522944970711</crawled><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education‚Äìresearch gap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education‚Äìresearch gap, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Engaging undergraduates in computational tasks can improve genomic research laboratory productivity, benefiting both students and senior laboratory members.</content></content><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_16296980fd7:a466566:34f43e70</id><title>Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education‚Äìresearch gap</title><fingerprint>46d1775b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education‚Äìresearch gap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education‚Äìresearch gap, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Engaging undergraduates in computational tasks can improve genomic research laboratory productivity, benefiting both students and senior laboratory members.</description></item><item><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35069</link><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>CRISPR/Cas9 can be used for precise genetic knock-in of epitope tags into endogenous genes, simplifying experimental analysis of protein function.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is not well understood at the molecular level. Exactly why some brain regions produce epileptic discharges and others do not is not known. Patients who fail to respond to antiseizure medication (refractory epilepsy) can benefit from surgical removal of brain regions to reduce seizure frequency. The tissue removed in these surgeries offers an invaluable resource to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of human epilepsy. Here, we report a proteomic study to determine whether there are common proteomic patterns in human brain regions that produce epileptic discharges. We analyzed human brain samples, as part of the Systems Biology of Epilepsy Project (SBEP). These brain pieces are &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized human brain samples withdrawn from the neocortex of six patients with refractory epilepsy. This study is unique in that for each of these six patients the comparison of protein expression was made within the same patient: a more epileptic region was compared to a less epileptic brain region. The amount of epileptic activity was defined for each patient as the frequency of their interictal spikes (electric activity between seizures that is a parameter strongly linked to epilepsy). Proteins were resolved from three subcellular fractions, using a 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), revealing 31 identified protein spots that changed significantly. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was found to be consistently down regulated in high spiking brain tissue and showed a strong negative correlation with spike frequency. We also developed a two-step analysis method to select for protein species that changed frequently among the patients and identified these proteins. A total of 397 protein spots of interest (SOI) were clustered by protein expression patterns across all samples. These clusters were used as markers and this analysis predicted proteomic changes due to both histological differences and molecular pathways, revealed by examination of gene ontology clusters. Our experimental design and proteomic data analysis predicts novel glial changes, increased angiogenesis, and changes in cytoskeleton and neuronal projections between high and low interictal spiking regions. Quantitative histological staining of these same tissues for both the vascular and glial changes confirmed these findings, which provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9ba:9aea0a7d</id><title>Proteomic analysis of human epileptic neocortex predicts vascular and glial changes in epileptic regions</title><fingerprint>6cf59a96</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gal Keren-Aviram, Fabien Dachet, Shruti Bagla, Karina Balan, Jeffrey A.

In the United States (US), the sugarcane aphid (SCA) &lt;i&gt;Melanaphis sacchari&lt;/i&gt; (Zehnter) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was introduced in the 1970s, however at that time it was only considered a pest of sugarcane. In 2013, a massive outbreak of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sacchari&lt;/i&gt; occured on sorghum, resulting in significant economic damage to sorghum grown in North America including the US, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The aim of the present study was to determine if the SCA pest emergence in American sorghum resulted from the introduction of new genotypes. To this end we used microsatellite markers and COI sequencing to compare the genetic diversity of SCA populations collected in the Americas after the 2013 SCA outbreak on sorghum (during 2013‚Äì2017) to older samples collected before the pest outbreak (during 2007‚Äì2009). Our results show that the SCA outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean observed since 2013 belong to populations exhibiting low genetic diversity and consisting of a dominant clonal lineage, MLL-F, which colonizes &lt;i&gt;Sorghum&lt;/i&gt; spp. and sugarcane. The comparison of MLL-F specimens collected post-2013 with specimens collected in Louisiana in 2007 revealed that both populations are genetically distinct, according to COI sequencing and microsatellite data analyses. Our result suggest that MLL-F is a new invasive genotype introduced into the Americas that has spread rapidly across sorghum growing regions in the US, Mexico, Honduras and the Caribbean. The origin of this introduction is either Africa or Asia, with Asia being the most probable source.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b0:91749e5b</id><title>Invasion of sorghum in the Americas by a new sugarcane aphid (&amp;lt;i&gt;Melanaphis sacchari&amp;lt;/i&gt;) superclone</title><fingerprint>d320a996</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Nibouche, Laurent Costet, Jocelyn R.

Outbreaks of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been reported in poultry species in the United States since 2014. These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2‚Äì4 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd074:7c9981b6</id><title>Efficacy and synergy of live-attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccines in young chickens</title><fingerprint>260bbdf1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyesun Jang, Mohamed Elaish, Mahesh KC, Michael C.

Vasculature is an interface between the circulation and the hematopoietic tissue providing the means for hundreds of billions of blood cells to enter the circulation every day in a regulated fashion. The precise mechanisms that control the interactions of hematopoietic cells with the vessel wall are largely undefined. Here, we report on the development of an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; 3D human marrow vascular microenvironment (VME) to study hematopoietic trafficking and the release of blood cells, specifically platelets. We show that mature megakaryocytes from aspirated marrow as well as megakaryocytes differentiated in culture from CD34+ cells can be embedded in a collagen matrix containing engineered microvessels to create a thrombopoietic VME. These megakaryocytes continue to mature, penetrate the vessel wall, and release platelets into the vessel lumen. This process can be blocked with the addition of antibodies specific for CXCR4, indicating that CXCR4 is required for megakaryocyte migration, though whether it is sufficient is unclear. The 3D marrow VME system shows considerable potential for mechanistic studies defining the role of marrow vasculature in thrombopoiesis. Through a stepwise addition or removal of individual marrow components, this model provides potential to define key pathways responsible for the release of platelets and other blood cells.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575ec:34f43e70</id><title>Microvasculature-directed thrombopoiesis in a 3D &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; marrow microenvironment</title><fingerprint>aabb7852</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Surya Kotha, Sijie Sun, Amie Adams, Brian Hayes, Kiet T.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several investigations suggest the presence of deterioration of executive function in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The study quantified executive functions in patients with FMS. A wide array of functions was assessed, including updating, shifting and inhibition, as well as decision making and mental planning. Moreover, clinical variables were investigated as possible mediators of executive dysfunction, including pain severity, psychiatric comorbidity, medication and body mass index (BMI).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Fifty-two FMS patients and 32 healthy controls completed a battery of 14 neuropsychological tests. Clinical interviews were conducted and the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Fatigue Severity Scale and Oviedo Quality of Sleep Questionnaire were presented.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients performed poorer than controls on the Letter Number Sequencing, Arithmetic and Similarities subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Spatial Span subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale, an N-back task, a verbal fluency task, the Ruff Figural Fluency Test, the Inhibition score of the Stroop Test, the Inhibition and Shifting scores of the Five Digits Test, the Key Search Test and the Zoo Map Task. Moreover, patients exhibited less steep learning curves on the Iowa Gambling Task. Among clinical variables, BMI and pain severity explained the largest proportion of performance variance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated impairments in executive functions of updating, shifting inhibition, decision making and planning in FMS. While the mediating role of pain in cognitive impairments in FMS had been previously established, the influence of BMI is a novel finding. Overweight and obesity should be considered by FMS researchers, and in the treatment of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67bd:91749e5b</id><title>Executive function impairments in fibromyalgia syndrome: Relevance of clinical variables and body mass index</title><fingerprint>2fff399b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cristina Mu√±oz Ladr√≥n de Guevara, Mar√≠a Jos√© Fern√°ndez-Serrano, Gustavo A.

They‚Äôve been working with various heme proteins, since that reactive center is known to be able to generate carbenes, and they noted one variant, in the presence of ethyl diazoacetate as a carbene source and an aryl acetylene as reactant, gave furan products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo-300x92.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo-300x92.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo.jpeg 526w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13437&quot; height=&quot;92&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are already reported as coming from a carbene mechanism, so the group thought that they must be on to something. Further screening of variants around that particular enzyme isoform turned up some that allowed a second carbene reaction to cycle around, giving the unusual bicyclobutanes shown at right. Freeing up some room around the active site was essential, otherwise the cyclopropene intermediate goes off to the furan product instead. A systematic screen of amino acid variations at the key residues of the enzyme in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, with monitoring of product production, furnished an enzyme that was capable of high turnover (enough to produce hundreds of milligrams of product). A variety of different R groups are tolerated on the phenyl, with yields from 30 to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene-300x85.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene-300x85.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene.jpeg 382w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13438&quot; height=&quot;85&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the phenylcyclopropene intermediate was not isolable, but the team also look for variants that could produce those products as well (in the non-aryl cases). Similar mutation screens against promising enzymes produced another one that could indeed furnish a variety of cyclopropenes, as shown at right, in yields of 35 to 85%. Variants were found that could produced enhanced ratios of either enantiomer, to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sorts of reactions are known in the literature, up to a point (here‚Äôs a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/Topics/Maciej.pdf&quot;&gt;review presentation&lt;/a&gt; from the Wipf group a few years back on the topic). But such things are mostly seen on very electron-deficient alkynes and often go in lower yields than what are reported here (and I think you can largely forget about enantioselectivity). The fact that enzymes can be made to do such chemistry is remarkable, and there are surely many more such things waiting to be discovered. The metal centers in these proteins do a lot of extraordinary chemistry, and many groups are in the process of harnessing them for synthetic purposes. Seeing unusual strained systems like this being formed so readily just shows how much must be possible!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162afc245d6:1da7622:7c9981b6</id><title>21st Century Enzymes</title><fingerprint>97e6c2fe</fingerprint><description>Here‚Äôs a remarkable paper that shows how enzymes can be engineered to turn out some very unnatural-looking structures.

The bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia was formally described two decades ago and originally believed to be a minor member of many ecosystems; however, it is now recognized as ubiquitous and abundant in both soil and aquatic systems. Nevertheless, knowledge of the drivers of its relative abundance and within-phylum habitat preferences remains sparse, especially in lake systems. Here, we documented the distribution of Verrucomicrobia in 12 inland lakes in Southeastern Michigan, a Laurentian Great Lake (Lake Michigan), and a freshwater estuary, which span a gradient in lake sizes, depths, residence times, and trophic states. A wide range of physical and geochemical parameters was covered by sampling seasonally from the surface and bottom of each lake, and by separating samples into particle-associated and free-living fractions. On average, Verrucomicrobia was the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most abundant phylum (range 1.7‚Äì41.7%). Fraction, season, station, and depth explained up to 70% of the variance in Verrucomicrobia community composition and preference for these habitats was phylogenetically conserved at the class-level. When relative abundance was linearly modeled against environmental data, Verrucomicrobia and non-Verrucomicrobia bacterial community composition correlated to similar quantitative environmental parameters, although there were lake system-dependent differences and &gt; 55% of the variance remained unexplained. A majority of the phylum exhibited preference for the particle-associated fraction and two classes (Opitutae and Verrucomicrobiae) were identified to be more abundant during the spring season. This study highlights the high relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in north temperate lake systems and expands insights into drivers of within-phylum habitat preferences of the Verrucomicrobia.</content></content><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca425a:9f3b30f2</id><title>Verrucomicrobia are prevalent in north-temperate freshwater lakes and display class-level preferences between lake habitats</title><fingerprint>a8448726</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edna Chiang, Marian L.
