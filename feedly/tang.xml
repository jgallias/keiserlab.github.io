Adverse event (AE)-related costs represent an important component of economic models for cancer care. However, since previous studies mostly focused on specific AEs, treatments, or cancer types, limited information is currently available. Therefore, this study assessed the incremental healthcare costs associated with a large number of AEs among patients diagnosed with some of the most prevalent types of cancer. Data were obtained from a large US claims database. Adult patients were included if diagnosed with and treated for one of the following cancer types: breast, digestive organs and peritoneum, genitourinary organs (including bladder and ovary and other uterine adnexa), lung, lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, and skin. Treatment episodes were defined as the period from initiation of the first antineoplastic pharmacologic therapy to discontinuation (i.e., gap of ≥ 45 days), or change in treatment regimen, or end of data availability. A total of 36 AEs were selected from the product inserts of 104 treatments recommended by practice guidelines. A retrospective matched cohort design was used, matching a treatment episode with a certain AE with a treatment episode without that AE. A total of 412,005 patients were selected, for a total of 794,243 treatment episodes, resulting in 1,617,368 matched treatment episodes across all 36 AEs. Incremental healthcare costs associated with AEs of any severity ranged from $546 for cough/upper respiratory infections to $24,633 for gastrointestinal perforation. The three most costly AEs when considering any severity were gastrointestinal perforation ($24,633), central nervous system hemorrhage ($24,322), and sepsis/septicemia ($23,510). Incremental healthcare costs associated with severe AEs ranged from $15,709 for dermatitis and rash to $48,538 for gastrointestinal fistula. The three most costly severe AEs were gastrointestinal fistula ($48,538), gastrointestinal perforation ($41,281), and central nervous system hemorrhage ($38,428). In conclusion, AEs during treatment episodes for cancer were frequent and associated with a substantial economic burden.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Assessment of costs associated with adverse events in patients with cancer</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</originId><fingerprint>1d64ea7d</fingerprint><author><name>William Wong</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523653200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363f:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by William Wong, Yeun Mi Yim, Ashley Kim, Martin Cloutier, Marjolaine Gauthier-Loiselle, Patrick Gagnon-Sanschagrin, Annie Guerin&lt;/p&gt;

The environmental fates of pharmaceuticals and the effects of crop protection products on non-target species are subjects that are undergoing intense review. Since measuring the concentrations and effects of xenobiotics on all affected species under all conceivable scenarios is not feasible, standard laboratory animals such as rabbits are tested, and the observed adverse effects are translated to focal species for environmental risk assessments. In that respect, mathematical modelling is becoming increasingly important for evaluating the consequences of pesticides in untested scenarios. In particular, physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (PBPK/TK) modelling is a well-established methodology used to predict tissue concentrations based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs and toxicants. In the present work, a rabbit PBPK/TK model is developed and evaluated with data available from the literature. The model predictions include scenarios of both intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) administration of small and large compounds. The presented rabbit PBPK/TK model predicts the pharmacokinetics (Cmax, AUC) of the tested compounds with an average 1.7-fold error. This result indicates a good predictive capacity of the model, which enables its use for risk assessment modelling and simulations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Development and validation of a physiology-based model for the prediction of pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics in rabbits</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194294</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194294</originId><fingerprint>b4ac6c98</fingerprint><author><name>Panteleimon D.

Polyploidization has played an important role in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly at the base of Teleostei–an enormously successful ray-finned fish group with additional genome doublings on lower taxonomic levels. The investigation of post-polyploid genome dynamics might provide important clues about the evolution and ecology of respective species and can help to decipher the role of polyploidy &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on speciation. Few studies have attempted to investigate the dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences in the post-polyploid genome using molecular cytogenetic tools in fishes, though recent efforts demonstrated their usefulness. The demonstrably monophyletic freshwater loach family Botiidae, branching to evolutionary diploid and tetraploid lineages separated &gt;25 Mya, offers a suited model group for comparing the long-term repetitive DNA evolution. For this, we integrated phylogenetic analyses with cytogenetical survey involving Giemsa- and Chromomycin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/DAPI stainings and fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization with 5S/45S rDNA, U2 snDNA and telomeric probes in representative sample of 12 botiid species.
The karyotypes of all diploids were composed of 2n = 50 chromosomes, while majority of tetraploids had 2n = 4x = 100, with only subtle interspecific karyotype differences. The exceptional karyotype of &lt;i&gt;Botia dario&lt;/i&gt; (2n = 4x = 96) suggested centric fusions behind the 2n reduction. Variable patterns of FISH signals revealed cases of intraspecific polymorphisms, rDNA amplification, variable degree of correspondence with CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and almost no phylogenetic signal. In tetraploids, either additivity or loci gain/loss was recorded. Despite absence of classical interstitial telomeric sites, large blocks of interspersed rDNA/telomeric regions were found in diploids only.
We uncovered different molecular drives of studied repetitive DNA classes within botiid genomes as well as the advanced stage of the re-diploidization process in tetraploids. Our results may contribute to link genomic approach with molecular cytogenetic analyses in addressing the origin and mechanism of this polyploidization event.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Dynamics of tandemly repeated DNA sequences during evolution of diploid and tetraploid botiid loaches (Teleostei: Cobitoidea: Botiidae)</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195054</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195054</originId><fingerprint>b6e8f653</fingerprint><author><name>Alexandr Sember</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195054</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4255:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandr Sember, Jörg Bohlen, Vendula Šlechtová, Marie Altmanová, Šárka Pelikánová, Petr Ráb&lt;/p&gt;

Although associations between oral health and pneumonia have been reported in previous studies, particularly in the institutionalized elderly, few prospective studies have investigated the association between oral condition and pneumonia among community-dwelling people and whether the findings among inpatients or patients in nursing homes are applicable to the general population is still unclear. The oral bacteria propagated in the periodontal regions may drop into the lung and increase the risk of pneumonia. We, therefore, investigated the association of tooth loss with mortality from pneumonia in a cohort study of Japanese dentists. Members of the Japan Dental Association (JDA) participated in the LEMONADE (Longitudinal Evaluation of Multi-phasic, Odontological and Nutritional Associations in Dentists) Study. From 2001 to 2006, they completed a baseline questionnaire on lifestyle and health factors including the number of teeth lost (excluding third molars). We followed 19,775 participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 51.4 ± 11.7 years; 1,573 women [8.0%] and 18,202 men [92.0%]) for mortality from pneumonia (ICD-10, J12-J18). Mortality data were collected via the fraternal insurance program of the JDA. The hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, physical activity and diabetes history. During the median follow-up period of 9.5 years, we documented 68 deaths from pneumonia. Participants who were edentulous at baseline were at significantly increased risk of mortality from pneumonia. The multivariable-adjusted HRs were 2.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–3.95) for the edentulous and 1.60 (95% CI, 0.83–3.10) for loss of 15–27 teeth relative to loss of 0–14 teeth (trend &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.026). The HR per one tooth loss was also significant; 1.031 (95% CI, 1.004–1.060). In conclusion, a large number of teeth lost may indicate an increased risk of mortality from pneumonia in community-dwelling populations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Tooth loss and pneumonia mortality: A cohort study of Japanese dentists</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195813</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195813</originId><fingerprint>a79ebb1b</fingerprint><author><name>Shino Suma</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195813</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523653200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793630:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shino Suma, Mariko Naito, Kenji Wakai, Toru Naito, Masaaki Kojima, Osami Umemura, Makoto Yokota, Nobuhiro Hanada, Takashi Kawamura&lt;/p&gt;

I can state as a fact that the first time I heard a joking reference to his attitude towards traditional synthetic organic chemistry was in the summer of 1983, so it’s not like he’s been keeping his thoughts bottled up. But this is certainly a good summary of them, and here’s the key question that’s being asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The ability to put together molecules – bit‐by‐bit, simple or complex – is one of chemistry’s great accomplishments, and a source of amazement to those in many other fields of science. More than one physicist has told me that s/he cannot believe that it is possible to manipulate bonds between individual atoms with the skill that organic chemists do. When I look at a complex structure assembled in a beautifully organized campaign, I also am amazed. That said, all fields of science morph with time. The phrase “organic synthesis” has come to mean “synthesis of structurally complex natural products”, or, perhaps, “synthesis of complicated molecules with pharmaceutical activity.” Nature, and relevance to healthcare, define the targets, and provide the utilitarian justification for the effort. Is there (or should there be) more to it than that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidiary questions are whether organic synthesis of that sort is worth the effort that’s being put into it and whether it trains students to do useful things and whether other types of work could do a better job of that. In order to address these, Whitesides notes, we have to make sure that we’re talking about the same things. He defines “organic synthesis” (small letters) as any sort of putting-together-of-organic molecules, and “Organic Synthesis” (with the capitals) as the sort of complex and often natural-product-based synthesis practiced by R. B. Woodward, his contemporaries, and his intellectual heirs. The latter is what many people mean by those two words, to be sure, and Whitesides has some questions about just what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the field a science that generates new concepts and new theory? Is it instead more of an art form, driven at least partly by aesthetic choices (that can be appreciated by skilled observers) rather than utility &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;? Or is it something of a craft, achieving its results (in the end) through skilled empirical tinkering? These questions, especially in the way that they’re phrased, are likely to cause intense annoyance in some practitioners. But I think that the annoyance is a sign that these categories are uncomfortably plausible and recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the field partakes of all of these characteristics, but on what proportions? I think that the science/craft distinction is actually one question, and that these are on the same scale with opposite signs: the more solid the theoretical framework, the less Edisonian tinkering. My opinion is toward the Edisonian end. Organic synthesis is not bereft of theories and organizing concepts, but they do not operate strongly enough (that is, in a detailed enough fashion) to allow us to predict (for example) reaction conditions. That’s why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. The same goes for predicting new reactions, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/11/24/reaction_discovery_reviewed&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. No one sat down a few decades ago and said “Y’know, my knowledge of organometallic chemistry allows me to predict that palladium, in particular, will show oxidative addition/reductive elimination behavior that will be spectacularly useful in carbon-carbon bond formation. And while I’m making bold predictions, you might try aryl boronic acids for that reaction first, even though hardly any such things have even been described”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for art, I would very much like to have a dollar for every total-synthesis person who has talked about the field in terms of its artistic qualities. We have Woodward to thank for this – the man was a &lt;em&gt;tremendous&lt;/em&gt; scientist, but his influence has &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/22/woodwards-prose-style&quot;&gt;not always been&lt;/a&gt; for the good. I don’t think nearly as many people went into spasms about elegance and beauty in reference to total synthesis before him, and what’s more annoying is that those are valid concepts to apply even if Woodward sometimes came across like an Aubrey Beardsley aesthete about them. My own view is that we should let the artistic qualities of organic synthesis, which exist, speak for themselves. Because if they can’t, no amount of &lt;em&gt;raffiniert&lt;/em&gt; gushing about them will substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitesides isn’t through. That three-parter is just his first of three questions! The second one is a two-parter: is organic synthesis best thought of as an enabling technology to do things (such as make drugs, etc.) or as a framework that lets us ask questions about the nature of molecules and their behavior? That is, are the uses to which we put this field, and the justifications we give for it, best described as practical ones or intellectual ones? We tend to haul out the former first and start talking in better-living-through-(organic)-chemistry style, and that’s understandable. Compounds made through organic synthesis, and available through no other practical means, are crucial underpinnings of the modern world. If we’re not proud of that, what are we to be proud of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that second justification, while it sounds like more aesthetic hand-waving to the lay public (and to funding agencies), has some staying power. Ask the physicists, or even the mathematicians. Asking fundamental questions, and having the right framework in which to be able to ask them, can pay off hugely even from the practical end, intellectual satisfaction aside. There’s a lot of number theory that was just another ornament of mathematics until it became vital for modern cryptography and secure communications (G. H. Hardy would have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2IK9D0o&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;horrified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Relativity was a fantastic intellectual feat by Einstein, but relativistic corrections are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html&quot;&gt;needed&lt;/a&gt; to make the GPS system work correctly, among many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third question is, what should we teach chemistry students about the field? That is, what are the most important things for them to know? There’s a massive pile of empirical knowledge, famously dreaded by sophomores, but it’s taught (or should be!) according to general organizing principles – although those are the very ones that are not quite adequate enough to explain everything that’s going on. At what level should we teach this subject? You can say “Here are reactions that depend on alpha-carbonyl anions, and here’s why they happen”, you can say “Time to learn the difference between the Dieckmann and Claisen condensations”, or “Here are the kinds of products these reactions form and what they’re used for”, or “Here are some tips on how to run these things at the bench”, and on and on. What should be in the syllabus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own take on this is that there should definitely be a bias towards the general principles, which is what the better organic chemistry professors already do. Teaching the subject as a pile of reactions is a crime. I may be too loose about this stuff, but I would rather a student, if it came down to it, mess up a bit on the detailed mechanism of the Mitsunobu reaction if they understand that its driving force is the thermodynamic sink of triphenylphosphine oxide formation. The difference between the Dieckmann and the Claisen condensations is that the former is intramolecular and the latter is intermolecular, but I think it’s a waste of brain space to give them different names and memorize them as such. I would much rather that a student, in this case, immediately recognize the mechanism of an alpha-carbonyl anion attacking an ester carbonyl (no matter what the name associated with that process is) and recognize the influence of the leaving group of the ester, the stability vs. reactivity characteristics of the nucleophile, the likelihood of the various ring sizes being formed in the intramolecular reaction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nowhere near exhausted the Annoying Questions of George Whitesides, but this post is long enough as it is!

Mechanical ventilation is an important tool for supporting critically ill patients but may also exert pathological forces on lung cells leading to Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). We hypothesised that inhibition of the force-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV4) ion channel may attenuate the negative effects of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical stretch increased intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung epithelial cells that was partially blocked by about 30% with the selective TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874, but nearly completely blocked with the pan-calcium channel blocker ruthenium red, suggesting the involvement of more than one calcium channel in the response to mechanical stress. Mechanical stretch also induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages, but in contrast this was entirely dependent upon TRPV4. In a murine ventilation model, TRPV4 inhibition attenuated both pulmonary barrier permeability increase and pro-inflammatory cytokines release due to high tidal volume ventilation. Taken together, these data suggest TRPV4 inhibitors may have utility as a prophylactic pharmacological treatment to improve the negative pathological stretch-response of lung cells during ventilation and potentially support patients receiving mechanical ventilation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>TRPV4 inhibition attenuates stretch-induced inflammatory cellular responses and lung barrier dysfunction during mechanical ventilation</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196055</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196055</originId><fingerprint>425da426</fingerprint><author><name>N.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess the association between perceived social support and induced abortion among young women in Lima, Peru. In addition, prevalence and incidence of induced abortion was estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study enrolling women aged 18–25 years from maternal health centers in Southern Lima, Peru, was conducted. Induced abortion was defined as the difference between the total number of pregnancies ended in abortion and the number of spontaneous abortions; whereas perceived social support was assessed using the DUKE-UNC scale. Prevalence and incidence of induced abortion (per 100 person-years risk) was estimated, and the association of interest was evaluated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. A total of 298 women were enrolled, mean age 21.7 (± 2.2) years. Low levels of social support were found in 43.6% (95%CI 38.0%–49.3%), and 17.4% (95%CI: 13.1%– 21.8%) women reported at least one induced abortion. The incidence of induced abortion was 2.37 (95%CI: 1.81–3.11) per 100 person-years risk. The multivariable model showed evidence of the association between low perceived social support and induced abortion (RR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.14–3.30) after controlling for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was evidence of an association between low perceived social support and induced abortion among women aged 18 to 25 years. Incidence of induced abortion was similar or even greater than rates of countries where abortion is legal. Strategies to increase social support and reduce induced abortion rates are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Association between perceived social support and induced abortion: A study in maternal health centers in Lima, Peru</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0192764</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0192764</originId><fingerprint>1c859bfd</fingerprint><author><name>Luis E.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We investigated whether polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt;, or in the autoinflammatory &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; genes, concur with &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; in enhancing the risk of Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and/or in predicting the response to anti-TNFα treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;373 controls and 137 SpA (82 with Psoriatic Arthritis-PsA and 55 with Ankylosing Spondylitis- AS; 98/137 under TNFα inhibitor therapy) from the Veneto Region (Italy) were studied. &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms (-1031T&gt;C;-857C&gt;T;-376G&gt;A;-308G&gt;A;-238G&gt;A) and &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; were assayed by RT-PCR.

Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance.

Background &lt;p&gt;Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are biomarkers for several neoplastic diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a literature search, followed by experimental screening and validation in order to establish a miRNA panel in combination with the assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and to evaluate its performance in HCC diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Expression of miRNAs was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 406 serum samples from 118 Vietnamese patients with hepatitis B (HBV)-related HCC, 69 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 100 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 119 healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three miRNAs (mir-21, mir-122, mir-192) were expressed differentially among the studied subgroups and positively correlated with AFP levels. The individual miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir192 or the triplex miRNA panel showed high diagnostic accuracy for HCC (HCC vs. CHB, AUC = 0.906; HCC vs. CHB+LC, AUC = 0.81; HCC vs. CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.854). When AFP levels were ≤20ng/ml, the triplex miRNA panel still was accurate in distinguishing HCC from the other conditions (CHB, AUC = 0.922; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.836; CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.862). When AFP levels were used in combination with the triplex miRNA panel, the diagnostic performance was significantly improved in discriminating HCC from the other groups (LC, AUC = 0.887; CHB, AUC = 0.948; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.887).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The three miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir-192, together with AFP, are biomarkers that may be applied to improve diagnostics of HCC in HBV patients, especially in HBV-related LC patients with normal AFP levels or HCC patients with small tumor sizes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Optimisation of quantitative miRNA panels to consolidate the diagnostic surveillance of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196081</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196081</originId><fingerprint>c916d09</fingerprint><author><name>Ngo Tat Trung</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196081</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524171600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f78f6:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ngo Tat Trung, Dang Chieu Duong, Hoang Van Tong, Tran Thi Thu Hien, Phan Quoc Hoan, Mai Hong Bang, Mai Thanh Binh, Thai Doan Ky, Nguyen Lam Tung, Nguyen Tien Thinh, Vu Viet Sang, Le Thi Phuong Thao, C-Thomas Bock, Thirumalaisamy P.

The development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies through mouse immunization often originates drug candidates that are not cross-reactive to the mouse ortholog. In such cases, and particularly in oncology, drug efficacy studies are performed on human tumor xenografts or with “surrogate” anti-mouse ortholog antibodies if targeting tumor host cells. Safety assessment of drug candidate(s) is performed at a later development stage in healthy non-human primates. While the latter remains necessary before a drug advances into human subjects, it precludes evaluation of safety in disease conditions and drug de-risking during early development. Therefore, mouse models that allow concomitant evaluation of drug efficacy and safety are highly desirable. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is an attractive target for tumor-targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics, with multiple mouse immunization-derived antibodies undergoing clinical trials. Given the pleiotropic role of CXCR4 in cancer biology, we anticipate continuous interest in this target, particularly in the testing of therapeutic combinations for immuno-oncology. Here, we describe the generation and validation of the first mouse knock-in of the whole coding region of human CXCR4. Homozygous human CXCR4 knock-in (hereafter designated as HuCXCR4KI) mice were viable and outwardly healthy, reproduced normally and nursed their young. The expression pattern of human CXCR4 in this model was similar to that of CXCR4 expression in normal human tissues. The human CXCR4 knock-in gene was expressed as a biologically active protein, thereby allowing normal animal development and adequate”homing” of leukocytes to the bone marrow. To further validate our model, we used an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; functional assay of leukocyte mobilization from bone marrow to peripheral blood by blocking CXCR4 signaling. Both an anti-human CXCR4 -specific blocking antibody and the small molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 induced increased leukocyte counts in peripheral blood, whereas an anti-mouse CXCR4 –specific blocking antibody had no effect. This new mouse model is useful to evaluate efficacy and safety of anti-human CXCR4 -specific drugs as single agents or in combination therapies, particularly in the oncology, immuno-oncology, wound healing and chronic inflammation therapeutic areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A mouse model for evaluation of efficacy and concomitant toxicity of anti-human CXCR4 therapeutics</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194688</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194688</originId><fingerprint>1052c34b</fingerprint><author><name>Maria José Costa</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194688</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521493200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f8907:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria José Costa, Jyothirmayee Kudaravalli, Wen-Hui Liu, Jeffrey Stock, Sophanna Kong, Shu-Hui Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a live, viral vaccine under advanced development as a non-replicating smallpox vaccine. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted to demonstrate the humoral immunogenic equivalence of three consecutively manufactured MVA production lots, and to confirm the safety and tolerability of MVA focusing on cardiac readouts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The trial was conducted at 34 sites in the US. Vaccinia-naïve adults aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups using a 1:1:1:1 randomization scheme. Subjects received either two MVA injections from three consecutive lots (Groups 1-3), or two placebo injections (Group 4), four weeks apart. Everyone except personnel involved in vaccine handling and administration was blinded to treatment. Safety assessment focused on cardiac monitoring throughout the trial. Vaccinia-specific antibody titers were measured using a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The primary immunogenicity endpoint was Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after two MVA vaccinations measured by PRNT at trial visit 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01144637.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 2013 and May 2014, 4005 subjects were enrolled and received at least one injection of MVA (n = 3003) or placebo (n = 1002). The three MVA lots induced equivalent antibody titers two weeks after the second vaccination, with seroconversion rates of 99·8% (PRNT) and 99·7% (ELISA). Overall, 180 (6·0%) subjects receiving MVA and 29 (2·9%) subjects in the placebo group reported at least one unsolicited Adverse Event (AE) that was considered trial-related.

Background &lt;p&gt;Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a live, viral vaccine under advanced development as a non-replicating smallpox vaccine. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted to demonstrate the humoral immunogenic equivalence of three consecutively manufactured MVA production lots, and to confirm the safety and tolerability of MVA focusing on cardiac readouts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The trial was conducted at 34 sites in the US. Vaccinia-naïve adults aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups using a 1:1:1:1 randomization scheme. Subjects received either two MVA injections from three consecutive lots (Groups 1-3), or two placebo injections (Group 4), four weeks apart. Everyone except personnel involved in vaccine handling and administration was blinded to treatment. Safety assessment focused on cardiac monitoring throughout the trial. Vaccinia-specific antibody titers were measured using a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The primary immunogenicity endpoint was Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after two MVA vaccinations measured by PRNT at trial visit 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01144637.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 2013 and May 2014, 4005 subjects were enrolled and received at least one injection of MVA (n = 3003) or placebo (n = 1002). The three MVA lots induced equivalent antibody titers two weeks after the second vaccination, with seroconversion rates of 99·8% (PRNT) and 99·7% (ELISA). Overall, 180 (6·0%) subjects receiving MVA and 29 (2·9%) subjects in the placebo group reported at least one unsolicited Adverse Event (AE) that was considered trial-related. Vaccination was well tolerated without significant safety concerns, particularly regarding cardiac assessment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The neutralizing and total antibody titers induced by each of the three lots were equivalent. No significant safety concerns emerged in this healthy trial population, especially regarding cardiac safety, thus confirming the excellent safety and tolerability profile of MVA.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01144637&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195897</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523641501164</crawled></item><item><content><content>Iron may critically influence the physical properties and thermochemical structures of Earth’s lower mantle.

Networks in nature rarely function in isolation but instead interact with one another with a form of a network of networks (NoN). A network of networks with interdependency between distinct networks contains instability of abrupt collapse related to the global rule of activation. As a remedy of the collapse instability, here we investigate a model of correlated NoN. We find that the collapse instability can be removed when hubs provide the majority of interconnections and interconnections are convergent between hubs. Thus, our study identifies a stable structure of correlated NoN against catastrophic failures. Our result further suggests a plausible way to enhance network robustness by manipulating connection patterns, along with other methods such as controlling the state of node based on a local rule.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Correlated network of networks enhances robustness against catastrophic failures</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195539</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195539</originId><fingerprint>abd3e7f7</fingerprint><author><name>Byungjoon Min</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195539</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524085200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccae:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byungjoon Min, Muhua Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic assessment tools remain suboptimal in demonstrating complex morphology of congenital heart disease (CHD). This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing. Qualitative analysis was conducted by distributing surveys to six health professionals (two radiologists, two cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons) and three medical academics to assess the clinical value of the 3D printed model in these three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was noted in the measurements between CCTA and 3D printed model, with a mean difference of 0.23 mm. Four out of six health professionals found the model to be useful in facilitating preoperative planning, while all of them thought that the model would be invaluable in enhancing patient-doctor communication. All three medical academics found the model to be helpful in teaching, and thought that the students will be able to learn the pathology quicker with better understanding.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The complex cardiac anatomy can be accurately replicated in flexible material using 3D printing technology. 3D printed heart models could serve as an excellent tool in facilitating preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education, although further studies with inclusion of more clinical cases are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Clinical value of patient-specific three-dimensional printing of congenital heart disease: Quantitative and qualitative assessments</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</originId><fingerprint>2e27b850</fingerprint><author><name>Ivan Wen Wen Lau</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521666000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e5:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Wen Wen Lau, Dongting Liu, Lei Xu, Zhanming Fan, Zhonghua Sun&lt;/p&gt;

Despite this, transcriptomic analyses of the human brain have typically been conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of performing single-cell type analyses with donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary cortical cell types in previous publications. Using this database, we predicted the relative cell type composition for 833 human cortical samples using microarray or RNA-Seq data from the Pritzker Consortium (GSE92538) or publicly-available databases (GSE53987, GSE21935, GSE21138, CommonMind Consortium).

Using this method, we found that the principal components of variation in the datasets strongly correlated with the neuron to glia ratio of the samples.

We therefore expect that the scheme reported in this work will provide a valuable stepping stone between classical conceptual chemistry and quantum chemical topology. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1523357019000</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162cf83c33e:2b0824b:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25223?af=R</link><crawled>1523899941694</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cooperative STAT/NF-κB signaling regulates lymphoma metabolic reprogramming and aberrant &lt;i&gt;GOT2&lt;/i&gt; expression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooperative STAT/NF-κB signaling regulates lymphoma metabolic reprogramming and aberrant &amp;lt;i&gt;GOT2&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03803-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03803-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Metabolic rewiring of cancer cells can be driven by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors.

The authors are going over a number of areas where medicinal chemistry could make use of more advanced synthetic techniques, and they’re good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, “&lt;em&gt;From an industry perspective, the most common challenge for any new synthetic method is its level of tolerance to the polar functional groups and nitrogen heteroatoms found in biologically active molecules.&lt;/em&gt;” Yes indeed. That’s what I look at when I see a neat new transformation in the literature – what did it work on? Basic amines OK? Tertiary or secondary? Secondary amides tolerated? Carboxylic acids? Free OH groups? I’m disappointed sometimes when I find that a reaction can’t tolerate these, but I’m glad that the papers involved at least went to the trouble of finding the limits to their chemistry. Far worse than that is a paper that tiptoes around the issues of chemical compatibility, leaving you to find out for yourself – if you’re so inclined, and often one is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area identified is late-stage functionalization, C-H bond activation, etc. Those reactions are always welcome, for sure. Chemical diversity is one of the names of the game that we play, and anything that allows us to get more of it quickly and reliably is good news. Blending with the above, the more complex and functionalized the molecules that can be used as substrates for such chemistry, the better. We’ll take fluorination, hydroxylation, amination, addition of methoxy, trifluoromethyl, what have you. It’s great to be able to predict where the functionalization will happen, of course, but there’s value in things that just sort of go in and mess with structures, too: new molecules! After all, that’s what the liver enzymes do to our drugs; we’re used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also calls for new ways to synthesize and functionalize small heterocyclic rings, new metal-catalyzed coupling reactions (and new C-C bond-forming reactions in general), more biomolecule-compatible reactions, and more. It also goes briefly into machine-assisted synthesis and software-assisted retrosynthesis, but the bulk of the paper is on synthetic methods, and I can only cheer on their suggestions. These are all potential areas for academic-industrial collaboration to generate new chemistry, because everyone benefits from success in these areas (indeed, some of this collaboration goes on already for just these reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I enjoyed this paper very much, but it starts off with a claim that’s worth arguing about: “&lt;em&gt;organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects&lt;/em&gt;“. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on where you’re standing. All the synthetic limitations described above are real, and they keep us from being able to make a lot of molecules that we’d otherwise be cranking out. But (and this is a big point) it’s rarely the case that we medicinal chemists identify a tricky new structure that absolutely has to be made. That sounds odd, but it comes down to our predictive powers, which aren’t so great. We don’t generally draw some wild compound up on the hood sash and say “That’s the one, folks: find a way to make it or die trying”. We never know which is the one, so in the absence of knowing, we make the things that we can make in the ways that we can make them, and honestly, much of the time, we can manage to come up with something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, though, things like the ability to make more polar compounds reliably and quickly would probably lead to better and more structurally diverse drug candidates and screening compounds, not to mention better starting points for projects in general. We just don’t know which ones. The main examples of specific compounds I can think of are metabolites or potential metabolites, where the liver has made some new polar compound out of an existing drug candidate, and we need to make the new compound(s) for testing. Those can be tough, and sometimes the only way is to grind out small quantities by exposing the drug to liver tissue itself (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for times we can’t come up with something, I would like to believe that far more diverse and interesting sets of compounds, millions of them, would allow for real hits to be found against target classes that we currently have trouble attacking. But that remains to be proven, if it ever can be. Chemical space is so large that you can always say “Well, your compound set still wasn’t big enough – the good ones are still out there”, and there’s no way to say that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the real killers in drug discovery stem from – to put it mildly – our incomplete understanding of biology. It’s Phase II and Phase III failures that hammer us, and those happen because we don’t understand our desirable (and undesirable) mechanisms of action enough, leading to failures in efficacy and safety. Even worse, they come after a big pile of money has been spent. Compared to these problems, generating chemical matter is not as big a concern. We already generate enough chemical matter to send all sorts of stuff into the clinic, where 80 to 90% of it dies for other reasons entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic chemistry is, of course, crucial to making small-molecule drugs, and you’d think that would be enough. But as a chemist, I wish that organic synthesis were more relevant to these deep problems. But in the big picture, it isn’t quite so. Chemical biology, as a field, is an attempt to make that happen, but How to Make will never be able to answer questions of What to Make and Why.&lt;/p&gt;

A number of different genetics-based vector control methods have been proposed. Two approaches currently under development in &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes are the two-locus engineered underdominance and killer-rescue gene drive systems. Each of these is theoretically capable of increasing in frequency within a population, thus spreading associated desirable genetic traits. Thus they have gained attention for their potential to aid in the fight against various mosquito-vectored diseases. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. it is self-sustaining) whilst in the killer-rescue system the rescue component should initially increase in frequency (while the lethal component (killer) is common) before eventually declining (when the killer is rare) and being eliminated (i.e. it is temporally self-limiting). The population genetics of both systems have been explored using discrete generation mathematical models. The effects of various ecological factors on these two systems have also been considered using alternative modelling methodologies. Here we formulate and analyse new mathematical models combining the population dynamics and population genetics of these two classes of gene drive that incorporate ecological factors not previously studied and are simple enough to allow the effects of each to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on the potential effects that may be obtained as a result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; and the relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared with their wild-type counterparts. We also extend our models to consider population dynamics in two demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal between neighbouring populations on the outcome of UD and KR gene drive systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3QzCHPdoiAg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Population dynamics of engineered underdominance and killer-rescue gene drives in the control of disease vectors</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006059</link><recrawled>1521836646231</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006059</originId><fingerprint>b57739f6</fingerprint><author><name>Matthew P.

Our work has important implications for gut microbial community modeling as well as ecological interaction detection from batch cultures.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299644v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>5c6924c4</fingerprint><author><name>D&apos;hoe, K.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299644v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523430000000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162b6c31bbb:90c9df:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299644v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/11/299644</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523484662715</crawled></item><item><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25173?af=R</originId><fingerprint>acffb0cd</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25173?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522118290699</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626551ed0b:6ce03:76251cdd</id><unread>False</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25173?af=R</link><crawled>1522118290699</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amirhossein Aghamohammadi, Mei Choo Ang, Elankovan A.

This allows to obtain complete transcripts, which offers an unprecedented vision of the cellular transcriptome. However the literature is lacking tools to cluster such data de novo, in particular for Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads, because of the inherent high error rate compared to short reads. Our goal is to process reads from whole transcriptome sequencing data accurately and without a reference genome in order to reliably group reads coming from the same gene.

This allows to obtain complete transcripts, which offers an unprecedented vision of the cellular transcriptome. However the literature is lacking tools to cluster such data de novo, in particular for Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads, because of the inherent high error rate compared to short reads. Our goal is to process reads from whole transcriptome sequencing data accurately and without a reference genome in order to reliably group reads coming from the same gene. This de novo approach is therefore particularly suitable for non-model species, but can also serve as a useful pre-processing step to improve read mapping. Our contribution is both to propose a new algorithm adapted to clustering of reads by gene and a practical and free access tool that permits to scale the complete processing of eukaryotic transcriptomes.

When unifying genomic resources among studies and comparing data between species, there is often no better resource than a genome sequence. Having a reference genome for the Chinook salmon (&lt;i&gt;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&lt;/i&gt;) will enable the extensive genomic resources available for Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow trout to be leveraged when asking questions related to the Chinook salmon. The Chinook salmon’s wide distribution, long cultural impact, evolutionary history, substantial hatchery production, and recent wild-population decline make it an important research species. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a Chilliwack River Hatchery female Chinook salmon (gynogenetic and homozygous at all loci). With a reference genome sequence, new questions can be asked about the nature of this species, and its role in a rapidly changing world.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Chinook salmon (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&amp;lt;/i&gt;) genome and transcriptome</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195461</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195461</originId><fingerprint>73fbc1ab</fingerprint><author><name>Kris A.

With a reference genome sequence, new questions can be asked about the nature of this species, and its role in a rapidly changing world.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195461</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Axonal growth after traumatic spinal cord injury is limited by endogenous inhibitors, selective blockade of which promotes partial neurological recovery.

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium abscessus&lt;/i&gt;, a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium, are increasingly present in soft tissue infections and chronic lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, and infections are characterized by growth in neutrophil-rich environments. &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; is observed as two distinct smooth and rough morphotypes. The environmental smooth morphotype initiates infection and has a relatively limited ability to activate neutrophils. The rough morphotype has increased virulence and immunogenicity. However, the neutrophil response to the rough morphotype has not been explored. Killing of the smooth and rough strains, including cystic fibrosis clinical isolates, was equivalent. Neutrophil uptake of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; was similar between morphotypes. Mechanistically, both rough and smooth morphotypes enhanced neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation but inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity did not affect &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; viability. However, inhibition of phagocytosis and extracellular traps reduced killing of the smooth morphotype with lesser effects against the rough morphotype.

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium abscessus&lt;/i&gt;, a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium, are increasingly present in soft tissue infections and chronic lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, and infections are characterized by growth in neutrophil-rich environments. &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; is observed as two distinct smooth and rough morphotypes. The environmental smooth morphotype initiates infection and has a relatively limited ability to activate neutrophils. The rough morphotype has increased virulence and immunogenicity. However, the neutrophil response to the rough morphotype has not been explored. Killing of the smooth and rough strains, including cystic fibrosis clinical isolates, was equivalent. Neutrophil uptake of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; was similar between morphotypes. Mechanistically, both rough and smooth morphotypes enhanced neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation but inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity did not affect &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; viability. However, inhibition of phagocytosis and extracellular traps reduced killing of the smooth morphotype with lesser effects against the rough morphotype. Neutrophils treated with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; released a heat-labile mycobactericidal activity against the rough morphotype, but the activity was heat-tolerant against the smooth morphotype. Overall, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; stimulates ineffective neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation, and key mechanisms differ in killing of the smooth (phagocytosis-dependent, extracellular traps, and heat-tolerant secreted factor) and rough (extracellular traps and a heat-labile secreted factor) morphotypes.

The modulatory role of the primary motor cortex (M1), reflected by an inhibitory effect of M1-stimulation on clinical pain, motivated us to deepen our understanding of M1’s role in pain modulation. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced virtual lesion (VL) to interrupt with M1 activity during noxious heat pain. We hypothesized that TMS-VL will effect experimental pain ratings. Three VL protocols were applied consisting of single-pulse TMS to transiently interfere with right M1 activity: (1) VL&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt;- TMS applied to 11 subjects, 20 msec before the individual’s first pain-related M1 peak activation, as determined by source analysis (sLORETA), (2) VL&lt;sub&gt;-50&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 50 ms prior to noxious stimulus onset), and (3) VL&lt;sub&gt;+150&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 150 ms after noxious stimulus onset). Each protocol included 3 conditions (&apos;pain-alone&apos;, &apos; TMS-VL&apos;, and ‘SHAM-VL’), each consisted of 30 noxious heat stimuli. Pain ratings were compared, in each protocol, for TMS-VL vs. SHAM-VL and vs. pain-alone conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance, corrected for multiple comparisons revealed no significant differences in the pain ratings between the different conditions within each protocol. Therefore, our results from this exploratory study suggest that a single pulse TMS-induced VL that is targeted to M1 failed to interrupt experimental pain processing in the specific three stimulation timing examined here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Can a single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation targeted to the motor cortex interrupt pain processing?</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</originId><fingerprint>228e14c4</fingerprint><author><name>Lee-Bareket Kisler</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523307600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a1:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lee-Bareket Kisler, Ilan Gurion, Yelena Granovsky, Alon Sinai, Elliot Sprecher, Simone Shamay-Tsoory, Irit Weissman-Fogel&lt;/p&gt;

The molecular mechanisms through which dendritic cells (DCs) prime T helper 2 (Th2) responses, including those elicited by parasitic helminths, remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that soluble egg antigen (SEA) from &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, which is well known to drive potent Th2 responses, triggers DCs to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which subsequently—in an autocrine manner—induces OX40 ligand (OX40L) expression to license these DCs to drive Th2 responses. Mechanistically, SEA was found to promote PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis through Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, and via a downstream signaling cascade involving spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2). In addition, this pathway was activated independently of the actions of omega-1 (ω-1), a previously described Th2-priming glycoprotein present in SEA. These findings were supported by in vivo murine data showing that ω-1–independent Th2 priming by SEA was mediated by Dectin-2 and Syk signaling in DCs. Finally, we found that Dectin-2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;, and to a lesser extent Dectin-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, displayed impaired Th2 responses and reduced egg-driven granuloma formation following &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; infection, highlighting the physiological importance of this pathway in Th2 polarization during a helminth infection. In summary, we identified a novel pathway in DCs involving Dectin-1/2-Syk-PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OX40L through which Th2 immune responses are induced.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JxCwEstI3Wg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Dectin-1/2–induced autocrine PGE&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; signaling licenses dendritic cells to prime Th2 responses</title><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005504</link><recrawled>1524078544053</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005504</originId><engagementRate>0.22</engagementRate><fingerprint>4fb82e6d</fingerprint><author><name>Maria M.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the range, nature, and extent of current research activity exploring the influence of innovative health-related technologies on social inequalities in health, with specific focus on a deeper understanding of the variables used to measure this connection and the pathways leading to the (re)production of inequalities. A review process was conducted, based on scoping review techniques, searching literature published from January 1, 1996 to November 25, 2016 using MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Search, sorting, and data extraction processes were conducted by a team of researchers and experts using a dynamic, reflexive examination process. Of 4139 studies collected from the search process, a total of 33 were included in the final analysis. Results of this study include the classification of technologies based on how these technologies are accessed and used by end users. In addition to the factors and mechanisms that influence unequal &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to technologies, the results of this study highlight the importance of variations in &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; that importantly shape social inequalities in health. Additionally, focus on health care services technologies must be accompanied by investigating emerging technologies influencing healthy lifestyle, genomics, and personalized devices in health. Findings also suggest that choosing one measure of social position over another has important implications for the interpretation of research results. Furthermore, understanding the pathways through which various innovative health technologies reduce or (re)produce social inequalities in health is context dependent. In order to better understand social inequalities in health, these contextual variations draw attention to the need for critical distinctions between technologies based on how these various technologies are accessed and used. The results of this study provide a comprehensive starting point for future research to further investigate how innovative technologies may influence the unequal distribution of health as a human right.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Innovative technologies and social inequalities in health: A scoping review of the literature</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195447</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195447</originId><fingerprint>a655d99</fingerprint><author><name>Daniel Weiss</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195447</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522789200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f72:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Weiss, Håvard T.

Phycobilisomes (PBS) are accessory light harvesting protein complexes formed mainly by phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The PBPs absorb light that is efficiently transferred to Photosystems due to chromophores covalently bound to specific cysteine residues. Besides phycobiliproteins (PE), the PBS contains linker proteins responsible for assembly and stabilization of the whole complex and the tuning of energy transfer steps between chromophores. The linker (γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria chilensis&lt;/i&gt;, is a chromophorylated rod linker associated to (αβ)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; hexamers of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE). Its role in the energy transfer process is not clear yet. Structural studies as well as the composition and location of the chromophores are essential to understand their involvement in the energy transfer process in PBS. To achieve this, the coding gene of γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was analyzed by informatics tools, to obtain preliminary information which leaded the next experiments. The protein was purified from R-phycoerythrin, and the sequence confirmed by mass spectrometry. The coding sequence analysis revealed a protein of 318 aminoacid residues containing a chloroplastidial transit peptide (cTP) of 39 aminoacids at the N-terminus. The conservation of cysteines revealed possible chromophorylation sites. Using α and β R-PE subunits as spectroscopic probes in denaturation assays, we deduced a double bonded phycourobilin (PUB) on γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; subunit that were confirmed between Cys62 and Cys73 (DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;62/73&lt;/sup&gt;) by mass spectrometry. The cysteines involved in the double link are located in a helical region, in a conformation that reminds the position of the DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;50/61&lt;/sup&gt; in the β subunit of R-PE. The position of single linked PUB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt; and a single linked PEB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; were also confirmed.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of infection and poorer responses to vaccination. This suggests that CKD patients have an impaired responsiveness to all antigens, even those first encountered before CKD onset. To examine this we evaluated antibody responses against two childhood vaccine antigens, tetanus (TT) and diphtheria toxoids (DT) and two common pathogens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Enteritidis (SEn) in two independent cohorts consisting of age-matched individuals with and without CKD. Sera were evaluated for antigen-specific IgG titres and the functionality of antibody to SEn was assessed in a serum bactericidal assay. Surprisingly, patients with CKD and control subjects had comparable levels of IgG against TT and DT, suggesting preserved humoral memory responses to antigens encountered early in life. Lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG titres and serum bactericidal activity in patients with CKD were also not inferior to controls. CMV-specific IgG titres in seropositive CKD patients were similar or even increased compared to controls. Therefore, whilst responses to new vaccines in CKD are typically lower than expected, antibody responses to antigens commonly encountered prior to CKD onset are not. The immunodeficiency of CKD is likely characterised by failure to respond to new antigenic challenges and efforts to improve patient outcomes should be focussed here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Humoral immunity to memory antigens and pathogens is maintained in patients with chronic kidney disease</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</originId><fingerprint>939ee3f</fingerprint><author><name>Nadezhda A.

Sera were evaluated for antigen-specific IgG titres and the functionality of antibody to SEn was assessed in a serum bactericidal assay. Surprisingly, patients with CKD and control subjects had comparable levels of IgG against TT and DT, suggesting preserved humoral memory responses to antigens encountered early in life. Lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG titres and serum bactericidal activity in patients with CKD were also not inferior to controls. CMV-specific IgG titres in seropositive CKD patients were similar or even increased compared to controls. Therefore, whilst responses to new vaccines in CKD are typically lower than expected, antibody responses to antigens commonly encountered prior to CKD onset are not. The immunodeficiency of CKD is likely characterised by failure to respond to new antigenic challenges and efforts to improve patient outcomes should be focussed here.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523912400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled></item><item><content><content>Assembly of light-harvesting complexes requires synchronization of chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis with biogenesis of light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding proteins (LHCPs).

We investigated how visual and kinaesthetic/efferent information is integrated for speed perception in running. Twelve moderately trained to trained subjects ran on a treadmill at three different speeds (8, 10, 12 km/h) in front of a moving virtual scene. They were asked to match the visual speed of the scene to their running speed–i.e., treadmill’s speed. For each trial, participants indicated whether the scene was moving slower or faster than they were running. Visual speed was adjusted according to their response using a staircase until the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) was reached, i.e., until visual and running speed were perceived as equivalent. For all three running speeds, participants systematically underestimated the visual speed relative to their actual running speed. Indeed, the speed of the visual scene had to exceed the actual running speed in order to be perceived as equivalent to the treadmill speed. The underestimation of visual speed was speed-dependent, and percentage of underestimation relative to running speed ranged from 15% at 8km/h to 31% at 12km/h. We suggest that this fact should be taken into consideration to improve the design of attractive treadmill-mediated virtual environments enhancing engagement into physical activity for healthier lifestyles and disease prevention and care.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Matching optical flow to motor speed in virtual reality while running on a treadmill</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</originId><fingerprint>7fb183c6</fingerprint><author><name>Martina Caramenti</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523480400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d5:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Caramenti, Claudio L.

The relationship between ABO blood groups (BG) and risk of incidence in cancers including gynecological cancers has been widely studied, showing increased incidence risk for BG A patients. As available data are inconsistent we investigated whether BG and their anti-glycan antibodies (anti-A and anti-B) have prognostic values in gynecological cancers. We retrospectively evaluated 974 patients with gynecological cancers in three cancer centers (Switzerland and Australia) between 1974 and 2014 regarding the relationships between clinico-pathological findings and the BG. Time to disease recurrence was significantly influenced by BG in patients with ovarian (n = 282) and vulvar (n = 67) cancer. BG O or B patients showed a significantly increased risk for ovarian cancer relapse compared to A, 59% and 82%, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.045; HR O vs A = 1.59 (CI 1.01–2.51) and (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036; HR A vs B = 0.55 (CI 0.32–0.96). Median time to relapse for advanced stage (n = 126) ovarian cancer patients was 18.2 months for BG O and 32.2 for A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031; HR O vs A = 2.07 (CI 1.07–4.02)). BG also significantly influenced relapse-free survival in patients with vulvar cancer (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), with BG O tending to have increased relapse risk compared to A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.089). Blood groups hence associate with recurrence in ovarian and vulvar cancer: women with BG O seem to have a lower ovarian cancer incidence, however are more likely to relapse earlier. The significance of the BG status as a prognostic value is evident and may be helpful to oncologists in prognosticating disease outcome and selecting the appropriate therapy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>ABO blood groups as a prognostic factor for recurrence in ovarian and vulvar cancer</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</originId><fingerprint>985d93ea</fingerprint><author><name>Céline Montavon Sartorius</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde28:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Céline Montavon Sartorius, Andreas Schoetzau, Henriette Kettelhack, Daniel Fink, Neville F.

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hb&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA or protein.

Identity-based proxy re-signature (IDPRS) is a novel cryptographic primitive that allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a signature under one identity into another signature under another identity on the same message by using a re-signature key. Due to this transformation function, IDPRS is very useful in constructing privacy-preserving schemes for various information systems. Key revocation functionality is important in practical IDPRS for managing users dynamically; however, the existing IDPRS schemes do not provide revocation mechanisms that allow the removal of misbehaving or compromised users from the system. In this paper, we first introduce a notion called revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (RIDPRS) to achieve the revocation functionality. We provide a formal definition of RIDPRS as well as its security model. Then, we present a concrete RIDPRS scheme that can resist signing key exposure and prove that the proposed scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen identity and message attacks in the standard model. To further improve the performance of signature verification in RIDPRS, we introduce a notion called server-aided revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (SA-RIDPRS). Moreover, we extend the proposed RIDPRS scheme to the SA-RIDPRS scheme and prove that this extended scheme is secure against adaptive chosen message and collusion attacks. The analysis results show that our two schemes remain efficient in terms of computational complexity when implementing user revocation procedures. In particular, in the SA-RIDPRS scheme, the verifier needs to perform only a bilinear pairing and four exponentiation operations to verify the validity of the signature. Compared with other IDPRS schemes in the standard model, our SA-RIDPRS scheme greatly reduces the computation overhead of verification.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Revocable identity-based proxy re-signature against signing key exposure</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194783</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194783</originId><fingerprint>e3d68030</fingerprint><author><name>Xiaodong Yang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194783</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5fa:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaodong Yang, Chunlin Chen, Tingchun Ma, Jinli Wang, Caifen Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Aluminum phosphide (AlP) is used as pesticide in some countries for protection of stored grains. Human poisoning with AlP due to suicide attempt or accidental environmental exposure is associated with very high mortality partially due to development of severe metabolic acidosis. Previous studies have shown that hemoglobin has high buffering capacity and erythrocytes can potentially be used for management of metabolic acidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fresh packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion on survival and cardiovascular function in AlP-poisoned rats.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Rats were poisoned with AlP by gavage. Fresh packed RBC was transfused via tail vein after AlP administration. Acid-base balance, vital signs and mortality was assessed and compared in experimental groups. Infusion of fresh packed RBC (1.5 ml) one hour after AlP (4–15 mg/kg) intoxication was associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate.

Background &lt;p&gt;Aluminum phosphide (AlP) is used as pesticide in some countries for protection of stored grains. Human poisoning with AlP due to suicide attempt or accidental environmental exposure is associated with very high mortality partially due to development of severe metabolic acidosis. Previous studies have shown that hemoglobin has high buffering capacity and erythrocytes can potentially be used for management of metabolic acidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fresh packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion on survival and cardiovascular function in AlP-poisoned rats.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Rats were poisoned with AlP by gavage. Fresh packed RBC was transfused via tail vein after AlP administration. Acid-base balance, vital signs and mortality was assessed and compared in experimental groups. Infusion of fresh packed RBC (1.5 ml) one hour after AlP (4–15 mg/kg) intoxication was associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate. Packed RBC infusion improved blood pH, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. Plasma troponin level was also reduced and ECG changes were reversed following packed RBC infusion in AlP intoxicated rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our results showed that fresh RBC transfusion could ameliorate metabolic acidosis and enhance survival in AlP-poisoned rat.

Background &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a highly sensitive test for TB diagnosis, but still costly to most low-income countries. Several implementation strategies instead of frontline have been suggested; however with scarce data. We assessed accuracy of different Xpert MTB/RIF implementation strategies to inform national roll-out.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study of 1,924 adult presumptive TB patients in five regional referral hospitals of Uganda. Two sputum samples were collected, one for fluorescent microscopy (FM) and Xpert MTB/RIF examined at the study site laboratories. The second sample was sent to the Uganda Supra National TB reference laboratory for culture using both Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) and liquid culture (MGIT). We compared the sensitivities of FM, Xpert MTB/RIF and the incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF among patients negative on FM using LJ and/or MGIT as a reference standard.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total 1924 patients were enrolled of which 1596 (83%) patients had at least one laboratory result and 1083 respondents had a complete set of all the laboratory results. A total of 328 (30%) were TB positive on LJ and /or MGIT culture. The sensitivity of FM was n (%; 95% confidence interval) 246 (63.5%; 57.9–68.7) overall compared to 52 (55.4%; 44.1–66.3) among HIV positive individuals, while the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 300 (76.2%; 71.7–80.7) and 69 (71.6%; 60.5–81.1) overall and among HIV positive individuals respectively. Overall incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 60 (36.5%; 27.7–46.0) and 20 (41.7%; 25.5–59.2) among HIV positive individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF has a higher sensitivity than FM both in general population and HIV positive population. Xpert MTB/RIF offers a significant increase in terms of diagnostic sensitivity even when it is deployed selectively i.e. among smear negative presumptive TB patients. Our results support frontline use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in high HIV/TB prevalent countries.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming increasingly integrated into oncological practice and clinical research. NGS methods have also provided evidence for clonal evolution of cancers during disease progression and treatment. The number of variants associated with response to specific therapeutic agents keeps increasing. However, the identification of novel driver mutations as opposed to passenger (phenotypically silent or clinically irrelevant) mutations remains a major challenge. We conducted targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors from 44 pre-treated patients with solid tumors including breast, colorectal and lung carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas and others. We catalogued established driver mutations and putative new drivers as predicted by two distinct algorithms. The established drivers we detected were consistent with published observations. However, we also detected a significant number of mutations with driver potential never described before in each tumor type we studied. These putative drivers belong to key cell fate regulatory networks, including potentially druggable pathways. Should our observations be confirmed, they would support the hypothesis that new driver mutations are selected by treatment in clinically aggressive tumors, and indicate a need for longitudinal genomic testing of solid tumors to inform second line cancer treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Novel putative drivers revealed by targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194790</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194790</originId><fingerprint>a1491f56</fingerprint><author><name>Antonio Pannuti</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194790</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521838800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d3:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Pannuti, Aleksandra Filipovic, Chindo Hicks, Elliot Lefkowitz, Travis Ptacek, Justin Stebbing, Lucio Miele&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication. Participants were sampled purposefully and taking through in-depth interviews using an interview guide. Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability.

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication. Participants were sampled purposefully and taking through in-depth interviews using an interview guide. Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability. Other factors identified to influence non-adherence included polypharmacy practice; tight work schedules; social norms; poor prescription instruction by health providers; and knowledge and experience of medication.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Findings suggests the need for health providers to adopt therapeutic approaches that take into account patients’ beliefs, values and norms in administering medications. Sensitisation of patients and caregivers during admission on the implication of non-adherence, as well as interventions that monitor and provide feedback mechanisms on patients’ medication taking behaviour holds promise for maximising diabetes and hypertensive medication adherence.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193995</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Valerie J.

&lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia chaffeensis&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, secretes several effector proteins that bind host DNA to modulate host gene expression. The tandem repeat protein 120 (TRP120), one of the largest effector proteins, has four nearly identical tandem repeat (TR) regions that each consists of 80 amino acids. In addition to playing a role in ehrlichial binding and internalization, TRP120 translocates to the host nucleus where it is thought to function as a transcription factor that modulates gene expression. However, sequence analysis of TRP120 does not identify the presence of DNA-binding or trans-activation domains typical of classical eukaryotic transcription factors. Thus, the mechanism by which TRP120 binds DNA and modulates gene expression remains elusive. Herein, we expressed the TR regions of the TRP120 protein, and characterized its solution structure and ability to bind DNA. TRP120, expressed as either a one or two TR repeat, is a monomer in solution, and is mostly disordered as determined by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Using NMR spectroscopy, we further show that the 1 TR construct selectively binds GC-rich DNA. Although low pH was required for TRP120 TR-DNA interaction, acidic pH alone does not induce any significant structural changes in the TR region. This suggests that TRP120 folds into an ordered structure upon forming a protein-DNA complex, and thus folding of TRP120 TR is coupled with DNA binding.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia chaffeensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; TRP120 nucleomodulin binds DNA with disordered tandem repeat domain</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194891</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194891</originId><fingerprint>e8729ac</fingerprint><author><name>Valerie J.

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Effect of ENSO events on larval and juvenile duration and transport of Japanese eel (&amp;lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195544</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195544</originId><fingerprint>2467dea2</fingerprint><author><name>Kuan-Mei Hsiung</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195544</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523394000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b3:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of built-up areas for a wide range of applications. Recently developed approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of built-up areas using road network data. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard to different administrative regions and cities/towns.

Virus-mediated expression of defined transcription factor (TF) genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming. However, sustained expression of the TFs often hinders pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation into specific cell types, as each TF exerts its effect on PSCs for a defined period of time during differentiation. Here, we applied a bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS)-based protein delivery tool to directly translocate TFs in the form of protein into human PSCs. This transient protein delivery technique showed high delivery efficiency for hPSCs, and it avoids potential genetic alterations caused by the introduction of transgenes. In an established cardiomyocyte &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; differentiation procedure, five transcriptional factors, namely GATA4, MEF2C, TBX5, ESRRG and MESP1 (abbreviated as GMTEM), were translocated at various time points. By detecting the expression of cardiac marker genes (&lt;i&gt;Nkx2&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cTnT&lt;/i&gt;), we found that GMTEM proteins delivered on mesoderm stage of the cardiomyocytes lineage differentiation significantly enhanced both the human ESC and iPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes, while earlier or later delivery diminished the enhancing effect. Furthermore, all of the five factors were required to enhance the cardiac differentiation. This work provides a virus-free strategy of transient transcription factors delivery for directing human stem cell fate without jeopardizing genome integrity, thus safe for biomedical applications.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Enhanced differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes by bacteria-mediated transcription factors delivery</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194895</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194895</originId><fingerprint>aec240da</fingerprint><author><name>Yongxin Jin</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194895</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf604:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yongxin Jin, Ying Liu, Zhenpeng Li, Katherine Santostefano, Jing Shi, Xinwen Zhang, Donghai Wu, Zhihui Cheng, Weihui Wu, Naohiro Terada, Shouguang Jin, Fang Bai&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 (-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651).

Background &lt;p&gt;The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo.

The ecology of Lyme borreliosis is complex in northwestern California, with several potential reservoir hosts, tick vectors, and genospecies of &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato. The primary objective of this study was to determine the fine-scale spatial distribution of different genospecies in four rodent species, the California ground squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Otospermophilus beecheyi&lt;/i&gt;), northern flying squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Glaucomys sabrinus&lt;/i&gt;), dusky-footed woodrat (&lt;i&gt;Neotoma fuscipes&lt;/i&gt;), and Allen’s chipmunk (&lt;i&gt;Neotamias senex&lt;/i&gt;). Rodents were live-trapped between June 2004 and May 2005 at the Hoopa Valley Tribal Reservation (HVTR) in Humboldt County, California. Ear-punch biopsies obtained from each rodent were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. The programs ArcGIS and SaTScan were used to examine the spatial distribution of genospecies. Multinomial log-linear models were used to model habitat and host-specific characteristics and their effect on the presence of each borrelial genospecies. The Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to compare models and determine model fit. &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was primarily associated with chipmunks and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; largely with woodrats. The top model included the variables “host species”, “month”, and “elevation” (weight = 0.84). Spatial clustering of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; was detected in the northwestern section of the HVTR, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was clustered in the southeastern section. We conclude that the spatial distribution of these borreliae are driven at least in part by host species, time-of-year, and elevation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Spatial clustering of &amp;lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&amp;lt;/i&gt; sensu lato within populations of Allen&apos;s chipmunks and dusky-footed woodrats in northwestern California</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195586</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195586</originId><fingerprint>968b65e3</fingerprint><author><name>Gregory M.

We found that -catenin palmitoylation is also instrumental in the development of neuropathic pain. The abundances of palmitoylated -catenin and the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC3 were increased in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons in rat models of neuropathic pain. Inhibiting palmitoyl acyltransferases or decreasing -catenin abundance in the DRG by intrathecal injection of 2-bromopalmitate or shRNA, respectively, alleviated oxaliplatin or nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain in the rats. The palmitoylation of -catenin, which was induced by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, facilitated its interaction with the voltage-gated sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 and the kinesin motor protein KIF3A, which promoted the trafficking of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 to the plasma membrane in DRG neurons and contributed to mechanical hypersensitivity and allodynia in rats. These findings suggest that a palmitoylation-mediated KIF3A/-catenin/Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 complex enhances the transmission of mechanical and nociceptive signals; thus, blocking this mechanism may be therapeutic in patients with neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Palmitoylation of {delta}-catenin promotes kinesin-mediated membrane trafficking of Nav1.6 in sensory neurons to promote neuropathic pain</title><origin><title>Science Signaling current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;Palmitoylation of -catenin is critical to synapse plasticity and memory formation. We found that -catenin palmitoylation is also instrumental in the development of neuropathic pain. The abundances of palmitoylated -catenin and the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC3 were increased in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons in rat models of neuropathic pain.

Multivariate Cox regression models identified that earlier time to aerobic exercise was associated with faster return to sport and school/work adjusting for other covariates, including quintile propensity strata. For each successive day in delay to initiation of aerobic exercise, individuals had a less favourable recovery trajectory. Initiating aerobic exercise at 3 and 7 days following injury was associated with a respective 36.5% (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53–0.76) and 73.2% (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.45) reduced probability of faster full return to sport compared to within 1 day; and a respective 45.9% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44–0.66) and 83.1% (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.30) reduced probability of faster full return to school/work.

The mimetic juveniles of a number of carangid fish species resemble plant parts floating near the water surface, such as leaves, seeds and other plant debris. The present study is the first to verify the morphological similarities and ecomorphological relationships between three carangids (&lt;i&gt;Oligoplites saurus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Oligoplites palometa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trachinotus falcatus&lt;/i&gt;) and their associated plant models. Behavioral observations were conducted in the estuary of Curuçá River, in northeastern Pará (Brazil) between August 2015 and July 2016. Individual fishes and associated floating objects (models) were sampled for comparative analysis using both geometric and morphometric approaches. While the mimetic fish and their models retain their own distinct, intrinsic morphological features, a high degree of morphological similarity was found between each fish species and its model. The morphometric analyses revealed a general tendency of isometric development in all three fish species, probably related to their pelagic habitats, during all ontogenetic stages.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Scaling mimesis: Morphometric and ecomorphological similarities in three sympatric plant-mimetic fish of the family Carangidae (Teleostei)</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194437</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194437</originId><fingerprint>14d8416f</fingerprint><author><name>Alexya Cunha de Queiroz</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194437</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521579600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37a8:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexya Cunha de Queiroz, Marcelo Vallinoto, Yoichi Sakai, Tommaso Giarrizzo, Breno Barros&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with endplate degeneration and the association between cartilaginous fragments and inflammatory response to the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Summary of background data &lt;p&gt;LDH often involves hyaline cartilage fragments pulled from the vertebral endplates. Modic changes are closely associated with LDH that contains hyaline cartilage, and cartilaginous endplates seem to affect resorption of the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 78 patients who underwent microscopic discectomy between 9 and 16 weeks after an occurrence of LDH were reviewed. Modic changes, disc degeneration, high-intensity zone, and vertebral corner defect were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histopathological observations of cartilaginous endplates and inflamed granulation tissue in the herniated disc were made. In cases with inflamed granulation tissue, neovascularization and macrophage infiltration were also evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Modic changes were observed in approximately one-third of the patients (26 cases: type 1, 7; type 2, 17; and type 3, 2). Cartilaginous endplates were observed in 32 cases (41%) and in the majority of cases with Modic changes compared with cases without Modic changes (65%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). Although inflamed granulation tissue was observed in 60 cases (77%), no significant differences were detected in patient age and the composition of the herniated material. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that fewer CD34-positive capillaries and CD68-positive cells were found in cases with cartilaginous fragments compared with those without cartilaginous fragments (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In addition, a higher immunoreactivity to CD34 and CD68 was found in herniated discs &amp;lt;25% of whose area was occupied by cartilaginous endplates compared with discs whose area was occupied at 25% or more (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;There is an association between LDH with endplate degeneration and cartilaginous herniation, with Modic type 2 predominating.

Drones are being increasingly used in innovative ways to enhance environmental research and conservation. Despite their widespread use for wildlife studies, there are few scientifically justified guidelines that provide minimum distances at which wildlife can be approached to minimize visual and auditory disturbance. These distances are essential to ensure that behavioral and survey data have no observer bias and form the basis of requirements for animal ethics and scientific permit approvals. In the present study, we documented the behaviors of three species of sea turtle (green turtles, &lt;i&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/i&gt;, flatback turtles, &lt;i&gt;Natator depressus&lt;/i&gt;, hawksbill turtles, &lt;i&gt;Eretmochelys imbricata&lt;/i&gt;), saltwater crocodiles (&lt;i&gt;Crocodylus porosus)&lt;/i&gt;, and crested terns (&lt;i&gt;Thalasseus bergii&lt;/i&gt;) in response to a small commercially available (1.4 kg) multirotor drone flown in Northern Territory and Western Australia. Sea turtles in nearshore waters off nesting beaches or in foraging habitats exhibited no evasive behaviors (e.g. rapid diving) in response to the drone at or above 20–30 m altitude, and at or above 10 m altitude for juvenile green and hawksbill turtles foraging on shallow, algae-covered reefs. Adult female flatback sea turtles were not deterred by drones flying forward or stationary at 10 m altitude when crawling up the beach to nest or digging a body pit or egg chamber. In contrast, flyovers elicited a range of behaviors from crocodiles, including minor, lateral head movements, fleeing, or complete submergence when a drone was present below 50 m altitude. Similarly, a colony of crested terns resting on a sand-bank displayed disturbance behaviors (e.g. flight response) when a drone was flown below 60 m altitude. The current study demonstrates a variety of behavioral disturbance thresholds for diverse species and should be considered when establishing operating conditions for drones in behavioral and conservation studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Measuring behavioral responses of sea turtles, saltwater crocodiles, and crested terns to drone disturbance to define ethical operating thresholds</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194460</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194460</originId><fingerprint>fe047054</fingerprint><author><name>Elizabeth Bevan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194460</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521666000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087ea:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Bevan, Scott Whiting, Tony Tucker, Michael Guinea, Andrew Raith, Ryan Douglas&lt;/p&gt;
Drones are being increasingly used in innovative ways to enhance environmental research and conservation. Despite their widespread use for wildlife studies, there are few scientifically justified guidelines that provide minimum distances at which wildlife can be approached to minimize visual and auditory disturbance. These distances are essential to ensure that behavioral and survey data have no observer bias and form the basis of requirements for animal ethics and scientific permit approvals. In the present study, we documented the behaviors of three species of sea turtle (green turtles, &lt;i&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/i&gt;, flatback turtles, &lt;i&gt;Natator depressus&lt;/i&gt;, hawksbill turtles, &lt;i&gt;Eretmochelys imbricata&lt;/i&gt;), saltwater crocodiles (&lt;i&gt;Crocodylus porosus)&lt;/i&gt;, and crested terns (&lt;i&gt;Thalasseus bergii&lt;/i&gt;) in response to a small commercially available (1.4 kg) multirotor drone flown in Northern Territory and Western Australia. Sea turtles in nearshore waters off nesting beaches or in foraging habitats exhibited no evasive behaviors (e.g. rapid diving) in response to the drone at or above 20–30 m altitude, and at or above 10 m altitude for juvenile green and hawksbill turtles foraging on shallow, algae-covered reefs. Adult female flatback sea turtles were not deterred by drones flying forward or stationary at 10 m altitude when crawling up the beach to nest or digging a body pit or egg chamber. In contrast, flyovers elicited a range of behaviors from crocodiles, including minor, lateral head movements, fleeing, or complete submergence when a drone was present below 50 m altitude. Similarly, a colony of crested terns resting on a sand-bank displayed disturbance behaviors (e.g. flight response) when a drone was flown below 60 m altitude. The current study demonstrates a variety of behavioral disturbance thresholds for diverse species and should be considered when establishing operating conditions for drones in behavioral and conservation studies.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194460</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521654130464</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;ROS1 inhibition in E-cadherin–deficient tumors leads to synthetic lethality, which could be exploited for the selective treatment of breast cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>[Editors&apos; Choice] A (synthetic) lethal weapon for cancer</title><origin><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;ROS1 inhibition in E-cadherin–deficient tumors leads to synthetic lethality, which could be exploited for the selective treatment of breast cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/437/eaat4477?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>7184314f</fingerprint><author><name>Lujambio, A.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/437/eaat4477?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524073687000</published><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_162d9f425c6:3bd58ce:7d6c1c1c</id><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/437/eaat4477.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/437/eaat4477?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1524075079110</crawled></item><item><title>Even more genes control cell growth</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/281-g?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>f252693f</fingerprint><author><name>Ray, L.

Mimicry can occur in several contexts, including sexual interactions. In some cases, males mimic females to gain access to potential mates. In contrast, there are relatively few examples of species where females mimic males, and we know very little about what drives these patterns. Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain female mimicry of males. The first is that mimicry is used to reduce harassment of females by males. The second is that mimicry is used to display dominance over other females. In this study, we tested these hypotheses in &lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&lt;/i&gt; fishes, wherein females of several species have pigmentation on their anal fin of the same coloration and shape, and in the same location, as the genitalia of males. To test if female mimicry of males reduces male harassment, we experimentally manipulated female pigmentation and observed male preference for females with and without male-like pigmentation. To test the effect that female mimicry of males has on female dominance, we observed how females respond to anal fin pigmentation patterns of companion females. We found that neither of these hypotheses was supported by our data. We conclude that similarities in anal fin pigmentation between male and female &lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&lt;/i&gt; fishes is not an adaptation to reduce male harassment or to signal dominance between females. Alternative explanations must exist, including the possibility that these similarities are simply non-adaptive.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Anal fin pigmentation in &amp;lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&amp;lt;/i&gt; fishes is not used for sexual mimicry</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194121</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194121</originId><fingerprint>410901e9</fingerprint><author><name>Kandace M.

Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear. In sparse rat hippocampal microcultures, neurons were surprisingly resilient to 16 h glucose removal in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity. Neuronal survival and synaptic transmission were unaffected by prolonged removal of exogenous glucose. Inhibition of lactate transport decreased microculture neuronal survival during concurrent glucose deprivation, suggesting that endogenously released lactate is important for tolerance to glucose deprivation. Tandem depolarization and glucose deprivation also reduced neuronal survival, and trace glucose concentrations afforded neuroprotection. Mass cultures, in contrast to microcultures, were insensitive to depolarizing glucose deprivation, a difference attributable to increased extracellular lactate levels. Removal of local astrocyte support did not reduce survival in response to glucose deprivation or alter evoked excitatory transmission, suggesting that on-demand, local lactate shuttling is not necessary for neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose removal. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenously produced lactate available globally in the extracellular milieu sustains neurons in the absence of glucose. A better understanding of resilience mechanisms in reduced preparations could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed to bolster these mechanisms in vulnerable neuronal populations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Ambient but not local lactate underlies neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose deprivation</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195520</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195520</originId><fingerprint>7698fc0</fingerprint><author><name>Courtney Sobieski</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195520</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522875600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec8:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Courtney Sobieski, Natasha Warikoo, Hong-Jin Shu, Steven Mennerick&lt;/p&gt;

Numerous factors affect how people choose a fine dining restaurant, including food quality, service quality, food safety, and hedonic value. A conceptual framework for evaluating restaurant selection behavior has not yet been developed. This study surveyed 150 individuals with fine dining experience and proposed the use of mental accounting and axiomatic design to construct a consumer economic behavior model. Linear and logistic regressions were employed to determine model correlations and the probability of each factor affecting behavior. The most crucial factor was food quality, followed by service and dining motivation, particularly regarding family dining. Safe ingredients, high cooking standards, and menu innovation all increased the likelihood of consumers choosing fine dining restaurants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Constructing a consumption model of fine dining from the perspective of behavioral economics</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194886</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194886</originId><fingerprint>773d0fd3</fingerprint><author><name>Sheng-Hsun Hsu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194886</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523480400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd7d:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sheng-Hsun Hsu, Cheng-Fu Hsiao, Sang-Bing Tsai&lt;/p&gt;

Prefrontal anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a potential approach to improve inhibitory control performance. The functional consequences of tDCS during inhibition tasks remain, however, largely unresolved. We addressed this question by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded while participants completed a Go/NoGo task after right-lateralized prefrontal anodal tDCS with a crossover, sham-controlled, double-blind experimental design. We replicated previous evidence for an absence of offline effect of anodal stimulation on Go/NoGo performance. The fMRI results revealed a larger increase in right ventrolateral prefrontal activity for Go than NoGo trials in the anodal than sham condition. This pattern suggests that tDCS-induced increases in cortical excitability have larger effects on fMRI activity in regions with a lower task-related engagement. This was the case for the right prefrontal cortex in the Go condition in our task because while reactive inhibition was not engaged during execution trials, the unpredictability of the demand for inhibitory control still incited an engagement of proactive inhibition. Exploratory analyses further revealed that right prefrontal stimulation interacted with task-related functional demands in the supplementary motor area and the thalamus. Our collective results emphasize the dependency of offline tDCS functional effects on the task-related engagement of the stimulated areas and suggest that this factor might partly account for the discrepancies in the functional effects of tDCS observed in previous studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Modulation of inhibitory control by prefrontal anodal tDCS: A crossover double-blind sham-controlled fMRI study</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194936</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194936</originId><fingerprint>938d6bdc</fingerprint><author><name>Etienne Sallard</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194936</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424c:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Etienne Sallard, Michael Mouthon, Michael De Pretto, Lucas Spierer&lt;/p&gt;

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children &amp;lt;5years and adults &gt;65 years (2004–2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Increased carriage of non-vaccine serotypes with low invasive disease potential four years after switching to the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in The Netherlands</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194823</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194823</originId><fingerprint>590fb747</fingerprint><author><name>Marloes Vissers</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194823</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522443600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c4a:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marloes Vissers, Alienke J.

The results of our recent study on mathematical modeling of microbial genome evolution indicate that, on average, genomes of bacteria and archaea evolve in the regime of mutation-selection balance defined by positive selection coefficients associated with gene acquisition that is counter-acted by the intrinsic deletion bias. This analysis was based on the strong assumption that parameters of genome evolution are universal across the diversity of bacteria and archaea, and yielded extremely low values of the selection coefficient. Here we further refine the modeling approach by taking into account evolutionary factors specific for individual groups of microbes using two independent fitting strategies, an ad hoc hard fitting scheme and a mixture model. The resulting estimate of the mean selection coefficient of &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;∼10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; associated with the gain of one gene implies that, on average, acquisition of a gene is beneficial, and that microbial genomes typically evolve under a weak selection regime that might transition to strong selection in highly abundant organisms with large effective population sizes. The apparent selective pressure towards larger genomes is balanced by the deletion bias, which is estimated to be consistently greater than unity for all analyzed groups of microbes. The estimated values of &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; are more realistic than the lower values obtained previously, indicating that global and group-specific evolutionary factors synergistically affect microbial genome evolution that seems to be driven primarily by adaptation to existence in diverse niches.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Estimation of universal and taxon-specific parameters of prokaryotic genome evolution</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195571</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195571</originId><fingerprint>b6a29edc</fingerprint><author><name>Itamar Sela</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195571</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523653200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793627:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Itamar Sela, Yuri I.

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection. NHBA cleavage may occur at different stages of the infection, and it likely has a different role depending on the environment the bacterium is interacting with.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen is targeted by the human alternative pathway C3-convertase</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194662</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194662</originId><fingerprint>90dfc2a8</fingerprint><author><name>Martina Di Fede</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194662</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f0:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Di Fede, Massimiliano Biagini, Elena Cartocci, Carlo Parillo, Alessandra Greco, Manuele Martinelli, Sara Marchi, Alfredo Pezzicoli, Isabel Delany, Silvia Rossi Paccani&lt;/p&gt;

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system to bimolecular complementation (‘EM split-fluorescent protein’), for localisation of protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrmHIECypRw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Ultrastructural localisation of protein interactions using conditionally stable nanobodies</title><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473</link><recrawled>1522951034312</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473</originId><fingerprint>9519aa11</fingerprint><author><name>Nicholas Ariotti</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/mrmHIECypRw/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e9:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

Context &lt;p&gt;Obese patients are raising specific questions in emergency care such as equipment issues or urgent procedures. Even though obesity prevalence and subsequent health expenditure are increasing worldwide, there is scarce literature about their specific resource utilization of Emergency Departments (ED). These few studies do not take into account both socio-economic situation and comorbidities which are well-known factors influencing healthcare use. Our objective was to assess the emergency care resource utilization of obese individuals (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to normal-weight individuals taking into account comorbidities and social-economic situations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The French CONSTANCES epidemiologic cohort is a randomly selected sample of French adults. Participants data are linked to the National Health Insurance Database collecting all medical acts. The rate of ED visits of obese (and each obesity class) and normal-weight participants were compared considering confounding factors (comorbidities, various socio-economic data). The primary endpoint was to have visited the ED between 2010 and 2013. Sex-separated analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were performed and adjusted odds-ratios [OR] (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 21,035 normal-weight and 5,003 obese participants. Obese participants visited the ED more often than normal-weight participants (men: 30.5% vs. 26.7%; women: 30.3% vs. 24.4%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).

Context &lt;p&gt;Obese patients are raising specific questions in emergency care such as equipment issues or urgent procedures. Even though obesity prevalence and subsequent health expenditure are increasing worldwide, there is scarce literature about their specific resource utilization of Emergency Departments (ED). These few studies do not take into account both socio-economic situation and comorbidities which are well-known factors influencing healthcare use. Our objective was to assess the emergency care resource utilization of obese individuals (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to normal-weight individuals taking into account comorbidities and social-economic situations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The French CONSTANCES epidemiologic cohort is a randomly selected sample of French adults. Participants data are linked to the National Health Insurance Database collecting all medical acts. The rate of ED visits of obese (and each obesity class) and normal-weight participants were compared considering confounding factors (comorbidities, various socio-economic data). The primary endpoint was to have visited the ED between 2010 and 2013. Sex-separated analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were performed and adjusted odds-ratios [OR] (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 21,035 normal-weight and 5,003 obese participants. Obese participants visited the ED more often than normal-weight participants (men: 30.5% vs. 26.7%; women: 30.3% vs. 24.4%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Obese participants presented more comorbidities and a lower socio-economic situation than normal-weight participants. After adjustment, obese participants had a higher risk of visiting ED (men: OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.04–1.33; and women: OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.22–1.52), with a higher risk for class III participants (BMI ≥ 40 kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) (men: OR = 2.18; CI 95%: 1.32–3.63; and women: OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.38–2.49).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Obese individuals have a higher level of emergency care resource utilization than normal-weight individuals and it increases with severe obesity. Further studies are needed to better understand their healthcare pathways leading to EDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194831</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The value of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchial brushing in peripheral non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchial brushing in peripheral non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24300-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24300-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The value of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchial brushing in peripheral non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/zfg8sn3AUy4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The value of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchial brushing in peripheral non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer</title><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The value of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchial brushing in peripheral non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchial brushing in peripheral non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24300-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24300-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The value of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchial brushing in peripheral non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/zfg8sn3AUy4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24300-7</originId><fingerprint>9afb6cb5</fingerprint><author><name>Kai-Lun Yu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/zfg8sn3AUy4/s41598-018-24300-7</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523430000000</published><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b40397a8:43fd69:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24300-7</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24300-7</link><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24300-7/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24300_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>612</height></visual><crawled>1523438557096</crawled></item><item><content><content>We thank Selin (1) for pointing out that in our recent paper (2) on the global biogeochemical cycle of vanadium (V), we misinterpret her calculation of the flux of mercury (Hg) to the atmosphere.

Current approaches for DNA extraction and fragmentation from mammalian spermatozoa provide several challenges for the investigation of the oxidative stress burden carried in the genome of male gametes. Indeed, the potential introduction of oxidative DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species, reducing agents (dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol), and DNA shearing techniques used in the preparation of samples for chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing serve to cofound the reliability and accuracy of the results obtained. Here we report optimised methodology that minimises, or completely eliminates, exposure to DNA damaging compounds during extraction and fragmentation procedures. Specifically, we show that Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion prior to cellular lysis generates a greater DNA yield with minimal collateral oxidation while randomly fragmenting the entire paternal genome. This modified methodology represents a significant improvement over traditional fragmentation achieved via sonication in the preparation of genomic DNA from human spermatozoa for downstream applications, such as next-generation sequencing. We also present a redesigned bioinformatic pipeline framework adjusted to correctly analyse this form of data and detect statistically relevant targets of oxidation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Improved methods of DNA extraction from human spermatozoa that mitigate experimentally-induced oxidative DNA damage</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195003</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195003</originId><fingerprint>3c8ddf1a</fingerprint><author><name>Miguel J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine clinical and ultrasonographic characteristics of male breast tumors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The medical records of male patients with breast lesions were retrieved from an electronic medical record database and a pathology database and retrospectively reviewed. A total of 112 men (125 breast masses) with preoperative breast ultrasonography (US) were included (median age, 59.50 years; age range, 15–96 years). Data extracted included patient age, if the lesions were bilateral, palpable, and tender, and the presence of nipple discharge. Breast lesion features on static US images were reviewed by three experienced radiologists without knowledge of physical examination or pathology results, original breast US image interpretations, or surgical outcomes. The US features were documented according to the BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) US lexicons. A forth radiologist compiled the data for analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 125 breast masses, palpable tender lumps and bilateral synchronous masses were more likely to be benign than malignant (both, 100% vs 0%, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Advanced age and bloody discharge from nipples were common in malignant lesions (P &amp;lt;0.05). A mass eccentric to a nipple, irregular shape, the presence of an echogenic halo, predominantly internal vascularity, and rich color flow signal on color Doppler ultrasound were significantly related to malignancy (all, P &amp;lt; 0.05). An echogenic halo and the presence of rich color flow signal were independent predictors of malignancy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Specific clinical and US characteristics of male breast tumors may help guide treatment, and determine if surgery or conservative treatment is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Clinical and ultrasonographic features of male breast tumors: A retrospective analysis</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194651</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194651</originId><fingerprint>b3999906</fingerprint><author><name>Wei-Hsin Yuan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194651</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521579600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37ba:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei-Hsin Yuan, Anna Fen-Yau Li, Yi-Hong Chou, Hui-Chen Hsu, Ying-Yuan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Natural reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;Yersinia (Y&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; comprise different animal species, but little is known about the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of yersiniosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218). The remaining 18 isolates belonged to bio-serotypes 1B/NI (3/218, 1.4%), 1B/O:8 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/NI (6/218, 2.8%), 2/O:27 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:9 (2/218, 0.9%), 3/NI (2/218, 0.9%), 4/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%) and 4/O:9 (1/218, 0.5%).

Natural reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;Yersinia (Y&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; comprise different animal species, but little is known about the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of yersiniosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218). The remaining 18 isolates belonged to bio-serotypes 1B/NI (3/218, 1.4%), 1B/O:8 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/NI (6/218, 2.8%), 2/O:27 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:9 (2/218, 0.9%), 3/NI (2/218, 0.9%), 4/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%) and 4/O:9 (1/218, 0.5%). The &lt;i&gt;ail&lt;/i&gt; gene, a suggestive virulence gene for &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, has been found in 30 isolates from 20 wild boars, in 6 isolates from red deer, and in 1 isolate from roe deer. Our study demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; is frequently isolated from game animals in Poland, which poses a risk of spreading these infectious agents to other animal species and humans.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195136</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Incidental haptic sensations influence judgment of crimes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidental haptic sensations influence judgment of crimes, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23586-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23586-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Incidental haptic sensations influence judgment of crimes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/KodygdZr7IA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Incidental haptic sensations influence judgment of crimes</title><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Incidental haptic sensations influence judgment of crimes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidental haptic sensations influence judgment of crimes, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23586-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23586-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Incidental haptic sensations influence judgment of crimes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/KodygdZr7IA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23586-x</originId><engagementRate>14.0</engagementRate><fingerprint>77ed1bef</fingerprint><author><name>Michael Schaefer</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/KodygdZr7IA/s41598-018-23586-x</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523862000000</published><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162cdd18230:28c934e:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>42</engagement><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23586-x</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23586-x</link><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23586-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23586_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>430</height></visual><crawled>1523871482416</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;GS9&lt;/i&gt; acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;GS9&amp;lt;/i&gt; acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03616-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03616-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rice grain shape or size is an important trait associated with both yield and appearance quality.

In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of repeated brain metastases (BM) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS2) following local failure of a prior radiosurgical procedure (SRS1). Between December 1996 and August 2015, 30 patients with 36 BM underwent SRS2 with a median dose of 18Gy. All BM were located outside critical structures. Following SRS2, local control at 6 months and one year were respectively 82.9% (IC 95%: 67.6–91.9) and 67.8% (IC 95%: 51–81). On multivariate analysis, planning target volume (PTV) &amp;lt; 3cc (HR: 0.19 (0.1–0.52)) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) prior to SRS2 (HR: 0.25 (0.1–0.64)) were significantly associated with a better local control. One- and two-year overall survival rates after SRS2 were respectively 65.5% (IC 95%: 47.3–80%) and 27.6% (IC 95%: 14.7–45.7). Median overall survival following SRS2 was 14.2 months (range 1–106). Nineteen (63%) patients died from progressive systemic disease. Three (10%) patients died from out-field progressive brain disease and 8 (27%) in-field. Concerning toxicities, edema, radionecrosis, and hemorrhages were identified in 5 (12.8%), 4 (10.2%), and 5 (12.8%) patients respectively. No toxicity resulted in a neurological deficit. On univariate analysis, toxicities were significantly associated with PTV &gt; 7cc (p = 0.02) and all patients had a WBRT before SRS2. A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases showed encouraging rates of local control. This treatment led to acceptable toxicities, especially for brain metastases smaller than 7cc, in our selected cohort of patients with BM located outside critical structures.

Background &lt;p&gt;Data on implications of a high positive titer of serum anti-&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; antibody on gastric cancer (GC) is limited. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of GC with a high serum anti-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; IgG (Hp-IgG) titer, and its association with diffuse-type GC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical and histological characteristics of 917 non-cardia GC patients who underwent gastrectomy. &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection was determined serologically by measuring Hp-IgG titer with immunoassay. Seropositive patients were divided into three groups (low-positive, mid-positive, and high-positive) according to the Hp-IgG titer value. Tumors were classified according to the Lauren criteria as diffuse or intestinal types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median age of the patients was 59.0 years, and 33.8% were female. The patents were grouped as follows: seronegative, 188 (20.5%); low-positive, 288 (31.4%); mid-positive, 290 (31.6%); and high-positive 151 (16.5%). The high-positive group was significantly younger (median age, 55.0 years), with a higher proportion of female (45.0%) and non-smokers (58.9%). The proportion of diffuse-type GC increased in the order low-, mid-, and high-positive groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, the factors associated with diffuse-type GC were younger age, female sex, non-smokers, and a high-positive Hp-IgG titer. Younger age, female sex, and non-smokers remained significant on multivariate analysis whereas the high-positive Hp-IgG titer showed only a tendency toward the association (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.078).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Non-cardia GC patients with a high Hp-IgG titer have distinct clinicopathologic characteristics.

Background &lt;p&gt;Data on implications of a high positive titer of serum anti-&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; antibody on gastric cancer (GC) is limited. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of GC with a high serum anti-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; IgG (Hp-IgG) titer, and its association with diffuse-type GC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical and histological characteristics of 917 non-cardia GC patients who underwent gastrectomy. &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection was determined serologically by measuring Hp-IgG titer with immunoassay.

Experimental philosophy (x-phi) is a young field of research in the intersection of philosophy and psychology. It aims to make progress on philosophical questions by using experimental methods traditionally associated with the psychological and behavioral sciences, such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Motivated by recent discussions about a methodological crisis in the behavioral sciences, questions have been raised about the methodological standards of x-phi. Here, we focus on one aspect of this question, namely the &lt;i&gt;rate of inconsistencies in statistical reporting&lt;/i&gt;. Previous research has examined the extent to which published articles in psychology and other behavioral sciences present statistical inconsistencies in reporting the results of NHST. In this study, we used the R package statcheck to detect statistical inconsistencies in x-phi, and compared rates of inconsistencies in psychology and philosophy. We found that rates of inconsistencies in x-phi are lower than in the psychological and behavioral sciences. From the point of view of statistical reporting consistency, x-phi seems to do no worse, and perhaps even better, than psychological science.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Statistical reporting inconsistencies in experimental philosophy</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194360</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194360</originId><fingerprint>ccf2ae76</fingerprint><author><name>Matteo Colombo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194360</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7129:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Matteo Colombo, Georgi Duev, Michèle B.

Most weakly electric fish navigate and communicate by sensing electric signals generated by their muscle-derived electric organs. Adults of one lineage (Apteronotidae), which discharge their electric organs in excess of 1 kHz, instead have an electric organ derived from the axons of specialized spinal neurons (electromotorneurons [EMNs]). EMNs fire spontaneously and are the fastest-firing neurons known. This biophysically extreme phenotype depends upon a persistent sodium current, the molecular underpinnings of which remain unknown. We show that a skeletal muscle–specific sodium channel gene duplicated in this lineage and, within approximately 2 million years, began expressing in the spinal cord, a novel site of expression for this isoform. Concurrently, amino acid replacements that cause a persistent sodium current accumulated in the regions of the channel underlying inactivation. Therefore, a novel adaptation allowing extreme neuronal firing arose from the duplication, change in expression, and rapid sequence evolution of a muscle-expressing sodium channel gene.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pubkd-zrN1g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Rapid evolution of a voltage-gated sodium channel gene in a lineage of electric fish leads to a persistent sodium current</title><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004892</link><recrawled>1522172523352</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004892</originId><fingerprint>e89ae502</fingerprint><author><name>Ammon Thompson</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/pubkd-zrN1g/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522184400000</published><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162688d21d0:4b9327:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ammon Thompson, Daniel T.

Delivery of recombinant proteins to therapeutic cells is limited by a lack of efficient methods. This hinders the use of transcription factors or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) ribonucleoproteins to develop cell therapies. Here, we report a soluble peptide designed for the direct delivery of proteins to mammalian cells including human stem cells, hard-to-modify primary natural killer (NK) cells, and cancer cell models. This peptide is composed of a 6x histidine-rich domain fused to the endosomolytic peptide CM18 and the cell penetrating peptide PTD4. A less than two-minute co-incubation of 6His-CM18-PTD4 peptide with spCas9 and/or asCpf1 CRISPR ribonucleoproteins achieves robust gene editing. The same procedure, co-incubating with the transcription factor HoxB4, achieves transcriptional regulation. The broad applicability and flexibility of this DNA- and chemical-free method across different cell types, particularly hard-to-transfect cells, opens the way for a direct use of proteins for biomedical research and cell therapy manufacturing.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Membrane permeabilizing amphiphilic peptide delivers recombinant transcription factor and CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 ribonucleoproteins in hard-to-modify cells</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195558</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195558</originId><fingerprint>fcd725d1</fingerprint><author><name>Thomas Del’Guidice</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195558</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522875600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ecb:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Del’Guidice, Jean-Pascal Lepetit-Stoffaes, Louis-Jean Bordeleau, Joannie Roberge, Vanessa Théberge, Coraline Lauvaux, Xavier Barbeau, Jessica Trottier, Vibhuti Dave, Denis-Claude Roy, Bruno Gaillet, Alain Garnier, David Guay&lt;/p&gt;

The results obtained in this study have proven that the plane‐wave basis set first principles calculations under periodic conditions is suitable for accurate prediction of crystal structure and stability. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1520838000000</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162956fcc6f:a3d99ea:9f3b30f2</id><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25198?af=R</link><crawled>1522925554799</crawled></item><item><title>Seeing the clasps that stabilize prion fibrils</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-f?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>45324841</fingerprint><author><name>Vinson, V.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-f?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523554636000</published><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fecec7:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-f?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/167.6.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556775856</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Study on Micropipetting Detection Technology of Automatic Enzyme Immunoassay Analyzer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Study on Micropipetting Detection Technology of Automatic Enzyme Immunoassay Analyzer, Published online: 10 April 2018;

A few colors, such as red and yellow, are commonly found in aposematic (warning) signaling across taxa, independent of evolutionary relationships. These colors have unique traits (i.e., hue, brightness) that aid in their differentiation, and perhaps, their effectiveness in promoting avoidance learning. This repeated use calls into question the influence of selection on specific warning colors adopted by aposematic prey-predator systems. To disentangle the influence of color characteristics on this process, we trained week-old chickens (&lt;i&gt;Gallus gallus domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) to learn to avoid distasteful food that was associated with one of three color signals (yellow, white, red) that varied in both hue and in brightness in order to assess which of these traits most influenced their ability to learn avoidance. Our results show that while chicks learned to avoid all three colors, avoidance was based on the hue, not brightness of the different signals. We found that yellow was the most effective for avoidance learning, followed by red, and finally white. Our results suggest that while these three colors are commonly used in aposematic signaling, predators’ ability to learn avoidance differs among them. These results may explain why yellow is among the most common signals across aposematic taxa.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Avian learning favors colorful, not bright, signals</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194279</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194279</originId><fingerprint>27c86844</fingerprint><author><name>J.

Aims &lt;p&gt;To explore and document the experiences and values of spouse caregivers of stroke survivors. To gain more in-depth knowledge of how the act of caring and the adaption process affects caregiving spouses.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Phenomenological, qualitative study. This study included spouses of stroke survivors who also served as primary caregivers. Individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic content analysis as proposed by Giorgi. Data was analysed and managed using Atlas-ti (version 7.0). This study was approved by our institution´s Complejo Hospitalario de Caceres Ethics and Research Committee.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Spouse caregivers of stroke survivors undergo a process of disruption in their private lives and relationships, marked by their caregiving duties. The experiences of spouses caring for stroke survivors is condensed into topics and subtopics: “&lt;i&gt;Caregiving and that´s all”&lt;/i&gt; summarizes the sense of having no life horizons and also caregiver impossibility of moving away from caring role. Otherwise, “&lt;i&gt;Breaking the couple´s life together”&lt;/i&gt; enlightens the further consequences of stroke in couples shared live biography, which needs to be understood and rebuilt. Finally, “&lt;i&gt;Going through the (non) loss alone”&lt;/i&gt; alludes to how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any acquired global disability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on transition care.

Care resources must be adapted to the interpretation that the spouses have of their caregiving role and their relationship with the different components of the caregiving process.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195190</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Constant strain accumulation rate between major earthquakes on the North Anatolian Fault&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constant strain accumulation rate between major earthquakes on the North Anatolian Fault, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03739-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03739-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Accumulation of interseismic strain may now be constrained by satellite observations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Scuba diver fitness is paramount to confront environmental stressors of diving. However, the diving population is aging and the increasing prevalence of diseases may be a concern for diver fitness.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to assess the demographics, lifestyle factors, disease prevalence, and healthcare access and utilization of Divers Alert Network (DAN) members and compare them with those from the general population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;DAN membership health survey (DMHS) was administered online in 2011 to DAN members in the United States (US). Health status of DMHS respondents was compared with the general US population data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System using two-sided student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests and Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with healthcare utilization among the DMHS participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to the general US population, the DMHS population had lower prevalence of asthma, heart attack, angina, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and disabilities (p&amp;lt;0.01); more heavy alcohol drinkers, and fewer smokers (p&amp;lt;0.01); and greater access and utilization (routine checkup) of healthcare (p&amp;lt;0.01). Healthcare utilization in males was lower than among females. Increasing age and increase in the number of chronic illnesses were associated with increased healthcare utilization.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;DAN members are healthier than the general US population.

Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We approach this problem by measuring the statistical association between having a species having a gene and the probability that the species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation.

Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We approach this problem by measuring the statistical association between having a species having a gene and the probability that the species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation. We show that this phylogenetic correlation indeed leads to many false discoveries and propose phylogenetic linear regression as a powerful solution.

The cost analysis adopted a provider perspective and economic cost per patient successfully treated was calculated based on country protocols and length of treatment per patient per model of care. Logistic regression was used to calculate propensity score weights, to compare pairs of treatment groups, whilst adjusting for baseline imbalances between groups.

Determining and understanding drug target engagement is critical for drug discovery. This can be challenging within living cells as selective readouts are often unavailable. Here we describe a novel method for measuring target engagement in living cells based on the principle of altered protein thermal stabilization / destabilization in response to ligand binding. This assay (HCIF-CETSA) utilizes high content, high throughput single cell immunofluorescent detection to determine target protein levels following heating of adherent cells in a 96 well plate format. We have used target engagement of Chk1 by potent small molecule inhibitors to validate the assay. Target engagement measured by this method was subsequently compared to target engagement measured by two alternative methods (autophosphorylation and CETSA). The HCIF-CETSA method appeared robust and a good correlation in target engagement measured by this method and CETSA for the selective Chk1 inhibitor V158411 was observed. However, these EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were 23- and 12-fold greater than the autophosphorylation IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;.

Determining and understanding drug target engagement is critical for drug discovery. This can be challenging within living cells as selective readouts are often unavailable. Here we describe a novel method for measuring target engagement in living cells based on the principle of altered protein thermal stabilization / destabilization in response to ligand binding. This assay (HCIF-CETSA) utilizes high content, high throughput single cell immunofluorescent detection to determine target protein levels following heating of adherent cells in a 96 well plate format. We have used target engagement of Chk1 by potent small molecule inhibitors to validate the assay. Target engagement measured by this method was subsequently compared to target engagement measured by two alternative methods (autophosphorylation and CETSA). The HCIF-CETSA method appeared robust and a good correlation in target engagement measured by this method and CETSA for the selective Chk1 inhibitor V158411 was observed. However, these EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were 23- and 12-fold greater than the autophosphorylation IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. The described method is therefore a valuable advance in the CETSA method allowing the high throughput determination of target engagement in adherent cells.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195050</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v555/n7698/full/nature25978.html&quot;&gt;yet another paper&lt;/a&gt; on computer-devised retrosynthesis out today – it and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/06/retrosynthesis-here-it-comes&quot;&gt;previous one&lt;/a&gt; make an interesting pair. I have a Nature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03774-5&quot;&gt;“New and Views” comment&lt;/a&gt; on this one (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rdcu.be/KcUV&quot;&gt;free access link&lt;/a&gt;) for a broader audience, but I’ll expand on my thoughts here. &lt;em&gt;(Update: I’m also going on about this on a Nature podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acast.com/nature/29march2018-aiinchemistry-andliquiddropletsinlivingcells-?autoplay=true&amp;seek=49.873266&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the same general thoughts apply to this work as to the last one. What we have, via a team from Münster/BenevolentAI/Shanghai, is another piece of software that has picked up large numbers of possible synthetic transformations and has ways of (1) stringing them together into possible routes and (2) evaluating these against each other to elevate the ones that are deemed more desirable. Naturally, the response from many organic chemists to these things has been “But that’s what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; do”, followed by “Surely no program could do it as well”. The strong form of that latter objection is “Surely no program can do this to any useful extent at all”, and the weak form is “Surely no program can do it for all the molecules that we can”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to dispose of the strong-form objection immediately. Whatever you think of the idea, the programs in the last paper and this one (I’m getting to it!) are generating plausible synthetic routes. You may find them derivative of known ones; you may object that they’re not really any different than something that any competent chemist could have done. &lt;em&gt;But those are already victories for the software.&lt;/em&gt; You might also object, with varying degrees of justification, that the molecules and syntheses chosen are there to show the software in the best light, and that real-world use won’t be as fruitful. But that’s a holding action, even should it have merit: the fact that it can work at all turns the problem, if there is one, into optimizing something that already exists. As the history of chess- and Go-playing software shows, such piecing-together-strategies-and-evaluating-them tasks improve relentlessly once they’ve been shown to work in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That takes us well on the way to disposing of the medium objection, because if the programs aren’t doing this as well as a person can now, well, they will. And that also is an introduction into this new paper. You will have heard over the last two or three years about how Google’s (DeepMind’s) AlphaGo program was able to compete with and them beat the best human players of the game. Go is significantly harder to deal with computationally than chess, so this was a real achievement, and it was done partly by building in every human maneuver and strategy known. But last fall, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new program, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero&quot;&gt;AlphaGo Zero&lt;/a&gt;, that comes at the problem more generally. Instead of having strategies wired into it, the new program is capable of inferring strategies on its own. The software ran hours and hours of Go games and figured out good moves by watching what seemed to work out and what didn’t in various situations, and at the end of the process it beat the latest version of AlphaGo, the one that beats every human on the planet, &lt;em&gt;one hundred games in a row&lt;/em&gt;. It makes moves that no one has yet seen in human play, for reasons that Go experts are now trying to work out. (Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815&quot;&gt;latest iteration&lt;/a&gt;, as far as I know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chematica software I wrote about earlier this month is an example of the AlphaGo style: its makers have spent a great deal of time entering the details of literature reactions into it: this goes to that, but only if there’s not a group like X, and only if the pH doesn’t get a low as Y, etc. Synthetic organic chemists will be familiar with the reactivity tables in the back of the Greene protecting group book – that’s just the sort of thing that was filled out, over and over, and with even more detail. Without this curation, software of this kind tends to generate routes that have obvious “That’s not gonna work” steps in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new paper, though, appears to be in the AlphaGo Zero mode: the program digs through the Reaxys database (all of it) and infers synthetic transformation rules for itself. If this works, it could be a significant advance, because that data curation and entry is a major pain. There are at least two levels to such curation: the first (as mentioned) is capturing all the finer details of what is likely to work (or fail) in the presence of something else. The second goes to the reliability of the synthetic literature in general – you don’t want to feed reactions into the system that haven’t been (or can’t be!) reproduced by others. The way this new program deals with these is pretty straightforward: the first type of curation is handled by brute force processing of Reaxys examples, and the second by a requirement that only transformations that appear independently a certain number of times in the database are allowed into the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic synthesis is a lot harder to reduce to game-type evaluation than chess is, as the authors rightly point out. To get around this, the program combines neural-network processing with a Monte Carlo tree search technique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this work, we combine three different neural networks together with MCTS to perform chemical synthesis planning (3N-MCTS). The first neural network (the expansion policy) guides the search in promising directions by proposing a restricted number of automatically extracted transformations. A second neural network then predicts whether the proposed reactions are actually feasible (in scope). Finally, to estimate the position value, transformations are sampled from a third neural network during the rollout phase. The neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions published in the history of organic chemistry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength of the Chematica paper is that the routes were put to a real-world test at the bench. This new work didn’t go that far, but what the authors did do was have the program generate retrosyntheses for already-synthesized molecules, and then have these routes and the known ones evaluated blind by experienced chemists. The results were a toss-up: the machine routes were considered just as plausible or desirable as the human ones, and that (as above) is a victory for the machine. &lt;em&gt;AI wins ties&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-285x300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-285x300.jpeg 285w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-768x807.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-974x1024.jpeg 974w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-300x315.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route.jpeg 1136w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13412&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At right is an example of a route generated by the 3N-MCTS technique. That’s not a particularly hard molecule to make, but it’s not an artificially easy one, either. That is, in fact, an intermediate in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asianjournalofchemistry.co.in/user/journal/viewarticle.aspx?ArticleID=27_6_39&quot;&gt;published synthesis&lt;/a&gt; of potential 5-HT6 ligands, and the route the program found is identical to the one in the paper, so you can be reasonably sure that it’s valid. You or I would probably come up with something similar – I personally didn’t know that first spirocyclobutane step, but I would have done what the program basically did: look in Reaxys or CAS to see if something like that had been prepared. (Note that the program doesn’t memorize routes, just steps – it pieced this together on its own and declared it good). Note that the program delivered this one in 5.4 seconds, and none of us are going to beat that. Add up the total time we all spend on stuff like this and it starts to look like it’s cutting into other work, you know? If you’d like to see several hundred more schemes along those lines, they’re in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25978#s1&quot;&gt;the paper’s SI files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have two types of retrosynthesis software that (at least in some realistic examples) are if not better than humans, apparently no worse. Where does that put us? And by “us”, I mean “us synthetic chemists”. My conclusions from the earlier paper stand: we are going to have to get used to this, because if the software is not coming to take retrosynthetic planning away from us now, it will do so shortly. You may not care for that – at times, I may not care for it, either – but &lt;em&gt;it doesn’t matter what we think&lt;/em&gt;. If it can do even a decent job of stitching together and evaluating routes, the software will beat us on just general grasp of the literature alone, which some time ago passed beyond the ability of human brains to organize and remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the next step is more-than-decent ability to see and rate synthetic plans. Despite my comparison to AlphaGo Zero (which is valid on mechanistic grounds), it’s not that this new software is coming up with routes that no human would be able to. But if we’re approaching “good as a human”, the next step is always “even better than a human”. Eventually – and not that long from now – such programs are going to go on to generate “Hey, why didn’t I think of that” routes, but you know what? Those of us in the field now are going to be the only ones saying that. The next generation of chemists won’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will have outsourced synthetic planning to the machines. Retrosynthesis will remain a valuable teaching tool, and it will still be the way we think about organic chemistry. It will persist in various forms in the curriculum just as qualitative functional group analyses did, long after they died out in actual practice. Actual practice, meanwhile, will consist of more thinking about what molecules to make and why to make them, and a lot less thinking about “how”. That will only kick in for structures too complex for the software to handle, and that will be a gradually shrinking patch of ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will not go down easy for a lot of us. Thinking about how to make molecules has long been seen as one of the vital parts of organic chemistry, but knowing how to handle horses was long seen as a vital part of raising crops for food, too. It’ll be an adjustment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No memory of having starred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Atones for later disregard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Or keeps the end from being hard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s Robert Frost, and his advice in that poem was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://commonreader.wustl.edu/c/provide-provide/&quot;&gt;Provide, Provide!&lt;/a&gt;” We’ll have to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The Rise of the Rise of the Machines</title><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><description>There’s yet another paper on computer-devised retrosynthesis out today – it and the previous one make an interesting pair.

More than 90% of the cases of Parkinson’s disease have unknown etiology. Gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra is the main cause of morbidity in this disease. External factors such as environmental toxins are believed to play a role in the cell loss, although the cause of the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons remains unknown. We have previously shown that aquaglyceroporin AQP9 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes of rodent brain. AQP9 is permeable to a broad spectrum of substrates including purines, pyrimidines, and lactate, in addition to water and glycerol. Here we test our hypothesis that AQP9 serves as an influx route for exogenous toxins and, hence, may contribute to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) neurons. Using &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes injected with &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; cRNA, we show that AQP9 is permeable to the parkinsonogenic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Stable expression of AQP9 in HEK cells increases their vulnerability to MPP+ and to arsenite—another parkinsonogenic toxin. Conversely, targeted deletion of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; in mice protects nigral dopaminergic neurons against MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity. A protective effect of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; deletion was demonstrated in organotypic slice cultures of mouse midbrain exposed to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in mice subjected to intrastriatal injections of MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Seven days after intrastriatal MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; injections, the population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in substantia nigra is reduced by 48% in &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice compared with 67% in WT littermates. Our results show that AQP9 –selectively expressed in catecholaminergic neurons—is permeable to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and suggest that this aquaglyceroporin contributes to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic neurons by providing an entry route for parkinsonogenic toxins. To our knowledge this is the first evidence implicating a toxin permeable membrane channel in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Targeted deletion of the aquaglyceroporin AQP9 is protective in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194896</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194896</originId><fingerprint>76988caa</fingerprint><author><name>Katja Stahl</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194896</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34c0:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katja Stahl, Soulmaz Rahmani, Agnete Prydz, Nadia Skauli, Nanna MacAulay, Maria N.

We particularly evaluated how dataset x distance measurement combinations performed in 5 PLCs corresponding to 4 well described plant metabolic pathways (phenylpropanoid, carbohydrate, fatty acid and terpene metabolisms) and the cytokinin signaling pathway. Our present work highlights how PCC ranked with HRR is better suited for global network construction and PLC with microarray and RNA-seq data than other distance methods, especially to cluster genes in partitions similar to biological subpathways.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299909v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>e46a2eec</fingerprint><author><name>Liesecke, F.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299909v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523516400000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162baddcc35:f9e1fd:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299909v2?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/12/299909</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523553520693</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NASA reveals major delay for $8-billion Hubble successor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA reveals major delay for $8-billion Hubble successor, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03863-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03863-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Setback for James Webb Space Telescope could have broader effects on agency’s astrophysics programme.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>NASA reveals major delay for $8-billion Hubble successor</title><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NASA reveals major delay for $8-billion Hubble successor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA reveals major delay for $8-billion Hubble successor, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03863-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03863-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Setback for James Webb Space Telescope could have broader effects on agency’s astrophysics programme.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03863-5</originId><fingerprint>e92b8042</fingerprint><author><name>Alexandra Witze</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03863-5</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522134000000</published><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1626819bba1:6361d51:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>1525</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03863-5</link><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03863-5/d41586-018-03863-5_15569220.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1522164939681</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magnetically-driven phase transformation strengthening in high entropy alloys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnetically-driven phase transformation strengthening in high entropy alloys, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03846-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03846-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Medium entropy alloy CoCrNi has better mechanical properties than high entropy alloys such as CrMnFeCoNi, but why that is remains unclear.

Penile acquisition of HIV infection contributes substantially to the global epidemic. Our goal was to establish a preclinical macaque model of penile HIV infection for evaluating the efficacy of new HIV prevention modalities. Rhesus macaques were challenged once or twice weekly with consistent doses of SHIV&lt;sub&gt;sf&lt;/sub&gt;162P3 (a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus containing HIV &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt;) ranging from 4–600 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (50% tissue culture infective dose), via two penile routes, until systemic SHIV infection was confirmed. One route exposed the inner foreskin, glans and urethral os to virus following deposition into the prepuce (foreskin) pouch. The second route introduced the virus non-traumatically into the distal urethra only. Single-route challenges resulted in dose-dependent rates of SHIV acquisition informing selection of optimal SHIV dosing. Concurrent SHIV challenges via the prepuce pouch (200 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and urethra (16 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) resulted in infection of 100% (10/10) animals following a median of 2.5 virus exposures (range, 1–12). We describe the first rhesus macaque repeat-exposure SHIV challenge model of penile HIV acquisition. Utilization of the model should further our understanding of penile HIV infection and facilitate the development of new HIV prevention strategies for men.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Development of a repeat-exposure penile SHIV infection model in macaques to evaluate biomedical preventions against HIV</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194837</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194837</originId><fingerprint>9ac8180e</fingerprint><author><name>David A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Negative workplace behaviour, especially negative communication is a recognised problem in many organisations and is known to have serious impact on workplace performance, productivity and personal wellbeing. Emergency Departments (ED) can be high stress environments in which communication and perceptions of respect between physicians and other staff may underlie individual functioning. We conducted a study to estimate the influence of incivility (ICV) among physicians in the ED.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed an online survey to assess workplace incivility in the ED. We focussed on frequency, origin, reasons and situations where ICV was reported. To measure the levels and the potential influence of ICV on psychological safety, social stress and personal wellbeing we correlated our questionnaire to standard psychological scales. Statistical analysis included Students t-test, chi squared distribution and Pearson correlation coefficient.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We invited all seventy-seven ED physicians to participate in our survey. Among those that completed (n = 50, 65%) the survey, 9% of ED physicians reported frequent (1/week) and 38% occasional (1/month) incidents of ICV. 28% of physicians reported experiencing ICV once per quarter and 21% reported a frequency of only once per year, no physician reported ICV on a daily basis. Levels of ICV were significantly higher in interactions with specialists from outside then within the ED (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).ICV was perceived particularly during critical situations. Our findings showed a significant correlation between internal (within the ED team) ICV and psychological safety. To ED physicians internal ICV was associated with lower levels of psychological safety (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). ICV displayed from sources outside the ED team was not associated with psychological safety, but we found a significant influence of external ICV on personal irritability and reduced wellbeing (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of incivility was high among the ED physicians. Although this was a small sample, the association between workplace ICV and psychological safety, personal irritation as well personal comfort suggests that ICV may be an important variable underlying ED team performance. These findings further underscore the need to foster a culture of respect and good communication between departments, as levels of ICV were highest with physicians from outside the ED. Future research would benefit from examining strategies to prevent and reduce ICV and identify reasons for personal variation in perception of ICV. During critical situations and in general collaboration with specialists, awareness of ICV and countermeasures are important to avoid decreased performance and negative impact on staff and patient.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Bad manners in the Emergency Department: Incivility among doctors</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194933</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194933</originId><fingerprint>9c69324b</fingerprint><author><name>Karsten Klingberg</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194933</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0b:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karsten Klingberg, Khaled Gadelhak, Sabrina N.

The Florida manatee (&lt;i&gt;Trichechus manatus latirotris&lt;/i&gt;) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three G-tetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Identification of G-quadruplex forming sequences in three manatee papillomaviruses</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195625</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195625</originId><fingerprint>e617e4f8</fingerprint><author><name>Maryam Zahin</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195625</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523307600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529e:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maryam Zahin, William L.

Our results on a human aging dataset demonstrate that Tempo identifies novel genes contributing to the progression of Alzheimer&apos;s, Huntington&apos;s and Type II diabetes, while existing methods fail to do so.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303974v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>defa761</fingerprint><author><name>Elhesha, R.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303974v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524034800000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162db0a6fb8:3ef3dd2:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303974v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/303974</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524093317048</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A walk through the approximations of ab initio multiple spawning</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022877?af=R</originId><fingerprint>f873ca0c</fingerprint><author><name>Benoit Mignolet</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022877?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522735260000</published><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b39:7c9981b6</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022877?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523085743269</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Communication: Fast dynamics perspective on the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein law in fragile glassformers</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025614?af=R</originId><fingerprint>da11913e</fingerprint><author><name>F.

The UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (with five dimensions of impulsive behaviour) is being widely used. One of the handicaps of this instrument is its relatively long administration time. This has led to the development of a short version: SUPPS-P. There are no studies comparing the relationship between the SUPPS-P scores and the original UPPS-P scores. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to analyse the psychometric properties, concordance of person measures, and efficiency of the SUPPS-P compared to those on UPPS-P, applying an Item Response Theory Model. The UPPS-P and SUPPS-P were administered to 455 undergraduate students. Confirmatory factorial analysis replicated structures reported in previous studies: the five correlated factors structure and the model with two second-order factors (Urgency and Lack of Awareness) with Sensation Seeking dimension as a different factor. Rasch analysis show that both of the instruments presented adequate model-data fit. The results show the measurement for each dimension of UPPS-P offered more precision than SUPPS-P. The structure of items location was maintained in each dimension of SUPPS-P compared to the UPPS-P, but with better person and item separation indices of the UPPS-P dimensions.

The UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (with five dimensions of impulsive behaviour) is being widely used. One of the handicaps of this instrument is its relatively long administration time. This has led to the development of a short version: SUPPS-P. There are no studies comparing the relationship between the SUPPS-P scores and the original UPPS-P scores. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to analyse the psychometric properties, concordance of person measures, and efficiency of the SUPPS-P compared to those on UPPS-P, applying an Item Response Theory Model. The UPPS-P and SUPPS-P were administered to 455 undergraduate students. Confirmatory factorial analysis replicated structures reported in previous studies: the five correlated factors structure and the model with two second-order factors (Urgency and Lack of Awareness) with Sensation Seeking dimension as a different factor. Rasch analysis show that both of the instruments presented adequate model-data fit. The results show the measurement for each dimension of UPPS-P offered more precision than SUPPS-P. The structure of items location was maintained in each dimension of SUPPS-P compared to the UPPS-P, but with better person and item separation indices of the UPPS-P dimensions. The concordance analysis reveals high correlations values between scores on both versions. From the standpoint of reducing items, it can be considered that the reduced version is more efficient. This study does not support the equivalence of items on the dimensions of Sensation Seeking and Lack of perseverance.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194390</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521654130464</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Air-pollution trackers seek to fill Africa’s data gap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air-pollution trackers seek to fill Africa’s data gap, Published online: 11 April 2018;

Gari, a fermented and dried semolina made from cassava, is one of the most common foods in West Africa. Recently introduced biofortified yellow cassava containing provitamin A carotenoids could help tackle vitamin A deficiency prevalent in those areas. However there are concerns because of the low retention of carotenoids during gari processing compared to other processes (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. boiling). The aim of the study was to assess the levels of true retention in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;–β-carotene during gari processing and investigate the causes of low retention. Influence of processing step, processor (3 commercial processors) and variety (TMS 01/1371; 01/1368 and 01/1412) were assessed. It was shown that low true retention (46% on average) during gari processing may be explained by not only chemical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to roasting temperature) but also by physical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to leaching of carotenoids in discarded liquids): true retention in the liquid lost from grating negatively correlated with true retention retained in the mash (R = -0.914). Moreover, true retention followed the same pattern as lost water at the different processing steps (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. for the commercial processors). Variety had a significant influence on true retention, carotenoid content, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerisation but the processor type had little effect. It is the first time that the importance of physical carotenoid losses was demonstrated during processing of biofortified crops.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Physical losses could partially explain modest carotenoid retention in dried food products from biofortified cassava</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194402</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194402</originId><fingerprint>742e1ead</fingerprint><author><name>Aurélie Bechoff</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194402</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521666000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e7:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aurélie Bechoff, Keith Ian Tomlins, Ugo Chijioke, Paul Ilona, Andrew Westby, Erick Boy&lt;/p&gt;

The 5&apos; RNA cap structure (&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppRNA) is a key feature of eukaryotic mRNAs with important roles in stability, splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA export, and translation. Higher eukaryotes can further modify this minimal cap structure with the addition of a methyl group on the ribose 2&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt; position of the first transcribed nucleotide (&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppN&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;pRNA) and sometimes on the adjoining nucleotide (&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppN&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;pN&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;pRNA). In higher eukaryotes, the DXO protein was previously shown to be responsible for both decapping and degradation of RNA transcripts harboring aberrant 5’ ends such as pRNA, pppRNA, GpppRNA, and surprisingly, &lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppRNA. It was proposed that the interaction of the cap binding complex with the methylated cap would prevent degradation of &lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppRNAs by DXO. However, the critical role of the 2’-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylation found in higher eukaryotic cap structures was not previously addressed. In the present study, we demonstrate that DXO possesses both decapping and exoribonuclease activities toward incompletely capped RNAs, only sparing RNAs with a 2’-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylated cap structure. Fluorescence spectroscopy assays also revealed that the presence of the 2’-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylation on the cap structure drastically reduces the affinity of DXO for RNA. Moreover, immunofluorescence and structure-function assays also revealed that a nuclear localisation signal is located in the amino-terminus region of DXO. Overall, these results are consistent with a quality control mechanism in which DXO degrades incompletely capped RNAs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>2&apos;-&amp;lt;i&gt;O&amp;lt;/i&gt;-methylation of the mRNA cap protects RNAs from decapping and degradation by DXO</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193804</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193804</originId><fingerprint>190975c</fingerprint><author><name>Frédéric Picard-Jean</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193804</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522443600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c42:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frédéric Picard-Jean, Carolin Brand, Maude Tremblay-Létourneau, Andréa Allaire, Maxime C.

L-carnitine is important for the catabolism of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria. We investigated how the triacylglycerol (TAG)-lowering drug 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) influenced lipid metabolism in carnitine-depleted, 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)propionate dehydrate (Mildronate; meldonium)-treated male Wistar rats. As indicated, carnitine biosynthesis was impaired by Mildronate. However, TAG levels of both plasma and liver were decreased by 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated animals. This was accompanied by increased gene expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial activity and proliferation and reduced mRNA levels of &lt;i&gt;Dgat2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ApoB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ApoCIII&lt;/i&gt; in liver. The hepatic energy state was reduced in the group of Mildronate and 1-triple TTA as reflected by increased AMP/ATP ratio, reduced energy charge and induced gene expression of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3. The increase in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was observed despite low plasma carnitine levels, and was linked to strongly induced gene expression of carnitine acetyltransferase, translocase and carnitine transporter, suggesting an efficient carnitine turnover. The present data suggest that the plasma TAG-lowering effect of 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated rats is not only due to increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation reflected by increased mitochondrial biogenesis, but also to changes in plasma clearance and reduced TAG biosynthesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A fatty acid analogue targeting mitochondria exerts a plasma triacylglycerol lowering effect in rats with impaired carnitine biosynthesis</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194978</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194978</originId><fingerprint>e96e7acc</fingerprint><author><name>Carine Lindquist</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194978</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424f:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carine Lindquist, Bodil Bjørndal, Christine Renate Rossmann, Asbjørn Svardal, Seth Hallström, Rolf Kristian Berge&lt;/p&gt;

The present data suggest that the plasma TAG-lowering effect of 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated rats is not only due to increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation reflected by increased mitochondrial biogenesis, but also to changes in plasma clearance and reduced TAG biosynthesis.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194978</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Birgitte Lindegaard, Thine Hvid, Helene Wolsk Mygind, Ole Hartvig Mortensen, Thomas Grøndal, Julie Abildgaard, Jan Gerstoft, Bente Klarlund Pedersen, Marcin Baranowski&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Correction: Low expression of IL-18 and IL-18 receptor in human skeletal muscle is associated with systemic and intramuscular lipid metabolism—Role of HIV lipodystrophy</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196241</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196241</originId><fingerprint>2a6c175b</fingerprint><author><name>Birgitte Lindegaard</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196241</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523998800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344170:7d6c1c1c</id><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196241</canonicalUrl><description>&lt;p&gt;by Birgitte Lindegaard, Thine Hvid, Helene Wolsk Mygind, Ole Hartvig Mortensen, Thomas Grøndal, Julie Abildgaard, Jan Gerstoft, Bente Klarlund Pedersen, Marcin Baranowski&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523998800000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523986744698</crawled></item><item><title>The Cancer Immunotherapy Revolution</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1344?rss=1</originId><memes><item><label>FDA Drugs Patients</label><score>0.5046631347310531</score><id>topic/tech_en/meme/d73942e8-2e15-11e8-8b86-0a580a0c0403</id></item></memes><fingerprint>24c940dc</fingerprint><author><name>Kelly, P.

The main drawback of ranking of researchers by the number of papers, citations or by the Hirsch index is ignoring the problem of distributing authorship among authors in multi-author publications. So far, the single-author or multi-author publications contribute to the publication record of a researcher equally. This full counting scheme is apparently unfair and causes unjust disproportions, in particular, if ranked researchers have distinctly different collaboration profiles. These disproportions are removed by less common fractional or authorship-weighted counting schemes, which can distribute the authorship credit more properly and suppress a tendency to unjustified inflation of co-authors. The urgent need of widely adopting a fair ranking scheme in practise is exemplified by analysing citation profiles of several highly-cited astronomers and astrophysicists. While the full counting scheme often leads to completely incorrect and misleading ranking, the fractional or authorship-weighted schemes are more accurate and applicable to ranking of researchers as well as research teams. In addition, they suppress differences in ranking among scientific disciplines. These more appropriate schemes should urgently be adopted by scientific publication databases as the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) or the Scopus (Elsevier).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Fair ranking of researchers and research teams</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195509</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195509</originId><fingerprint>2ac6a229</fingerprint><author><name>Václav Vavryčuk</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195509</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73b:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Václav Vavryčuk&lt;/p&gt;

Chronic stress is an important factor influencing people’s health. It usually causes endocrinal disorders and a decline in reproduction in females. Although studies of both human and animals suggest a detrimental effect of stress on reproduction, the influence of chronic stress on the ovarian reservation and follicular development is still not clear. In this study, a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of stress on ovarian reservation and follicular development and explore the underlying mechanism. In this study, after 8 weeks of CRS, primordial follicles were excessively activated in the ovaries of the CRS group compared with the control group. Further results showed that the activation of primordial follicles induced by CRS was involved in the increasing expression level of Kit ligand and its receptor Kit and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide released due to stress, which plays an important role in regulating follicle development. A high level of serum CRH was detected in the CRS mouse model, and the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the mRNA level of its main receptor CRHR1increased in the ovaries of the CRS mouse group. Moreover, 100nM CRH significantly improved the activation of primordial follicles in newborn mouse ovaries &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. These results demonstrated that CRS could induce immoderate activation of primordial follicles accompanied by the activation of Kit-PI3K signaling, in which CRH might be an important endocrine factor.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Chronic restraint stress induces excessive activation of primordial follicles in mice ovaries</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194894</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194894</originId><fingerprint>63232578</fingerprint><author><name>Minhua Xu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194894</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522443600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c4c:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Minhua Xu, Junyan Sun, Qian Wang, Qiuwan Zhang, Chunsheng Wei, Dongmei Lai&lt;/p&gt;

We test the hypothesis that prehistoric Native American land use influenced the Euro-American settlement process in a South Carolina Piedmont landscape. Long term ecological studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and trajectories in complex, coupled social and ecological systems. Native American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajectories of many North American landscapes. Yet, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of land use legacies of prehistoric Native Americans. At the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly “wild” landscape or an already “humanized” landscape. We use statistical event analysis to model the effects of prehistoric Native American settlement on the rate of Colonial land grants (1749–1775). Our results reveal how abandoned Native American settlements were among the first areas claimed and homesteaded by Euro-Americans. We suggest that prehistoric land use legacies served as key focal nodes in the Colonial era settlement process. As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Influences of Native American land use on the Colonial Euro-American settlement of the South Carolina Piedmont</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195036</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195036</originId><fingerprint>3d37712b</fingerprint><author><name>Michael R.

The spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity pose a great challenge to accurately estimate the carbon flux in global carbon cycling, which has primarily been researched in flatlands versus hillslope ecosystems. On an eroded slope (35°) of the semiarid Loess Plateau, soil respiration, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; at upper and lower slope positions in triplicate from 2014 until 2016, and the soil biochemical and microbial properties were determined. The results showed that soil respiration was significantly greater (by 44.2%) at the lower slope position (2.6 μmol m&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;) than at the upper slope position, as were soil moisture, carbon, nitrogen fractions and root biomass. However, the temperature sensitivity was 13.2% greater at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The soil fungal community changed from being Basidiomycota-dominant at the upper slope position to being Zygomycota-dominant at the lower slope position, corresponding with increased β-D-glucosidase activity at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position. We concluded that soil respiration was enhanced by the greater soil moisture, root biomass, carbon and nitrogen contents at the lower slope position than at the upper slope position. Moreover, the increased soil respiration and decreased temperature sensitivity at the lower slope position were partially due to copiotrophs replacing oligotrophs. Such spatial variations along slopes must be properly accounted for when estimating the carbon budget and feedback of future climate change on hillslope ecosystems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Spatial variations of soil respiration and temperature sensitivity along a steep slope of the semiarid Loess Plateau</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</originId><fingerprint>767ae66b</fingerprint><author><name>Qiqi Sun</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523048400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd077:7c9981b6</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qiqi Sun, Rui Wang, Yaxian Hu, Lunguang Yao, Shengli Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover, the increased soil respiration and decreased temperature sensitivity at the lower slope position were partially due to copiotrophs replacing oligotrophs. Such spatial variations along slopes must be properly accounted for when estimating the carbon budget and feedback of future climate change on hillslope ecosystems.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled></item><item><title>[ASAP] Large-Scale Validation of Mixed-Solvent Simulations to Assess Hotspots at Protein–Protein Interaction Interfaces</title><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00487/20180410/images/medium/ci-2017-00487p_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00487&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Both rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) are associated with poor radiologic outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In general, RA patients positive for RF or ACPA (SPRA) are considered to manifest an aggressive disease course compared with seronegative RA patients (SNRA). However, the relationship between seropositivity and measures of disease severity other than radiologic outcome is disputed. In this study, we sought to compare the clinical presentations and treatment outcomes of SNRA and SPRA patients. A total of 241 patients diagnosed with DMARD-naïve RA under either 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria or 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria were identified (40 with SNRA and 201 with SPRA). We investigated the disease activity measures including ESR, CRP, patient VAS, 28 tender/swollen joint count (28 TJC, 28 SJC) and DAS28 as well as radiologic outcomes at baseline, 1 and 2 years after conventional treatment with DMARD. Age, sex and disease duration were similar between SNRA and SPRA. However, the baseline 28 TJC (4.7±2.9 vs. 3.3±2.7, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004), 28 SJC (4.3±3.0 vs. 2.9±2.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) and DAS28 (5.1±1.0 vs. 4.7±1.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.043) components were significantly higher in SNRA than in SPRA. Over 2 years of similar treatment with DMARDs, all disease activity measures significantly improved in both groups. Comparison among populations matched for baseline disease activity showed that ΔDAS28 at 1 year was greater in SNRA than in SPRA (-2.84±1.32 vs. -3.70±1.29, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.037) in high disease activity population (DAS28-ESR&gt;5.1). Radiologic outcomes at baseline and at 1- or 2-year follow-up were similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, SNRA patients manifested more active disease at baseline, but showed a better response to treatment compared with SPRA. SNRA does not appear to be a benign subtype of RA.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Clinical management of seronegative and seropositive rheumatoid arthritis: A comparative study</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195550</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195550</originId><fingerprint>32a907de</fingerprint><author><name>Sang-Tae Choi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195550</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523048400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd083:7c9981b6</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sang-Tae Choi, Kwang-Hoon Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Frailty is a risk factor for disability and mortality, and is more prevalent among African American (AA) elderly than whites. We examine frailty in middle-aged racially and economically diverse adults, and investigate how race, poverty and frailty are associated with mortality. Data were from 2541 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study in Baltimore, Maryland; 35–64 years old at initial assessment (56% women; 58% AA). Frailty was assessed using a modified FRAIL scale of fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness and weight loss, and compared with difficulties in physical functioning and daily activities. Frailty prevalence was calculated across race and age groups, and associations with survival were assessed by Cox Regression. 278 participants were frail (11%); 924 pre-frail (36%); 1339 not frail (53%). For those aged 45–54, a higher proportion of whites (13%) than AAs (8%) were frail; while the proportions were similar for those 55–64 (14%,16%). Frailty was associated with overall survival with an average follow-up of 6.6 years, independent of race, sex and poverty status (HR = 2.30; 95%CI 1.67–3.18). In this sample of economically and racially diverse older adults, the known association of frailty prevalence and age differed across race with whites having higher prevalence at younger ages. Frailty was associated with survival beyond the risk factors of race and poverty status in this middle-aged group. Early recognition of frailty at these younger ages may provide an effective method for preventing or delaying disabilities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Frailty in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of middle-aged Americans in Baltimore</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195637</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195637</originId><fingerprint>743ddfcb</fingerprint><author><name>Felicia R.

Often &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; are harmless and/or beneficial bacteria inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of livestock and humans. However, Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) have been linked to human disease. Cattle are the primary reservoir for STEC and STEC “super-shedders” are considered to be a major contributor in animal to animal transmission. Among STEC, O157:H7 is the most recognized serotype, but in recent years, non-O157 STEC have been increasingly linked to human disease. In Argentina and Germany, O178 is considered an emerging pathogen. Our objective was to compare populations of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178, O157, shiga toxin 1 and 2 in western Canadian cattle feces from a sampling pool of ~80,000 beef cattle collected at two slaughterhouses. Conventional PCR was utilized to screen 1,773 samples for presence/absence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178. A subset of samples (n = 168) was enumerated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and proportions of O178, O157 and shiga toxins 1 &amp;amp; 2 specific-fragments were calculated as a proportion of generic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (GEC) specific-fragments. Distribution of &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by comparing &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O157 enumerations. Conventional PCR detected the presence of O178 in 873 of 1,773 samples and ddPCR found the average proportion of O178, O157, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the samples 2.8%, 0.6%, 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively. Quantification of &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; revealed more virulence genes than could be exclusively attributed to O157. Our results confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178 in western Canadian cattle and ddPCR revealed O178 as a greater proportion of GEC than was O157.

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of 26–28 genes at chromosome band 7q11.23. The complete deletion (CD) mouse model mimics the most common deletion found in WBS patients and recapitulates most neurologic features of the disorder along with some cardiovascular manifestations leading to significant cardiac hypertrophy with increased cardiomyocytes’ size. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin found in green tea, has been associated with potential health benefits, both on cognition and cardiovascular phenotypes, through several mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of green tea extracts on WBS-related phenotypes through a phase I clinical trial in mice.

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of 26–28 genes at chromosome band 7q11.23. The complete deletion (CD) mouse model mimics the most common deletion found in WBS patients and recapitulates most neurologic features of the disorder along with some cardiovascular manifestations leading to significant cardiac hypertrophy with increased cardiomyocytes’ size. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin found in green tea, has been associated with potential health benefits, both on cognition and cardiovascular phenotypes, through several mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of green tea extracts on WBS-related phenotypes through a phase I clinical trial in mice. After feeding CD animals with green tea extracts dissolved in the drinking water, starting at three different time periods (prenatal, youth and adulthood), a set of behavioral tests and several anatomical, histological and molecular analyses were performed. Treatment resulted to be effective in the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and was also able to ameliorate short-term memory deficits of CD mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EGCG might have a therapeutic and/or preventive role in the management of WBS.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194476</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521481331028</crawled></item><item><content><content>A general relation is derived between the linear and second-order nonlinear ac conductivities of an electron system in the hydrodynamic regime of frequencies below the interparticle scattering rate.

Climate change is expected to affect resource-consumer interactions underlying stability in polar food webs. Polar benthic organisms have adapted to the marked seasonality characterising their habitats by concentrating foraging and reproductive activity in summer months, when inputs from sympagic and pelagic producers increase. While this enables the persistence of biodiverse food webs, the mechanisms underlying changes in resource use and nutrient transfer are poorly understood. Thus, our understanding of how temporal and spatial variations in the supply of resources may affect food web structure and functioning is limited. By means of C and N isotopic analyses of two key Antarctic benthic consumers (&lt;i&gt;Adamussium colbecki&lt;/i&gt;, Bivalvia, and &lt;i&gt;Sterechinus neumayeri&lt;/i&gt;, Echinoidea) and Bayesian mixing models, we describe changes in trophic niche and nutrient transfer across trophic levels associated with the long- and short-term diet and body size of specimens sampled in midsummer in both shallow and deep waters. Samplings occurred soon after the sea-ice broke up at Tethys Bay, an area characterised by extreme seasonality in sea-ice coverage and productivity in the Ross Sea. In the long term, the trophic niche was broader and variation between specimens was greater, with intermediate-size specimens generally consuming a higher number of resources than small and large specimens. The coupling of energy channels in the food web was consequently more direct than in the short term. Sediment and benthic algae were more frequently consumed in the long term, before the sea-ice broke up, while consumers specialised on sympagic algae and plankton in the short term. Regardless of the time scale, sympagic algae were more frequently consumed in shallow waters, while plankton was more frequently consumed in deep waters. Our results suggest a strong temporal relationship between resource availability and the trophic niche of benthic consumers in Antarctica. Potential climate-driven changes in the timing and quality of nutrient inputs may have profound implications for the structure of polar food webs and the persistence of their constituent species, which have adapted their trophic niches to a highly predictable schedule of resource inputs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Time- and depth-wise trophic niche shifts in Antarctic benthos</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194796</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194796</originId><fingerprint>4f3e0082</fingerprint><author><name>Edoardo Calizza</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194796</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521838800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d4:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edoardo Calizza, Giulio Careddu, Simona Sporta Caputi, Loreto Rossi, Maria Letizia Costantini&lt;/p&gt;

Network analysis of large metagenomic datasets generated by current sequencing technologies can reveal significant co-occurrence patterns between microbial species of a biological community. These patterns can be analyzed in terms of pairwise combinations between all species comprising a community. Here, we construct a co-occurrence network for abundant microbial species encompassing the three dominant phyla found in human gut. This was followed by an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation of the predicted microbe-microbe co-occurrences, where we chose species pairs &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium adolescentis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Roseburia inulinivorans&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms for our study. We then delineate the outcome of the co-cultures when equal distributions of resources were provided. The growth behavior of the co-culture was found to be dependent on the types of microbial species present, their specific metabolic activities, and resulting changes in the culture environment. Through this reductionist approach and using novel &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; combinations of microbial species under anaerobic conditions, the results of this work will aid in the understanding and design of synthetic community formulations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;In vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; co-cultures of human gut bacterial species as predicted from co-occurrence network analysis</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195161</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195161</originId><fingerprint>2723c0eb</fingerprint><author><name>Promi Das</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195161</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522443600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c53:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Promi Das, Boyang Ji, Petia Kovatcheva-Datchary, Fredrik Bäckhed, Jens Nielsen&lt;/p&gt;

SIMMS is generic and can work with any molecular data or biological network, and is freely available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SIMMS.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289934v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>a6fda01d</fingerprint><author><name>Haider, S.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289934v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522134000000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626967e384:6423c39:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289934v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/289934</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522186838916</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Te-Chun Yeh, Hsiao-Huang Chang, Luo-Ping Ger, Ju-O Wang, Senyeong Kao, Shung-Tai Ho&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;The ageing population and the expected increase in the number of elderly patients make an evidence-based assessment of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in old patients progressively more important. Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged &amp;lt;65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P&amp;lt;0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score. These risk factors can be utilized as potential predictors to identify the potential candidates for ECMO support.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Clinical risk factors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in older adults</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195445</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195445</originId><fingerprint>16e368fe</fingerprint><author><name>Te-Chun Yeh</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195445</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523048400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd07a:7c9981b6</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Te-Chun Yeh, Hsiao-Huang Chang, Luo-Ping Ger, Ju-O Wang, Senyeong Kao, Shung-Tai Ho&lt;/p&gt;

The regulatory role of miRNAs has been explored in ovarian cells, and their effects on gonadal development, apoptosis, ovulation, steroid production and corpus luteum (CL) development have been revealed. In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-29b at different stages of bovine CL development and predicted the target genes of miR-29b. We confirmed that miR-29b reduces the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), affects progesterone (PROG) secretion and regulates the function of the CL. RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b was significantly higher in functional CL phases than in the regressed CL phase. Immunohistochemistry showed that OXTR was expressed in both large and small CL cells and was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of these cells. We analyzed the expression levels of OXTR and found that transfection with a miR-29b mimic decreased OXTR expression, but transfection with the inhibitor had a limited effect on the expression of the OXTR protein. At the same time, the secretion of PROG was significantly increased in the miR-29b mimic-transfected group. We also analyzed the effect of miR-29b on the apoptosis of CL cells. Finally, we found that miR-29b could promote the proliferation of bovine CL cells. In conclusion, we found that miR-29b reduces the expression of OXTR and can promote PROG secretion and the proliferation of CL cells via OXTR.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>MiR-29b affects the secretion of PROG and promotes the proliferation of bovine corpus luteum cells</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</originId><fingerprint>b880d74f</fingerprint><author><name>Ming-Qiang Xu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522875600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ecc:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ming-Qiang Xu, Hao Jiang, Li-Qun Zhang, Xu-Lei Sun, Dan Luo, Yao Fu, Yan Gao, Bao Yuan, Jia-Bao Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Ultra-precision face turning of Al6061 mirrors using single point diamond turning (SPDT) was undertaken to investigate the correlation between the surface roughness and reflectance. By reducing the feed rate, the optimal feed rate when the chip formation became unstable was studied. Most importantly, the impact on the roughness and reflectance was examined when the chip formation ceased to be continuous. It was determined that for a feed rate below 3 mm/min, the surface roughness always improved as the feed rate decreased, at the cost of a reduction of the normalized reflectance. The reduction of reflectance was determined to be the result of the lower material removal rates that led to a discontinuous chip formation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Al6061 surface roughness and optical reflectance when machined by single point diamond turning at a low feed rate</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195083</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195083</originId><fingerprint>3d5da0e0</fingerprint><author><name>L.

We applied this method to the 6,4FeO+ + H2 → 6,4Fe+ + H2O, 6,4FeO+ + CH4 → 6,4Fe+ + CH3OH, and 7Mn+ + OCS → 5MnS+ + CO reactions, for which crossings between the different spin states are known to play essential roles in the overall reaction kinetics. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1520236800000</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162956fcc6f:a3d99e7:9f3b30f2</id><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25202?af=R</link><crawled>1522925554799</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Soon Keen Cheong, Jennifer M.

Here we demonstrate the application of a method that could accelerate the development of novel therapies by allowing direct and repeatable visualization of cellular function in the living eye, to study loss of vision in animal models of retinal disease, as well as evaluate the time course of retinal function following therapeutic intervention. We use high-resolution adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy to image fluorescence from the calcium sensor GCaMP6s. In mice with photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), we measured restored visual responses in ganglion cell layer neurons expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin ChrimsonR over a six-week period following significant loss of visual responses. Combining a fluorescent calcium sensor, a channelrhodopsin, and adaptive optics enables all-optical stimulation and recording of retinal neurons in the living eye. Because the retina is an accessible portal to the central nervous system, our method also provides a novel non-invasive method of dissecting neuronal processing in the brain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>All-optical recording and stimulation of retinal neurons &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; in retinal degeneration mice</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</originId><fingerprint>8b125121</fingerprint><author><name>Soon Keen Cheong</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0e:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Soon Keen Cheong, Jennifer M.

A sensitive and innovative assay system based on a micro-MEMS-fluxgate sensor and immunomagnetic beads-labels was developed for the rapid analysis of C-reactive proteins (CRP). The fluxgate sensor presented in this study was fabricated through standard micro-electro-mechanical system technology. A multi-loop magnetic core made of Fe-based amorphous ribbon was employed as the sensing element, and 3-D solenoid copper coils were used to control the sensing core. Antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic microbeads were strategically utilized as signal tags to label the CRP via the specific conjugation of CRP to polyclonal CRP antibodies. Separate Au film substrates were applied as immunoplatforms to immobilize CRP-beads labels through classical sandwich assays. Detection and quantification of the CRP at different concentrations were implemented by detecting the stray field of CRP labeled magnetic beads using the newly-developed micro-fluxgate sensor. The resulting system exhibited the required sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. A detection limit as low as 0.002 μg/mL CRP with a linearity range from 0.002 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL was achieved, and this suggested that the proposed biosystem possesses high sensitivity. In addition to the extremely low detection limit, the proposed method can be easily manipulated and possesses a quick response time. The response time of our sensor was less than 5 s, and the entire detection period for CRP analysis can be completed in less than 30 min using the current method. Given the detection performance and other advantages such as miniaturization, excellent stability and specificity, the proposed biosensor can be considered as a potential candidate for the rapid analysis of CRP, especially for point-of-care platforms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A sensitive and innovative detection method for rapid C-reactive proteins analysis based on a micro-fluxgate sensor system</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194631</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194631</originId><fingerprint>f78ae144</fingerprint><author><name>Lei Guo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194631</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522443600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c47:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lei Guo, Zhen Yang, Shaotao Zhi, Zhu Feng, Chong Lei, Yong Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore. The course aimed at introducing biological problems as well as some of the quantitative approaches commonly used when tackling those problems. We have run the course for three years with over 100 students attending. Building on this experience, we share 11 quick tips on how to run such an effective, interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students in the biosciences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lgYLCd2q9tA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Eleven quick tips for running an interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006039</link><recrawled>1522355043476</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006039</originId><fingerprint>643ea0e5</fingerprint><author><name>Timothy E.

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction following left ventricular (LV) failure is associated with poor prognosis. RV remodeling is thought initiated by the increase in the afterload of RV due to secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) to impaired LV function; however, RV molecular changes might occur in earlier stages of the disease. cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)-phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, widely used to treat PH through their pulmonary vasorelaxation properties, have shown direct cardiac benefits, but their impacts on the RV in LV diseases are not fully determined. Here we show that RV molecular alterations occur early in the absence of RV hemodynamic changes during LV pressure-overload and are ameliorated by PDE5 inhibition. Two-day moderate LV pressure-overload (transverse aortic constriction) neither altered RV pressure/ function nor RV weight in mice, while it induced only mild LV hypertrophy. Importantly, pathological molecular features were already induced in the RV free wall myocardium, including up-regulation of gene markers for hypertrophy and inflammation, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and calcineurin. Concomitant PDE5 inhibition (sildenafil) prevented induction of such pathological genes and activation of ERK and calcineurin in the RV as well as in the LV.

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction following left ventricular (LV) failure is associated with poor prognosis. RV remodeling is thought initiated by the increase in the afterload of RV due to secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) to impaired LV function; however, RV molecular changes might occur in earlier stages of the disease. cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)-phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, widely used to treat PH through their pulmonary vasorelaxation properties, have shown direct cardiac benefits, but their impacts on the RV in LV diseases are not fully determined. Here we show that RV molecular alterations occur early in the absence of RV hemodynamic changes during LV pressure-overload and are ameliorated by PDE5 inhibition. Two-day moderate LV pressure-overload (transverse aortic constriction) neither altered RV pressure/ function nor RV weight in mice, while it induced only mild LV hypertrophy. Importantly, pathological molecular features were already induced in the RV free wall myocardium, including up-regulation of gene markers for hypertrophy and inflammation, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and calcineurin. Concomitant PDE5 inhibition (sildenafil) prevented induction of such pathological genes and activation of ERK and calcineurin in the RV as well as in the LV. Importantly, dexamethasone also prevented these RV molecular changes, similarly to sildenafil treatment. These results suggest the contributory role of inflammation to the early pathological interventricular interaction between RV and LV. The current study provides the first evidence for the novel early molecular cross-talk between RV and LV, preceding RV hemodynamic changes in LV disease, and supports the therapeutic strategy of enhancing cGMP signaling pathway to treat heart diseases.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195528</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled></item><item><content><content>Expansions of simple sequence repeats, or microsatellites, have been linked to ∼30 neurological–neuromuscular diseases.

Fitting canine cancer incidences through a conventional regression model assumes constant statistical relationships across the study area in estimating the model coefficients. However, it is often more realistic to consider that these relationships may vary over space. Such a condition, known as spatial non-stationarity, implies that the model coefficients need to be estimated locally. In these kinds of local models, the geographic scale, or spatial extent, employed for coefficient estimation may also have a pervasive influence. This is because important variations in the local model coefficients across geographic scales may impact the understanding of local relationships. In this study, we fitted canine cancer incidences across Swiss municipal units through multiple regional models. We computed diagnostic summaries across the different regional models, and contrasted them with the diagnostics of the conventional regression model, using value-by-alpha maps and scalograms. The results of this comparative assessment enabled us to identify variations in the goodness-of-fit and coefficient estimates. We detected spatially non-stationary relationships, in particular, for the variables related to biological risk factors. These variations in the model coefficients were more important at small geographic scales, making a case for the need to model canine cancer incidences locally in contrast to more conventional global approaches. However, we contend that prior to undertaking local modeling efforts, a deeper understanding of the effects of geographic scale is needed to better characterize and identify local model relationships.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The importance of regional models in assessing canine cancer incidences in Switzerland</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195970</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195970</originId><fingerprint>231e0806</fingerprint><author><name>Gianluca Boo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195970</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523653200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363c:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gianluca Boo, Stefan Leyk, Christopher Brunsdon, Ramona Graf, Andreas Pospischil, Sara Irina Fabrikant&lt;/p&gt;

The relative age effect (RAE; i.e., an asymmetry in the birth distribution) is a bias observed in sport competitions that may favour relatively older athletes in talent identification. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RAE in elite soccer players competing in the Italian championships, even considering the discriminations of younger and older &lt;i&gt;Serie A&lt;/i&gt; players (in relation to the median age of the sample), and different positional roles (i.e., goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, forward) for each observed category. A total of 2051 players competing into the 2017–2018 Italian under-15 (n = 265), under-16 (n = 362), under-17 (n = 403), &lt;i&gt;Primavera&lt;/i&gt; (n = 421) and &lt;i&gt;Serie A&lt;/i&gt; (n = 600) championships were analysed. The birth-date distributions, grouped in four quartiles (i.e., January-March, Q1; April-June, Q2; July-September, Q3; October-December, Q4), were compared to a uniform distribution using Chi-squared analysis. The week of birth was analysed using Poisson regression. The results showed a large over-representation of players born in Q1 in all soccer player categories. However, the effect size of this trend resulted smaller as age increased. Individuals born in Q1 have about two-folds more chances to become a &lt;i&gt;Serie A&lt;/i&gt; player compared to those born in Q4. The Poisson regression analysis showed that RAE was greater for defenders than for forwards among all categories. Therefore, a strongly biased selection emerged among elite soccer players competing in Italian championships, highlighting how young individuals born in the first three months have many more chances to become elite players compared to the others.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The relative age effect is larger in Italian soccer top-level youth categories and smaller in &amp;lt;i&gt;Serie A&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196253</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196253</originId><fingerprint>f3edcc47</fingerprint><author><name>Paolo Riccardo Brustio</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196253</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524171600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7905:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paolo Riccardo Brustio, Corrado Lupo, Alexandru Nicolae Ungureanu, Riccardo Frati, Alberto Rainoldi, Gennaro Boccia&lt;/p&gt;

Use of virtual reality (VR) technology is often accompanied by a series of unwanted symptoms, including nausea and headache, which are characterised as ‘simulator sickness’. Sensory mismatch has been thought to lie at the heart of the problem and recent studies have shown that reducing cue mismatch in VR can have a therapeutic effect. Specifically, electrical stimulation of vestibular afferent nerves (galvanic vestibular stimulation; GVS) can reduce simulator sickness in VR. However, GVS poses a risk to certain populations and can also result in negative symptoms in normal, healthy individuals. Here, we tested whether noisy vestibular stimulation through bone-vibration can also reduce symptoms of simulator sickness. We carried out two experiments in which participants performed a spatial navigation task in VR and completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire over a series of trials. Experiment 1 was conducted using a high-end projection-based VR display, whereas Experiment 2 involved the use of a consumer head mounted display. During each trial, vestibular stimulation was either: 1) absent; 2) coupled with large angular accelerations of the projection camera; or 3) applied randomly throughout each trial. In half of the trials, participants actively navigated using a motion controller, and in the other half they were moved passively through the environment along pre-recorded motion trajectories. In both experiments we obtained lower simulator sickness scores when vestibular stimulation was coupled with angular accelerations of the camera. This effect was obtained for both active and passive movement control conditions, which did not differ. The results suggest that noisy vestibular stimulation can reduce simulator sickness, and that this effect appears to generalize across VR conditions. We propose further examination of this stimulation technique.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Influence of bone-conducted vibration on simulator sickness in virtual reality</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194137</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194137</originId><fingerprint>b6d54c28</fingerprint><author><name>Séamas Weech</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194137</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2812:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Séamas Weech, Jae Moon, Nikolaus F.

We propose further examination of this stimulation technique.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194137</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outsourcing is in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing is in, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04163-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As big pharma downsizes, contract research organizations are reaping the benefits.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Outsourcing is in</title><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outsourcing is in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing is in, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04163-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As big pharma downsizes, contract research organizations are reaping the benefits.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</originId><fingerprint>a35630b1</fingerprint><author><name>Esther Landhuis</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523430000000</published><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162b3f687a2:435f40:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>25</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</link><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04163-8/d41586-018-04163-8_15592930.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1523437701026</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Melania Melis, Mariano Mastinu, Massimiliano Arca, Roberto Crnjar, Iole Tomassini Barbarossa&lt;/p&gt;
Oral sensitivity to fats varies in individuals influencing nutritional status and health. Variations in oleic acid perception are associated with &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and odorant binding protein (&lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt;) polymorphisms, and 6-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-propylthiouracil (PROP) sensitivity, which is mediated by TAS2R38 receptor. L-Arginine (L-Arg) supplementation was shown to modify the perception of the five taste qualities. Here we analyzed the effect of three concentrations (5, 10, 15 mmol/L) of L-Arg on oral perception of oleic acid in forty-six subjects classified for PROP taster status and genotyped for &lt;i&gt;TAS2R38&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms. L-Arg supplementation was effective in increasing the perceived intensity of oleic acid in most subjects. The lowest concentration was the most effective, especially in PROP non-tasters or medium tasters, and in subjects with at least an allele A in &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt; loci. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were exploited to characterize the chemical interaction between L-Arg and oleic acid, showing that a stable 1:1 oleate·ArgH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; adduct can be formed, stabilized by a pair of hydrogen bonds. Results indicate that L-Arg, acting as a ‘carrier’ of fatty acids in saliva, can selectively modify taste response, and suggest that it may to be used in personalized dietetic strategies to optimize eating behaviors and health.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Effect of chemical interaction between oleic acid and L-Arginine on oral perception, as a function of polymorphisms of &amp;lt;i&gt;CD36&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&amp;lt;/i&gt; and genetic ability to taste 6-&amp;lt;i&gt;n&amp;lt;/i&gt;-propylthiouracil</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194953</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194953</originId><fingerprint>81f13ac0</fingerprint><author><name>Melania Melis</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194953</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34c3:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Melania Melis, Mariano Mastinu, Massimiliano Arca, Roberto Crnjar, Iole Tomassini Barbarossa&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;In urban Maharashtra, India, approximately half of mothers exclusively breastfeed. For children residing in informal settlements of Mumbai, this study examines factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding, and whether exclusive breastfeeding, in a community-based nutrition program to prevent and treat wasting among children under age three, is associated with enrolment during the mother’s pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The nutrition program conducted a cross-sectional endline survey (October-December 2015) of caregivers in intervention areas. Factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding for infants under six months of age were explored using multi-level logistic regressions. Additionally, program surveillance data collected during home-based counselling visits documented breastfeeding practices for children under six months of age. Using the surveillance data (January 2014-March 2016), exclusive breastfeeding status was regressed adjusting for child, maternal and socioeconomic characteristics, and whether the child was enrolled in the program in utero or after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The community-based endline survey included 888 mothers of infants. Mothers who received the nutrition program home visits or attended group counselling sessions were more likely to exclusively breastfeed (adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.16, 2.41). Having a normal weight-for-height z-score (adjusted odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.00, 2.45) was associated positively with exclusive breastfeeding. As expected, being an older infant aged three to five months (adjusted odds ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25, 0.48) and receiving a prelacteal feed after birth (adjusted odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.41, 0.80) were associated with lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding. Surveillance data (N = 3420) indicate that infants enrolled in utero have significantly higher odds of being exclusively breastfed (adjusted odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.30, 1.84) than infants enrolled after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Prenatal enrolment in community-based programs working on child nutrition in urban informal settlements of India can improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Participation of pregnant women in a community-based nutrition program in Mumbai&apos;s informal settlements: Effect on exclusive breastfeeding practices</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195619</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195619</originId><fingerprint>cee06caa</fingerprint><author><name>Sheila Chanani</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195619</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d747:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sheila Chanani, Anagha Waingankar, Neena Shah More, Shanti Pantvaidya, Armida Fernandez, Anuja Jayaraman&lt;/p&gt;

The anatomical location of adipose tissue might have direct implications for its functionality and risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. To determine the expression of genes related to energy expenditure and the levels of some adipokines, histological examinations, quantitative PCR, and protein expression measurements in adipocyte precursor cells were performed. Periaortic adipocytes were smaller than those from subcutaneous tissue. Moreover, weight gain induced periaortic adipocyte hypertrophy (r = -0.91, p&amp;lt;0.01). Compared to subcutaneous tissue, adiponectin, FABP4, IL-4 and IL-6 was decreased in periaortic adipocytes, whereas FGF21, UCP-1, PGC-1a, CITED1, Omentin and TFAM (Mitochondrial protein) increased. Upon analyzing patients’ clinical conditions, it emerged that the levels of PGC-1a both in male (r = -0.48 p&amp;lt;0.04) and female (r = -0.61, p&amp;lt;0.05) and TFAM in male (r = -0.72, p&amp;lt;0.0008) and female (r = -0.86, p&amp;lt;0.002) decreased significantly with progressive weight gain. However, no differences were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus 2 or Hyperlipidemia. Adipocytes surrounding the ascending aorta present markers of major thermogenic activity than those in subcutaneous tissue. Nevertheless, this characteristic might change, due to unfavorable metabolic conditions such as obesity, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Thermogenic capacity of human periaortic adipose tissue is transformed by body weight</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194269</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194269</originId><fingerprint>efb78e8a</fingerprint><author><name>Diana Vargas</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194269</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521493200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f3:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Vargas, Carolina López, Edward Acero, Edgar Benitez, Angélica Wintaco, Jaime Camacho, Marisol Carreño, Juan Umaña, Daniela Jimenez, Said Díaz, Fernando Lizcano&lt;/p&gt;

Advances in the understanding of molecular systems depend on specific tools like the disruption of genes to produce strains with the desired characteristics. The disruption of any mutagen sensitive (&lt;i&gt;mus&lt;/i&gt;) genes in the model fungus &lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. &lt;i&gt;mus-51&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mus-52&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;mus-53&lt;/i&gt;, orthologous to the human genes &lt;i&gt;KU70&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KU80&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;LIG4&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, provides efficient tools for gene targeting. Accordingly, we used RNA-sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification techniques to evaluate the effects of &lt;i&gt;mus-52&lt;/i&gt; deletion in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;crassa&lt;/i&gt; gene transcriptional modulation, and thus, infer its influence regarding metabolic response to extracellular availability of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Notably, the absence of MUS-52 affected the transcription of a vast number of genes, highlighting the expression of those coding for transcription factors, kinases, circadian clocks, oxi-reduction balance, and membrane- and nucleolus-related proteins. These findings may provide insights toward the KU molecular mechanisms, which have been related to telomere maintenance, apoptosis, DNA replication, and gene transcription regulation, as well as associated human conditions including immune system disorders, cancer, and aging.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;mus-52&amp;lt;/i&gt; disruption and metabolic regulation in &amp;lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&amp;lt;/i&gt;: Transcriptional responses to extracellular phosphate availability</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195871</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195871</originId><fingerprint>e6a3e1ab</fingerprint><author><name>Maíra P.

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria. The highest larval mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was 99% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (bNN112.3_TH) at 96 h, and the highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was 98% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (bNN121.4_TH) at 96 h. In contrast to the control groups (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and distilled water), the mortality rate of both mosquito larvae ranged between 0 and 7% at 72 h.

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria. The highest larval mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was 99% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (bNN112.3_TH) at 96 h, and the highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was 98% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (bNN121.4_TH) at 96 h. In contrast to the control groups (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and distilled water), the mortality rate of both mosquito larvae ranged between 0 and 7% at 72 h. Here, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. Additionally, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; associated with &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; has potential to be a biocontrol agent for mosquitoes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate in the Wistar rat the efficacy of various autologous nerve conduits with various forms of blood supply in reconstructing a 10-mm-long gap in the median nerve (MN) under conditions of local ischemia. A 10-mm-long median nerve defect was created in the right arm. A loose silicone tube was placed around the nerve gap zone, in order to simulate a local ischemic environment. Rats were divided in the following experimental groups (each with 20 rats): the nerve Graft (NG) group, in which the excised MN segment was reattached; the conventional nerve flap (CNF) and the arterialized neurovenous flap (ANVF) groups in which the gap was bridged with homonymous median nerve flaps; the prefabricated nerve flap (PNF) group in which the gap was reconstructed with a fabricated flap created by leaving an arteriovenous fistula in contact with the sciatic nerve for 5 weeks; and the two control groups, Sham and Excision groups. In the latter group, the proximal stump of the MN nerve was ligated and no repair was performed. The rats were followed for 100 days. During this time, they did physiotherapy. Functional, electroneuromyographic and histological studies were performed. The CNF and ANVF groups presented better results than the NG group in the following assessments: grasping test, nociception, motor stimulation threshold, muscle weight, and histomorphometric evaluation. Radial deviation of the operated forepaw was more common in rats that presented worse results in the other outcome variables. Overall, CNFs and ANVFs produced a faster and more complete recovery than NGs in the reconstruction of a 10-mm-long median nerve gap in an ischemic environment in the Wistar rat. Although, results obtained with CNFs were in most cases were better than ANVFs, these differences were not statistically significant for most of the outcome variables.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Reconstruction of a 10-mm-long median nerve gap in an ischemic environment using autologous conduits with different patterns of blood supply: A comparative study in the rat</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195692</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195692</originId><fingerprint>17b4cadf</fingerprint><author><name>Diogo Casal</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195692</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523912400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7adb:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diogo Casal, Eduarda Mota-Silva, Inês Iria, Sara Alves, Ana Farinho, Cláudia Pen, Nuno Lourenço-Silva, Luís Mascarenhas-Lemos, José Silva-Ferreira, Mário Ferraz-Oliveira, Valentina Vassilenko, Paula Alexandra Videira, João Goyri-O’Neill, Diogo Pais&lt;/p&gt;

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where burden, impact, and incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the highest in the world, conversely, the epidemiology of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is incompletely known. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of influenza-associated SARI in hospitalized children in Maputo city, Mozambique. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children aged 0–14 years old who met the case definition for SARI in two hospitals in Maputo city after their parents or legal representative consented to participate. A structured questionnaire was used to collect clinical and demographic data. Typing and subtyping of influenza were performed by real-time PCR. From January 2014 to December 2016, a total of 2,007 eligible children were recruited, of whom 1,997 (99.5%) were screened for influenza by real-time PCR. The median age of participants was 16.9 months (IQR: 7.0–38.9 months) and 53.9% (1076/1991) were male. A total of 77 were positive for influenza, yielding a frequency of 3.9% (77/1,991), with the highest frequency being reported in the age group 1–5 years old. Cases of influenza peaked twice each year, during which, its frequency reached up to 60%-80%. Among all influenza confirmed cases, 33.7% (26/77), 35.1% (27/77) and 28.6% (22/77) were typed as influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B, respectively. This represents the first report of influenza in urban/sub urban setting in Mozambique and the first evidence of distribution of strains of influenza in the country. Our data showed that frequency of influenza was lower than reported in a rural setting in Mozambique and the frequency of seasonal (A/H1N1pdm09) and (A/H3N2) subtypes were similar in children with SARI.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Clinical and epidemiological characterization of influenza virus infections in children with severe acute respiratory infection in Maputo, Mozambique: Results from the implementation of sentinel surveillance, 2014 – 2016</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194138</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194138</originId><fingerprint>abf3927</fingerprint><author><name>Neuza Nguenha</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194138</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2813:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neuza Nguenha, Almiro Tivane, Mirela Pale, Loira Machalele, Afonso Nacoto, Germano Pires, Edirsse Mationane, Judite Salência, Félix Gundane, Délcio Muteto, Josina Chilundo, Sandra Mavale, Noorbebi Adamo, Cynthia Semá-Baltazar, Orvalho Augusto, Eduardo Gudo, Tufária Mussá&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of the study was to develop Tizanidine HCl (TZN) and Meloxicam (MLX) loaded bilayer mucoadhesive films intended for buccal administration, aiming to enhance the bioavailability. Bilayer films were prepared by solvent evaporation technique selecting arabinoxylan (ARX) as a sustained release (SR) layer forming polymer and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) E-15 as an immediate release (IR) layer-forming polymer. Prepared films were subjected to &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug release, surface morphology, mechanical strength, compatibility of the ingredients, drug contents, &lt;i&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/i&gt; mucoadhesion strength and drug permeation. Crossover study design was applied to study the i&lt;i&gt;n-vivo&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetics by using albino rabbits. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; of both drugs loaded in films were compared with standard solution/dispersion administered to the rabbits at the dose of 1mg/kg. The results unveiled instant release and permeation of MLX from IR layer, while good controlled release and permeation characteristics of TZN from SR films over 8 h. films were of uniform thickness with smooth surface and satisfactory mechanical strength. Mucoadhesion strength was sufficient to provide suitable contact time with mucosal membrane. The pharmacokinetic study exhibited prompt absorption of MLX with better AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (6655.64 ng/ml*h vs 6538.99 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (436.98 ng/ml vs 411.33 ng/ml) from oral dispersion. Similarly buccal films has shown enhanced half-life (9.91hr vs 2.51 hr), AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (1043.4 ng/ml*h vs 149.1 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (91.92 ng/ml vs 42.29 ng/ml) from oral solution. A statistical investigation disclosed a significantly improved pharmacokinetics of TZN and MLX after their absorption across buccal route following administration of buccal film &lt;i&gt;(p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05)&lt;/i&gt;. ARX proved expedient and bilayer buccal films as a drug delivery system ascertained the dual effect of providing instant release of one active agent and persistent release of another one with improved pharmacokinetics.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Development of Tizanidine HCl-Meloxicam loaded mucoadhesive buccal films: &amp;lt;i&gt;In-vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;in-vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; evaluation</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194410</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194410</originId><fingerprint>7e821da9</fingerprint><author><name>Muhammad Zaman</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194410</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123926:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Zaman, Muhammad Hanif, Zaib Ali Shaheryar&lt;/p&gt;

Sponge-cyanobacteria associations have attracted research interest from an ecological, evolutionary and biotechnological perspective. Current knowledge is, in its majority, “hidden” in metagenomics research studying the entire microbial communities of sponges, while knowledge on these associations is totally missing for certain geographic areas. In this study, we (a) investigated the occurrence of cyanobacteria in 18 sponge species, several of which are studied for the first time for their cyanobionts, from a previously unexplored eastern Mediterranean ecoregion, the Aegean Sea, (b) isolated sponge-associated cyanobacteria, and characterized them based on a polyphasic (morphological-morphometric and molecular phylogenetic analysis) approach, and (c) conducted a meta-analysis on the global diversity of sponge species hosting cyanobacteria, as well as the diversity of cyanobacterial symbionts. Our research provided new records for nine sponge species, previously unknown for this association, while the isolated cyanobacteria were found to form novel clades within &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/i&gt;, Leptolyngbyaceae, Pseudanabaenaceae, and Schizotrichaceae, whose taxonomic status requires further investigation; this is the first report of a Schizotrichaceae cyanobacterium associated with sponges. The extensive evaluation of the literature along with the new data from the Aegean Sea raised the number of sponge species known for hosting cyanobacteria to 320 and showed that the cyanobacterial diversity reported from sponges is yet underestimated.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Sponges-Cyanobacteria associations: Global diversity overview and new data from the Eastern Mediterranean</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195001</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195001</originId><fingerprint>8308395c</fingerprint><author><name>Despoina Konstantinou</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195001</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef17:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Despoina Konstantinou, Vasilis Gerovasileiou, Eleni Voultsiadou, Spyros Gkelis&lt;/p&gt;

Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a risk factor of osteoporotic fracture (OF). Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) can differentiate into osteoclasts to resorb bone. It was known that PBM-expressed Anxa2 protein is associated with BMD, and extracellular Anxa2 protein promotes osteoclastogenesis. This study aimed to test 1) whether Anxa2 protein level in PBM differs significantly between subjects with OF and without fracture history (NF); 2) whether Anxa2 level in plasma is associated with BMD; 3) how Anxa2 protein at various concentrations would affect osteoblastic activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. All the study subjects were Chinese Han elderly. Firstly, Anxa2 protein in PBM was identified and quantitated by LC-MS/MS and compared between 45 OF cases and 42 healthy controls. Secondly, plasma Anxa2 protein level was quantitated by ELISA and compared between unrelated subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD (0.63±0.10 vs. 1.05±0.10 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, n = 75). Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; functional assay was utilized to test the effects of extracellular Anxa2 protein on osteoblastic growth. We found that Anxa2 protein expression in PBM was significantly up-regulated in OF vs. NF subjects (fold change [FC)] = 1.16, P&amp;lt;0.05). Plasma Anxa2 protein concentration (range: 31.69–227.35ng/ml) was significantly elevated in low vs. high BMD subjects (84.85 vs. 66.15ng/ml, FC = 1.28, P&amp;lt;0.05). Cellular dynamical monitoring demonstrated that the general shape of dose-response relationship is the inverse U-shaped curve. Specifically, lower dose of Anxa2 protein may promote osteoblast growth and the optimal concentration for osteoblastic growth was around 50ng/ml, but even higher concentration could attenuate hFOB1.19 osteoprogenitor cell growth. We concluded that Anxa2 protein could attenuate osteoblast growth and be associated with hip BMD and OF in Chinese elderly.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Anxa2 attenuates osteoblast growth and is associated with hip BMD and osteoporotic fracture in Chinese elderly</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194781</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194781</originId><fingerprint>2885684e</fingerprint><author><name>Xu Zhou</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194781</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521838800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d1:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Wen-Yu Wang, Xin Lu, Zhen-Huan Jiang, Yun-Hong Zhang, Ding-Hua Jiang, Jian-Nong Jiang, Hong-Qing Gao, Shu-Feng Lei, Fei-Yan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

Plasma Anxa2 protein concentration (range: 31.69–227.35ng/ml) was significantly elevated in low vs. high BMD subjects (84.85 vs. 66.15ng/ml, FC = 1.28, P&amp;lt;0.05). Cellular dynamical monitoring demonstrated that the general shape of dose-response relationship is the inverse U-shaped curve. Specifically, lower dose of Anxa2 protein may promote osteoblast growth and the optimal concentration for osteoblastic growth was around 50ng/ml, but even higher concentration could attenuate hFOB1.19 osteoprogenitor cell growth. We concluded that Anxa2 protein could attenuate osteoblast growth and be associated with hip BMD and OF in Chinese elderly.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194781</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521826743954</crawled></item><item><content><content>In the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP), protein misfolding leads to fatal consequences for cell metabolism and rod and cone cell survival.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Product packaging has long been used by the tobacco industry to target consumers and manipulate product perceptions. This study examines the extent to which cigarillo packaging influences perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A web-based experiment was conducted among young adults. Participants viewed three randomly selected cigarillo packs, varying on pack flavor descriptor, color, type, branding, and warning—totaling 180 pack images. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effect of pack elements on product perceptions.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2,664 current, ever, and never little cigar and cigarillo users participated. Cigarillo packs with a flavor descriptor were perceived as having a more favorable taste (β = 0.21, p &amp;lt; .001) and smell (β = 0.14, p &amp;lt; .001) compared to packs with no flavor descriptor. Compared to packs with no color, pink and purple packs were more likely to be perceived as containing a flavor (β = 0.11, p &amp;lt; .001), and were rated more favorably on taste (β = 0.17, p &amp;lt; .001), smell (β = 0.15, p &amp;lt; .001), and appeal (β = 0.16, p &amp;lt; .001).

Background &lt;p&gt;People who use a cochlear implant together with a contralateral hearing aid—so-called bimodal listeners—have poor localisation abilities and sounds are often not balanced in loudness across ears. In order to address the latter, a loudness balancing algorithm was created, which equalises the loudness growth functions for the two ears. The algorithm uses loudness models in order to continuously adjust the two signals to loudness targets. Previous tests demonstrated improved binaural balance, improved localisation, and better speech intelligibility in quiet for soft phonemes. In those studies, however, all stimuli were preprocessed so spontaneous head movements and individual head-related transfer functions were not taken into account. Furthermore, the hearing aid processing was linear.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;In the present study, we simplified the acoustical loudness model and implemented the algorithm in a real-time system. We tested bimodal listeners on speech perception and on sound localisation, both in normal loudness growth configuration and in a configuration with a modified loudness growth function.

Background &lt;p&gt;People who use a cochlear implant together with a contralateral hearing aid—so-called bimodal listeners—have poor localisation abilities and sounds are often not balanced in loudness across ears. In order to address the latter, a loudness balancing algorithm was created, which equalises the loudness growth functions for the two ears. The algorithm uses loudness models in order to continuously adjust the two signals to loudness targets. Previous tests demonstrated improved binaural balance, improved localisation, and better speech intelligibility in quiet for soft phonemes. In those studies, however, all stimuli were preprocessed so spontaneous head movements and individual head-related transfer functions were not taken into account. Furthermore, the hearing aid processing was linear.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;In the present study, we simplified the acoustical loudness model and implemented the algorithm in a real-time system. We tested bimodal listeners on speech perception and on sound localisation, both in normal loudness growth configuration and in a configuration with a modified loudness growth function. We also used linear and compressive hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The comparison between the original acoustical loudness model and the new simplified model showed loudness differences below 3% for almost all tested speech-like stimuli and levels. We found no effect of balancing the loudness growth across ears for speech perception ability in quiet and in noise. We found some small improvements in localisation performance.

Inertial sensors offer the potential for integration into wireless virtual reality systems that allow the users to walk freely through virtual environments. However, owing to drift errors, inertial sensors cannot accurately estimate head and body orientations in the long run, and when walking indoors, this error cannot be corrected by magnetometers, due to the magnetic field distortion created by ferromagnetic materials present in buildings. This paper proposes a technique, called EHBD (Equalization of Head and Body Directions), to address this problem using two head- and shoulder-located magnetometers. Due to their proximity, their distortions are assumed to be similar and the magnetometer measurements are used to detect when the user is looking straight forward. Then, the system corrects the discrepancies between the estimated directions of the head and the shoulder, which are provided by gyroscopes and consequently are affected by drift errors. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of this technique in two tasks (navigation and navigation plus exploration) and using two different locomotion techniques: (1) gaze-directed mode (GD) in which the walking direction is forced to be the same as the head direction, and (2) decoupled direction mode (DD) in which the walking direction can be different from the viewing direction. The obtained results show that both locomotion modes show similar matching of the target path during the navigation task, while DD’s path matches the target path more closely than GD in the navigation plus exploration task. These results validate the EHBD technique especially when allowing different walking and viewing directions in the navigation plus exploration tasks, as expected. While the proposed method does not reach the accuracy of optical tracking (ideal case), it is an acceptable and satisfactory solution for users and is much more compact, portable and economical.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Natural locomotion based on a reduced set of inertial sensors: Decoupling body and head directions indoors</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195191</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195191</originId><fingerprint>5fed306f</fingerprint><author><name>Ernesto de la Rubia</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195191</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4601:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto de la Rubia, Antonio Diaz-Estrella, Arcadio Reyes-Lecuona, Alyson Langley, Michael Brown, Sarah Sharples&lt;/p&gt;

It makes sense – if you want things to react, getting all the partners dissolved in some medium where they can roam around and contact each other is surely the way to go, most of the time. But it’s also true that we don’t really have a good grasp of what’s happening in solution at the molecular level. Solvation shells, nanoscale aggregates and clusters, effects of interfacial regions: the idealized picture of things floating around is complicated by a lot of real-world effects, which can be very important. They’re particularly so when it comes to dissolution and its opposite, precipitation and crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the formation of microcrystals. I know that I had a mental picture of these that is probably incorrect. As I imagined it, all sorts of nucleation events happened in solution but the size of the resulting crystals was constrained (perhaps by amount of available solute, or by effects of stirring) so that they just didn’t grow very large. But in many systems, it appears that what happens first is a liquid-liquid phase separation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;sound familiar?&lt;/a&gt;), what’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition&quot;&gt;spinodal decomposition&lt;/a&gt; into microscopic solute-rich and solute-poor droplets, and the solute-rich ones then crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201711128&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; provides another example of liquid-phase weirdness. The authors are looking at a very well-known reaction, reduction of a metal salt to the elemental metal. That sentence hides a lot of complications: for example, what form does this metal arrive in? You can get a mirror deposit on the inside wall of the vessel (as with the famous old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent&quot;&gt;Tollens reagent&lt;/a&gt; or the other more stable mirror-silvering mixtures), but more often you get some sort of fine black powder. Microscopic examination of that, though, reveals a huge range of particle sizes and morphologies depending on conditions, and it’s just those changes that can make a big difference in (for example) catalyst performance. Finely divided high-surface-area metals (palladium/platinum on carbon, Raney nickel, Rieke metals) are very important in synthetic chemistry, and their properties vary tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work provides an ingenious variation. The authors take an aqueous solution of the metal salt (silver nitrate in the first example), freeze it in liquid nitrogen, and then let this ice chunk slowly dissolve in a cold solution of the reducing agent (sodium borohydride). That gives, under the right conditions, essentially an atom-by-atom release of silver ions into the solution, and what you get out is atomically dispersed metal. By electron microscopy, the great bulk of the material is produced as what are apparently single silver atoms, not clusters, aggregates, etc. (there’s also further characterization by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_X-ray_absorption_fine_structure&quot;&gt;EXAFS&lt;/a&gt;). I’m surprised that it doesn’t form those on standing, but as I said before, there are a lot of things about the solution phase that my mental models don’t handle well. The authors believe (on the basis of modeling calculations) that the solvation shell around the single metal atoms is a barrier to forming such nanoparticles, and that the release of individual metal atoms is thus key to the whole process. Dimers of silver atoms and the like seem to be just fine in aqueous solution if they can form (or if they’re whittled down to that size); this synthesis just doesn’t let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates the same sort of chemistry with a whole list of metals – platinum, palladium, cobalt, nickel, copper, iridium, gold and more. It certainly seems to be a general process, and the resulting atomically dispersed metals would, you’d have to imagine, be very active catalysts in further reactions. What’s more, this entire method would seem to have applications in many other reactions, too, where the slow release of one reactant into an excess of another is important. I’m actually kicking myself not to have thought of something like this – in hindsight it seems like a perfectly simple idea, but try coming up with these in the forward direction!&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects a large number of people throughout the world. Anxiety, depression and fatigue are common symptoms of SLE that substantially contribute to decreased quality of life. This study investigates the interplay between physical and psychiatric manifestations of lupus. To this end, an SLE patient cohort was examined for correlations between clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and psychological indicators.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy-two lupus patients were evaluated for psychological status using a battery of instruments, including assessments for fatigue (CFS &amp;amp; FSS), depression (HADS), anxiety (HADS), overall health (SF-36 &amp;amp; PSQI) and intimate relationship satisfaction (RAS &amp;amp; CSI). Scores from these assessments were correlated with lupus clinical profiles and laboratory test values.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of depression in the SLE patient cohort was 41.7%, as measured by the hospital depression and anxiety scale. The study identified that pain (p = 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.026), Chalder’s fatigue scale (p &amp;lt; 0.001), fatigue severity scale (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001) are all positively correlated with depression in SLE patients. Total complement (CH50) (p = 0.032), and SF-36 physical and mental characteristic assessments are negatively correlated with depression. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the disease related complaint alopecia (p = 0.008) and relationship assessment scale scores (p = 0.004) may also be correlated to depression in SLE patients. Multivariant scrutiny of the clinical and psychosocial characteristics identified the fatigue severity scale (p = 0.026), SF-36 physical function (p = 0.040), physical role function (0.030), and mental health (p = 0.002) as the best indicators directly correlated with depression for the SLE cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results reveal the influence of physical manifestations of lupus including fatigue, pain, body mass index and anxiety, as well as decreased physical and mental function, on depression. Fatigue is the strongest factor correlated with depression in SLE patients in the cohort. Both physical and social/psychological aspects likely contribute to the depression and anxiety in lupus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Correlation between physical markers and psychiatric health in a Portuguese systemic lupus erythematosus cohort: The role of suffering in chronic autoimmune disease</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195579</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195579</originId><fingerprint>14635716</fingerprint><author><name>Margarida Figueiredo-Braga</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195579</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523912400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ad8:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Margarida Figueiredo-Braga, Caleb Cornaby, Miguel Bernardes, Marta Figueiredo, Cristina Dos Santos Mesquita, Lúcia Costa, Brian D.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale Drop-seq dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods. In the case study applied to in-house Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) scRNA-seq data, scVDMC revealed several new cell types and unknown markers validated by flow cytometry.

The growing area of European hazelnut (&lt;i&gt;Corylus avellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is increasing, as well as the number of producing countries, and there is a pressing need for new improved cultivars. Hazelnut conventional breeding process is slow, due to the length of juvenile phase and the high heterozygosity level. The development of genetic linkage maps and the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to QTL (quantitative trait loci) of agronomic interest are essential tools for speeding up the selection of seedlings carrying desired traits through marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to enrich a previous linkage map and confirm QTL related to time of leaf budburst, using an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; population obtained by crossing Tonda Gentile delle Langhe with Merveille de Bollwiller. Genotyping-by-Sequencing was used to identify a total of 9,999 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Well saturated linkage maps were constructed for each parent using the double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. A reciprocal translocation was detected in Tonda Gentile delle Langhe between two non-homologous chromosomes. Applying a bioinformatic approach, we were able to disentangle ‘pseudo-linkage’ between markers, removing markers around the translocation breakpoints and obtain a linear order of the markers for the two chromosomes arms, for each linkage group involved in the translocation. Twenty-nine QTL for time of leaf budburst were identified, including a stably expressed region on LG_02 of the Tonda Gentile delle Langhe map. The stability of these QTL and their coding sequence content indicates promise for the identification of specific chromosomal regions carrying key genes involved in leaf budburst.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>High density SNP mapping and QTL analysis for time of leaf budburst in &amp;lt;i&gt;Corylus avellana&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195408</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195408</originId><fingerprint>809ef603</fingerprint><author><name>Daniela Torello Marinoni</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195408</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522702800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7693b:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Torello Marinoni, Nadia Valentini, Ezio Portis, Alberto Acquadro, Chiara Beltramo, Shawn A.

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses. The most prominent effect was decreased pelvic rise that occurred as the rider was actively rising up in the stirrups, thus creating a downward momentum counteracting the horses push off. This mimics a push off lameness in the hindlimb that is in stance when the rider sits down in the saddle during the rising trot. On the circle, the asymmetries induced by rising trot on the correct diagonal counteracted the circle induced asymmetries, rendering the horse more symmetrical. This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness. This theory needs to be studied further in clinically lame horses.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Influence of seating styles on head and pelvic vertical movement symmetry in horses ridden at trot</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</originId><fingerprint>b3a0b371</fingerprint><author><name>Emma Persson-Sjodin</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4615:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Persson-Sjodin, Elin Hernlund, Thilo Pfau, Pia Haubro Andersen, Marie Rhodin&lt;/p&gt;

No significant survival benefit was shown by CCRT regardless of OS (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.73–1.89, P = 0.508), PFS (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.38–1.50, P = 0.430), DMFS (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.33–2.41, P = 0.816), or LRRFS (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.95–1.12, P = 0.498). Additionally, CCRT notably increased the risk of acute grade 3–4 leukopenia (OR = 4.432, 95% CI 2.195–8.952, P &amp;lt; 0.001), compared to IMRT alone.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Adding concurrent chemotherapy to IMRT led to no survival benefit and increased acute toxicity reactions for stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194733</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521741783044</crawled></item><item><title>An efficient and scalable pipeline for epitope tagging in mammalian stem cells using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><description>CRISPR/Cas9 can be used for precise genetic knock-in of epitope tags into endogenous genes, simplifying experimental analysis of protein function.

Although significant attention has been devoted to analyzing stigma associated with epilepsy, there is still a significant lack of valid and reliable instruments. We aimed to validate the 23-item Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE; originally developed in Brazil), which has been used to evaluate epilepsy-related stigma in the general population. Verification of the SSE questionnaire was carried out in a group of 207 students aged 15–18 years of whom none had epilepsy. These students completed the SSE twice in a period of 3–6 months as part of standard test-retest evaluation practice. The instrument exhibits good psychometric properties including internal consistency higher than in the original version (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.856 here compared with 0.81 reported in Brazil) and acceptable test-retest reliability. Using exploratory factor analysis (not provided for the original version), four factors were identified and corresponding subscales were described and interpreted. Two items did not fit into the structure and were eliminated. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to propose and verify the hierarchical 4-factor structure of the Czech version of SSE confirming the existence of a common factor corresponding to stigma. The results showed that the Czech version of SSE has good psychometric properties and can be used in further research and clinical practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Psychometric properties of the Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195225</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195225</originId><fingerprint>a2b21182</fingerprint><author><name>Dana Brabcová</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195225</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde2b:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dana Brabcová, Jiří Kohout, Daniel Potužák, Barbora Beňová, Pavel Kršek&lt;/p&gt;

HLA proteins have an essential role in the presentation of self and non-self peptides, as part of the adaptive immune response. Amongst the associated drugs-allele combinations, anti-HIV drug Abacavir has been shown to be associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele, and anti-epilepsy drug Carbamazepine with B*15:02, in both cases likely following the altered peptide repertoire model of interaction.

In this study, in silico docking was used to assess the utility and reliability of well-known docking programs when addressing these challenging HLA-drug situations. Four docking programs: SwissDock, ROSIE, AutoDock Vina and AutoDockFR, were used to investigate if each software could accurately dock the Abacavir back into the crystal structure for the protein arising from the known risk allele, and if they were able to distinguish between the HLA-associated and non-HLA-associated (control) alleles.

Our findings highlight the importance of gene regulatory architectures in the evolution of gene expression.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522886400000</published><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16295c56e9c:a2cdea9:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32323</link><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32323</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522931166876</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyu Liang, Helen Lum, Andrea Alvarez, Jose de Jesus Garduno-Garcia, Benjamin J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The root cause behind the low-grade inflammatory state seen in insulin resistant (obesity and type 2 diabetes) states is unclear. Insulin resistant subjects have elevations in plasma free fatty acids (FFA), which are ligands for the pro-inflammatory toll-like receptor (TLR)4 pathway. We tested the hypothesis that an experimental elevation in plasma FFA (within physiological levels) in lean individuals would upregulate TLR4 and activate downstream pathways (e.g., MAPK) in circulating monocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Research design and methods &lt;p&gt;Twelve lean, normal glucose-tolerant subjects received a low dose (30 ml/h) 48 h lipid or saline infusion on two different occasions. Monocyte TLR4 protein level, MAPK phosphorylation, and expression of genes in the TLR pathway were determined before and after each infusion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The lipid infusion significantly increased monocyte TLR4 protein and phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Lipid-mediated increases in TLR4 and p38 phosphorylation directly correlated with reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity (M value). Lipid increased levels of multiple genes linked to inflammation, including several TLRs, CD180, MAP3K7, and CXCL10. Monocytes exposed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; to lipid infusion exhibited enhanced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; basal and LPS-stimulated IL-1β secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In lean subjects, a small increase in plasma FFA (as seen in insulin resistant subjects) is sufficient to upregulate TLR4 and stimulate inflammatory pathways (MAPK) in monocytes. Moreover, lipids prime monocytes to endotoxin. We provide proof-of-concept data in humans indicating that the low-grade inflammatory state characteristic of obesity and type 2 diabetes could be caused (at least partially) by pro-inflammatory monocytes activated by excess lipids present in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A low dose lipid infusion is sufficient to induce insulin resistance and a pro-inflammatory response in human subjects</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195810</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195810</originId><fingerprint>26ad51de</fingerprint><author><name>Hanyu Liang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195810</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66cd:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyu Liang, Helen Lum, Andrea Alvarez, Jose de Jesus Garduno-Garcia, Benjamin J.

Using in-field bioreactors, we investigated the influence of exogenous microorganisms in groundwater planktonic and biofilm microbial communities as part of the Integrated Field Research Challenge (IFRC). After an acclimation period with source groundwater, bioreactors received either filtered (0.22 μM filter) or unfiltered well groundwater in triplicate and communities were tracked routinely for 23 days after filtration was initiated. To address geochemical influences, the planktonic phase was assayed periodically for protein, organic acids, physico-/geochemical measurements and bacterial community (via 16S rRNA gene sequencing), while biofilms (i.e. microbial growth on sediment coupons) were targeted for bacterial community composition at the completion of the experiment (23 d). Based on Bray-Curtis distance, planktonic bacterial community composition varied temporally and between treatments (filtered, unfiltered bioreactors). Notably, filtration led to an increase in the dominant genus, &lt;i&gt;Zoogloea&lt;/i&gt; relative abundance over time within the planktonic community, while remaining relatively constant when unfiltered. At day 23, biofilm communities were more taxonomically and phylogenetically diverse and substantially different from planktonic bacterial communities; however, the biofilm bacterial communities were similar regardless of filtration. These results suggest that although planktonic communities were sensitive to groundwater filtration, bacterial biofilm communities were stable and resistant to filtration. Bioreactors are useful tools in addressing questions pertaining to microbial community assembly and succession. These data provide a first step in understanding how an extrinsic factor, such as a groundwater inoculation and flux of microbial colonizers, impact how microbial communities assemble in environmental systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Use of in-field bioreactors demonstrate groundwater filtration influences planktonic bacterial community assembly, but not biofilm composition</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194663</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194663</originId><fingerprint>96380ad6</fingerprint><author><name>Geoff A.

Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has devastated the cattle industry in Sri Lanka many times in the past. Despite its seriousness, limited attempts have been made to understand the disease to ameliorate its effects–current recommendation for vaccines being based solely on immunological assessments rather than on molecular identification. The general belief is that the cattle population in Sri Lanka acquired the FMD virus (FMDV) strains via introductions from India. However, there could be endemic FMDV lineages circulating in Sri Lanka. To infer the phylogenetic relationships of the FMDV strains in the island, we sequenced the VP1 genomic region of the virus isolates collected during the 2014 outbreak together with a few reported cases in 2012 and 1997 and compared them to VP1 sequences from South Asia. The FMDV strains collected in the 2014 outbreak belonged to the lineage, Ind-2001d, of the topotype, ME-SA. The strains collected in 2012 and 1997 belonged to another lineage called &apos;unnamed&apos; by the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease (WRLFMD). Based on the present analysis, we designate the lineage &apos;unnamed&apos; as Srl-97 which we found endemic to Sri Lanka. The evolutionary rates of Srl-97 and Ind-2001d in Sri Lanka were estimated to be 0.0004 and 0.0046 substitutions/site/year, respectively, suggesting that Srl-97 evolves slowly.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The phylogenetic analysis of VP1 genomic region in foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype O isolates in Sri Lanka reveals the existence of &apos;Srl-97&apos;, a newly named endemic lineage</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194077</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194077</originId><fingerprint>601ed344</fingerprint><author><name>S.

Molecular characterization of early hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains rare. Ten out of 78 patients of a hematology/oncology center were found to be HCV RNA positive two to four months after hospitalization. Only two of the ten patients were anti-HCV positive. HCV hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) was amplified in seven patients (including one anti-HCV positive) and analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS). Genetic variants were reconstructed by Shorah and an empirically established 0.5% variant frequency cut-off was implemented. These sequences were compared by phylogenetic and diversity analyses. Ten unrelated blood donors with newly acquired HCV infection detected at the time of donation (HCV RNA positive and anti-HCV negative) served as controls. One to seven HVR1 variants were found in each patient. Sequences intermixed phylogenetically with no evidence of clustering in individual patients. These sequences were more similar to each other (similarity 95.4% to 100.0%) than to those of controls (similarity 64.8% to 82.6%). An identical predominant variant was present in four patients, whereas other closely related variants dominated in the remaining three patients. In five patients the HCV population was limited to a single variant or one predominant variant and minor variants of less than 10% frequency. In conclusion, NGS analysis of a cluster of HCV infections acquired in the hospital setting revealed the presence of low diversity, very closely related variants in all patients, suggesting an early-stage infection with the same virus. NGS combined with phylogenetic analysis and classical epidemiological analysis could help in tracking of HCV outbreaks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Next-generation sequencing analysis of a cluster of hepatitis C virus infections in a haematology and oncology center</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194816</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194816</originId><fingerprint>9f4e8b</fingerprint><author><name>Kamila Caraballo Cortes</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194816</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b7:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kamila Caraballo Cortes, Magdalena Rosińska, Maciej Janiak, Małgorzata Stępień, Osvaldo Zagordi, Karol Perlejewski, Sylwia Osuch, Agnieszka Pawełczyk, Iwona Bukowska-Ośko, Rafał Płoski, Piotr Grabarczyk, Tomasz Laskus, Marek Radkowski&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The aim of this investigation was to analyze the influence of the genetic variations of the -163C&gt;A polymorphism of the CYP1A2 gene on the ergogenic effects of caffeine in elite basketball players.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Nineteen elite basketball players (10 men and 9 women) ingested 3 mg⋅kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of caffeine or a placebo 60 min before performing 10 repetitions of the following series: the Abalakov jump test followed by the Change-of-Direction and Acceleration Test (CODAT). The players then competed in a 20-min simulated basketball game. Self-perceived performance and side effects were recorded by questionnaires after the trials. The effects of caffeine on basketball performance were established according to players’ CYP1A2 genotype (rs762551): AA homozygotes (n = 10) and C-allele carriers (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the 10 repetitions, caffeine increased Abalakov jump height by a mean of 2.9±3.6% in AA homozygotes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) while this effect did not reach statistical significance for C-allele carriers (2.3 ± 6.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.33). Caffeine did not affect sprint time in the CODAT test in either genotype group but it increased the number of impacts performed during the simulated game in both AA homozygotes (4.1 ± 5.3%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) and C-allele carriers (3.3 ± 3.2%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01). During the 24 h following the test, AA homozygotes tended to experience increased insomnia with caffeine while C-allele carriers did not present this effect.

Hyperopia is a common refractive error, apparent in 25% of Europeans. Treatments include spectacles, contact lenses, laser interventions and surgery including implantable contact lenses and lens extraction. Laser treatment offers an expedient and reliable means of correcting ametropia. LASIK is well-established however SMILE (small-incision lenticule extraction) or lenticule implantation (derived from myopic laser-correction) are newer options. In this study we compared the outcomes of hyperopic LASIK, SMILE and lenticule re-implantation in a primate model at +2D/+4D treatment. While re-implantation showed the greatest regression, broadly comparable refractive results were seen at 3-months with SMILE and LASIK (&amp;lt;1.4D of intended), but a greater tendency to regression in +2D lenticule reimplantation. Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Hyperopic refractive correction by LASIK, SMILE or lenticule reimplantation in a non-human primate model</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</originId><fingerprint>11fd5c8c</fingerprint><author><name>Geraint P.

Individuals with low levels of education systematically have worse health than those with medium or high levels of education. Yet there are few examples of attempts to summarize the evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions targeting health-related behavior among individuals with low education levels, and a large part of the literature is descriptive rather than analytical. A rapid review was carried out to examine the impact of such interventions. Special attention was given to the relative impact of the interventions among individuals with low education levels and their potential to reduce health inequality. Of 1,365 articles initially identified, only 31 were deemed relevant for the review, and of those, nine met the inclusion and quality criteria. The comparability of included studies was limited due to differences in study design, sample characteristics, and definitions of exposure and outcome variables. Therefore, instead of performing a formal meta-analysis, an overall assessment of the available evidence was made and summarized into some general conclusions. We found no support for the notion that the methods used to reduce smoking decrease inequalities in health between educational groups. Evidence was also limited for decreasing inequality through interventions regarding dietary intake, physical activity and mental health. Only one study was found using an intervention designed to decrease socioeconomic inequalities by increasing the use of breast cancer screening. Thus, we concluded that there is a lack of support regarding this type of intervention as well. Therefore, the main conclusion is that solid evidence is lacking for interventions aimed at individual determinants of health and that more research is needed to fill this gap in knowledge.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Reducing health inequalities with interventions targeting behavioral factors among individuals with low levels of education - A rapid review</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195774</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195774</originId><fingerprint>2962fae8</fingerprint><author><name>Andreas Vilhelmsson</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195774</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523912400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae0:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Vilhelmsson, Per-Olof Östergren&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, the main conclusion is that solid evidence is lacking for interventions aimed at individual determinants of health and that more research is needed to fill this gap in knowledge.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523912400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195774</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled></item><item><title>[ASAP] Simulation-Guided Design of Cytochrome P450 for Chemo- and Regioselective Macrocyclic Oxidation</title><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.8b00043/20180322/images/medium/ci-2018-000438_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00043&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Conclusion: Therefore, we suggest using F-measure optimization instead of placing an arbitrary threshold to evaluate the significance of Gene Ontology Enrichment results, and using resampling to replace analytical methods.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/218248v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>9fcaf994</fingerprint><author><name>Ge, W.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/218248v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522393200000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1627901be6d:7dba64e:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/218248v2?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/218248</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522448580205</crawled></item><item><title>Faster, faster, faster</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1374-d?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>dd81c34f</fingerprint><author><name>Osborne, I.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between stone composition and single-energy noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) parameters, including stone heterogeneity index (SHI) and mean stone density (MSD), in patients with urinary calculi. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 255 patients who underwent operations or procedures for urinary stones or had spontaneous stone passage between December 2014 and October 2015. Among these, 214 patients with urinary calculi who underwent NCCT and stone composition analyses were included in the study. Maximal stone length (MSL), mean stone density (MSD), and stone heterogeneity index (SHI) were determined on pretreatment NCCT. The mean MSD (454.68±177.80 HU) and SHI (115.82±96.31 HU) of uric acid stones were lower than those of all other types. Based on post hoc tests, MSD was lower for uric acid stones than for the other types (vs. CaOx: P&amp;lt;0.001; vs. infection stones: P&amp;lt;0.001). SHI was lower for uric acid stones than for the other types (vs. CaOx: P&amp;lt;0.001; vs. infection stones: P&amp;lt;0.001) Receiver operating characteristic curves of uric acid stones for MSD and SHI demonstrated that SHI (cut-off value: 140.4 HU) was superior to MSD (cut-off value: 572.3 HU) in predicting uric acid stones (P&amp;lt;0.001).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Stone heterogeneity index on single-energy noncontrast computed tomography can be a positive predictor of urinary stone composition</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193945</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193945</originId><fingerprint>a9b18625</fingerprint><author><name>Jong Soo Lee</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193945</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7124:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jong Soo Lee, Kang Su Cho, Seung Hwan Lee, Young Eun Yoon, Dong Hyuk Kang, Won Sik Jeong, Hae Do Jung, Jong Kyou Kwon, Joo Yong Lee&lt;/p&gt;

It is now well accepted that radiation induced bystander effects can occur in cells exposed to media from irradiated cells. The aim of this study was to follow the bystander cells in real time following addition of media from irradiated cells and to determine the effect of inhibiting these signals. A human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells, was irradiated (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy) with γ irradiation, conditioned medium was harvested after one hour and added to recipient bystander cells. Reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, Glutathione levels, caspase activation, cytotoxicity and cell viability was measured after the addition of irradiated cell conditioned media to bystander cells. Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide levels in bystander cells treated with 0.5Gy ICCM were analysed in real time using time lapse fluorescence microscopy. The levels of reactive oxygen species were also measured in real time after the addition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathway inhibitors. ROS and glutathione levels were observed to increase after the addition of irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). Caspase activation was found to increase 4 hours after irradiated cell conditioned media treatment (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM) and this increase was observed up to 8 hours and there after a reduction in caspase activation was observed. A decrease in cell viability was observed but no major change in cytotoxicity was found in HaCaT cells after treatment with irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). This study involved the identification of key signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, glutathione and caspases generated in bystander cells. These results suggest a clear connection between reactive oxygen species and cell survival pathways with persistent production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in bystander cells following exposure to irradiated cell conditioned media.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signaling in bystander cells</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195371</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195371</originId><fingerprint>dc124b60</fingerprint><author><name>Kishore Kumar Jella</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195371</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4619:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kishore Kumar Jella, Roisin Moriarty, Brendan McClean, Hugh J.

A decrease in cell viability was observed but no major change in cytotoxicity was found in HaCaT cells after treatment with irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). This study involved the identification of key signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, glutathione and caspases generated in bystander cells. These results suggest a clear connection between reactive oxygen species and cell survival pathways with persistent production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in bystander cells following exposure to irradiated cell conditioned media.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195371</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inhibitory gain modulation of defense behaviors by zona incerta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory gain modulation of defense behaviors by zona incerta, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03581-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03581-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Zona incerta (ZI) is an inhibitory subthalamic nucleus with diverse connectivity yet its functional importance has not been extensively studied.

To understand translational capacity on a genome-wide scale across three developmental stages of immature soybean seed cotyledons, ribosome profiling was performed in combination with RNA sequencing and cluster analysis. Transcripts representing 216 unique genes demonstrated a higher level of translational activity in at least one stage by exhibiting higher translational efficiencies (TEs) in which there were relatively more ribosome footprint sequence reads mapping to the transcript than were present in the control total RNA sample. The majority of these transcripts were more translationally active at the early stage of seed development and included 12 unique serine or cysteine proteases and 16 2S albumin and low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins that may serve as substrates for turnover and mobilization early in seed development. It would appear that the serine proteases and 2S albumins play a vital role in the early stages. In contrast, our investigation of profiles of 19 genes encoding high abundance seed storage proteins, such as glycinins, beta-conglycinins, lectin, and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors, showed that they all had similar patterns in which the TE values started at low levels and increased approximately 2 to 6-fold during development. The highest levels of these seed protein transcripts were found at the mid-developmental stage, whereas the highest ribosome footprint levels of only up to 1.6 TE were found at the late developmental stage. These experimental findings suggest that the major seed storage protein coding genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level during normal soybean cotyledon development. Finally, our analyses also identified a total of 370 unique gene models that showed very low TE values including over 48 genes encoding ribosomal family proteins and 95 gene models that are related to energy and photosynthetic functions, many of which have homology to the chloroplast genome. Additionally, we showed that genes of the chloroplast were relatively translationally inactive during seed development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Ribosome profiling reveals changes in translational status of soybean transcripts during immature cotyledon development</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194596</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194596</originId><fingerprint>57a0e3b8</fingerprint><author><name>Md.

A coproduction tests of quaternary (Q) phase(6CaO·4Al2O3·MgO·SiO2) -3CaO·3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cement clinker and an experimental study on the relationship between the mineral production capability and the physiochemical properties are conducted in a two-stage multiphase reaction test bed with Changguang coal. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analyses are performed on the coproduction clinker samples. The results demonstrate that, with the reduction in particle sizes of the coal powder and the additives and expanded screening level differences between them, both the proportion of Q phase and the mass of 3CaO·3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the clinker increase accordingly. When mixed coal powder particles are prepared through reducing particle sizes and expanding screening level differences between coal powder and additives, the additives CaO and MgO are more likely to be enclosed by coal powder to form globular polymerized particles. In addition, this preparation aids in polymerization and promotes even distribution of CaO, MgO and coal minerals, thus facilitating clinker mineral formation reactions of inorganic substances in the mixed coal powder. Target minerals, such as 2CaO·SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Q phase, are found in both industrial high-calcium limestone and low-calcium limestone coproduction clinker samples. A diffraction peak of free CaO is also evident in both samples. Compared with a coproduction clinker sample of high-calcium limestone, that of low-calcium limestone exhibits higher diffraction peaks for 2CaO·SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Q phase. With the current state of the art, it is not yet the optimum choice to substitute CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for CaO in Q-phase cement clinker coproduction.

In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) digitization technique for natural objects, such as insects and plants. The key idea is to combine X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photographs to obtain both complicated 3D shapes and surface textures of target specimens. We measure a specimen by using an X-ray CT device and a digital camera to obtain a CT volumetric image (volume) and multiple photographs. We then reconstruct a 3D model by segmenting the CT volume and generate a texture by projecting the photographs onto the model. To achieve this reconstruction, we introduce a technique for estimating a camera position for each photograph. We also present techniques for merging multiple textures generated from multiple photographs and recovering missing texture areas caused by occlusion. We illustrate the feasibility of our 3D digitization technique by digitizing 3D textured models of insects and flowers. The combination of X-ray CT and a digital camera makes it possible to successfully digitize specimens with complicated 3D structures accurately and allows us to browse both surface colors and internal structures.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Digitization of natural objects with micro CT and photographs</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195852</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195852</originId><fingerprint>76ea1616</fingerprint><author><name>Takashi Ijiri</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195852</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d3:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ijiri, Hideki Todo, Akira Hirabayashi, Kenji Kohiyama, Yoshinori Dobashi&lt;/p&gt;

We aimed to determine the effects of levodopa medication on the performance of a repetitive pointing task while standing, and to investigate the optimal trial duration in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, and older adults. Seventeen individuals with Parkinson’s disease (5 freezers) and 9 older adults stood on force platforms for 30 s and 120 s while performing a bilateral repetitive pointing task, tracked by motion capture. Participants with Parkinson’s disease were assessed on and off medication and older adults were also assessed on separate days. The main findings were that: 1) on medication, participants with Parkinson’s exhibited greater center of pressure root mean square in the medial-lateral direction, greater velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions, and greater range in the medial-lateral direction than off medication; 2) longer trial durations resulted in greater center of pressure range in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and greater coefficient of variation in finger pointing on the least affected side; 3) Parkinson’s participants exhibited larger range in the medial-lateral direction compared to older adults; 4) off medication, freezers presented with less range and root mean square in the anterior-posterior direction than non-freezers; and 5) a correlation emerged between the freezing of gait questionnaire and pointing asymmetry and the coefficient of variation of pointing on the most affected side. Therefore, Parkinson’s medication may increase instability during a repetitive pointing task. Longer trials may provide a better depiction of sway by discriminating between those with and without neurological impairment. Individuals with Parkinson’s were less stable than older adults, supporting that they are at a greater risk for falls. The greater restrictive postural strategy in freezers compared to non-freezers is likely a factor that augments fall-risk. Lastly, the link between freezing of gait and upper-limb movement indicates that freezing may manifest first in the lower-limbs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Medication and trial duration influence postural and pointing parameters during a standing repetitive pointing task in individuals with Parkinson’s disease</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</originId><fingerprint>15afb55e</fingerprint><author><name>Deborah A.

The random forest model was also successfully applied to sparse training sets and out-of-sample prediction, suggesting its value in facilitating adoption of synthetic methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/186?rss=1</originId><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><fingerprint>85339ff8</fingerprint><author><name>Ahneman, D.

Background &lt;p&gt;With the greatest burden of infant undernutrition and morbidity in low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a need for suitable approaches to monitor infants in a simple, low-cost and effective manner. Anthropometry continues to play a major role in characterising growth and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a range of models to aid in identifying neonates at risk of malnutrition. We first adopted a logistic regression approach to screen for a composite neonatal morbidity, low and high body fat (BF%) infants. We then developed linear regression models for the estimation of neonatal fat mass as an assessment of body composition and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We fitted logistic regression models combining up to four anthropometric variables to predict composite morbidity and low and high BF% neonates. The greatest area under receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUC with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) for identifying composite morbidity was 0.740 (0.63, 0.85), resulting from the combination of birthweight, length, chest and mid-thigh circumferences. The AUCs (95% CI) for identifying low and high BF% were 0.827 (0.78, 0.88) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88), respectively.For identifying composite morbidity, BF% as measured via air displacement plethysmography showed strong predictive ability (AUC 0.786 (0.70, 0.88)), while birthweight percentiles had a lower AUC (0.695 (0.57, 0.82)). Birthweight percentiles could also identify low and high BF% neonates with AUCs of 0.792 (0.74, 0.85) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88). We applied a sex-specific approach to anthropometric estimation of neonatal fat mass, demonstrating the influence of the testing sample size on the final model performance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These models display potential for further development and evaluation in LMICs to detect infants in need of further nutritional management, especially where traditional methods of risk management such as birthweight for gestational age percentiles may be variable or non-existent, or unable to detect appropriately grown, low fat newborns.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>An anthropometric approach to characterising neonatal morbidity and body composition, using air displacement plethysmography as a criterion method</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195193</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195193</originId><fingerprint>a54b841f</fingerprint><author><name>Jacqueline Huvanandana</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195193</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522443600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c56:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jacqueline Huvanandana, Angela E.

We describe a computational model of social norms based on identifying values that a certain culture finds desirable such as dignity, generosity and politeness. The model quantifies these values in the form of Culture-Sanctioned Social Metrics (CSSMs) and treats social norms as the requirement to maximize these metrics from the perspective of the self, peers and public. This model can be used to create realistic social simulations, to explain or predict human behavior in specific scenarios, or as a component of robots or agents that need to interact with humans in specific social-cultural settings. We validate the model by using it to represent a complex deception scenario and showing that it can yield non-trivial insights such as the explanation of apparently irrational human behavior.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Towards a computational model of social norms</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195331</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195331</originId><fingerprint>d9e80a78</fingerprint><author><name>Ladislau Bölöni</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195331</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523480400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd89:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ladislau Bölöni, Taranjeet Singh Bhatia, Saad Ahmad Khan, Jonathan Streater, Stephen M.

Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Identification of aaNAT5b as a spermine N-acetyltransferase in the mosquito, &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</originId><fingerprint>ff4d936c</fingerprint><author><name>Huai Guan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521493200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fe:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co- and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. Sera were fractionated, randomly applied to protein chip arrays (IMAC, CM10 and H50) and spectra were generated at low and high laser intensities.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Sixteen biomarkers achieved a p value &amp;lt; 0.01 (ROC values &gt; 0.75 or &amp;lt; 0.25) predictive of fibrosis status in co-infected individuals and 14 in mono infected subjects. Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono- and co-infected subjects.

Background &lt;p&gt;This is the first report to characterize the prevalence and genovar distribution of genital chlamydial infections among random heterosexual patients in the multi-ethnic Saratov Region, located in Southeast Russia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixty-one clinical samples (cervical or urethral swabs) collected from a random cohort of 856 patients (7.1%) were &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT) positive in commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and duplex TaqMan PCRs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Sequence analysis of the VDII region of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene revealed seven genovars of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; in PCR-positive patients. The overall genovars were distributed as E (41.9%), G (21.6%), F (13.5%), K (9.5%), D (6.8%), J (4.1%), and H (2.7%). CT-positive samples were from males (n = 12, 19.7%), females (n = 42, 68.8%), and anonymous (n = 7, 11.5%) patients, with an age range of 19 to 45 years (average 26.4), including 12 different ethnic groups representative of this region. Most patients were infected with a single genovar (82%), while 18% were co-infected with either two or three genovars. The 1156 bp-fragment of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene was sequenced in 46 samples to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among isolates. SNP-based subtyping and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of 13 variants of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene, such as E (E1, E2, E6), G (G1, G2, G3, G5), F1, K, D (D1, Da2), J1, and H2. Differing genovar distribution was identified among urban (E&gt;G&gt;F) and rural (E&gt;K) populations, and in Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;D) and non-Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;K) ethnic groups. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) determined five sequences types (STs), such as ST4 (56%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 70.0 to 41.3), ST6 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3), ST9 (22%, 95% CI 35.9 to 11.5), ST10 (2%, 95% CI 10.7 to 0.05) and ST38 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3).

The microtubule associated protein tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that tau also plays a role in disorders of neuronal connectivity, including epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Animal studies have shown that the MAPT gene, which codes for the tau protein, undergoes complex pre-mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms during brain development. Human data, particularly on temporal and regional variation in tau splicing during development are however lacking. In this study, we present the first detailed examination of the temporal and regional sequence of MAPT alternative splicing in the developing human brain. We used a novel computational analysis of large transcriptomic datasets (total n = 502 patients), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting to examine tau expression and splicing in post-mortem human fetal, pediatric and adult brains. We found that MAPT exons 2 and 10 undergo abrupt shifts in expression during the perinatal period that are unique in the canonical human microtubule-associated protein family, while exon 3 showed small but significant temporal variation. Tau isoform expression may be a marker of neuronal maturation, temporally correlated with the onset of axonal growth. Immature brain regions such as the ganglionic eminence and rhombic lip had very low tau expression, but within more mature regions, there was little variation in tau expression or splicing. We thus demonstrate an abrupt, evolutionarily conserved shift in tau isoform expression during the human perinatal period that may be due to tau expression in maturing neurons. Alternative splicing of the &lt;i&gt;MAPT&lt;/i&gt; pre-mRNA may play a vital role in normal brain development across multiple species and provides a basis for future investigations into the developmental and pathological functions of the tau protein.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>High-resolution temporal and regional mapping of &amp;lt;i&gt;MAPT&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression and splicing in human brain development</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195771</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195771</originId><fingerprint>a123f70e</fingerprint><author><name>Marco M.

Animal studies have shown that the MAPT gene, which codes for the tau protein, undergoes complex pre-mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms during brain development. Human data, particularly on temporal and regional variation in tau splicing during development are however lacking. In this study, we present the first detailed examination of the temporal and regional sequence of MAPT alternative splicing in the developing human brain. We used a novel computational analysis of large transcriptomic datasets (total n = 502 patients), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting to examine tau expression and splicing in post-mortem human fetal, pediatric and adult brains. We found that MAPT exons 2 and 10 undergo abrupt shifts in expression during the perinatal period that are unique in the canonical human microtubule-associated protein family, while exon 3 showed small but significant temporal variation. Tau isoform expression may be a marker of neuronal maturation, temporally correlated with the onset of axonal growth. Immature brain regions such as the ganglionic eminence and rhombic lip had very low tau expression, but within more mature regions, there was little variation in tau expression or splicing. We thus demonstrate an abrupt, evolutionarily conserved shift in tau isoform expression during the human perinatal period that may be due to tau expression in maturing neurons. Alternative splicing of the &lt;i&gt;MAPT&lt;/i&gt; pre-mRNA may play a vital role in normal brain development across multiple species and provides a basis for future investigations into the developmental and pathological functions of the tau protein.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195771</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled></item><item><title>Silicon sheds its harmonicity</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-b?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>cdf5466f</fingerprint><author><name>Grocholski, B.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-b?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523554636000</published><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fececb:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-b?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/167.2.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556775856</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Forced-rupture of cell-adhesion complexes reveals abrupt switch between two brittle states</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011056?af=R</originId><fingerprint>d549783b</fingerprint><author><name>Ngo Minh Toan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011056?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1520387556000</published><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88de:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011056?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522221443430</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stephen Baldwin, Robert J.

Recent advances in culture-free microbiological techniques bring new understanding of the role of intestinal microbiota in heath and performance. Intestinal microbial communities in chickens assume a near-stable state within the week which leaves a very small window for permanent microbiota remodelling. It is the first colonisers that determine the fate of microbial community in humans and birds alike, and after the microbiota has matured there are very small odds for permanent modification as stable community resists change. In this study we inoculated broiler chicks immediately post hatch, with 3 species of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA and pheS genes as &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;reuteri&lt;/i&gt;. The strains were isolated from the gut of healthy chickens as reproducibly persistent &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; strains among multiple flocks. Birds inoculated with the probiotic mix reached significantly higher weight by 28 days of age. Although each strain was able to colonise when administered alone, administering the probiotic mix at-hatch resulted in colonisation by only &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt;. High initial abundance of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt; was slowly reducing, however, the effects of at-hatch administration of the &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; mix on modifying microbiota development and structure remained persistent.

Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective. This study provides the groundwork for future studies concerning NMT-transcript-binding miRNAs, and will potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several important diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;In silico&amp;lt;/i&gt; identification of microRNAs predicted to regulate N-myristoyltransferase and Methionine Aminopeptidase 2 functions in cancer and infectious diseases</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194612</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194612</originId><fingerprint>d2096ec8</fingerprint><author><name>Ranjit Chauhan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194612</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5e9:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ranjit Chauhan, David Datzkiw, Shailly Varma Shrivastav, Anuraag Shrivastav&lt;/p&gt;

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are becoming routinely used for the detection of novel and clinically actionable DNA variants at a pangenomic scale. Such analyses are now used in the clinical practice to enable precision medicine. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are still one of the most abundant source of cancer clinical specimen, unfortunately this method of preparation is known to degrade DNA and therefore compromise subsequent analysis. Some studies have reported that variant detection can be performed on FFPE samples sequenced with NGS techniques, but few or none have done an in-depth coverage analysis and compared the influence of different state-of-the-art FFPE DNA extraction kits on the quality of the variant calling. Here, we generated 42 human whole-exome sequencing data sets from fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE samples. These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). We determined the rate of concordance of called variants between matched FF and FFPE samples on all common variants (representing at least 86% of the total number of variants for SNVs). The concordance rate is very high between all matched FF / FFPE pairs, with equivalent values for the three kits we analyzed. On the other hand, when looking at the difference between the total number of variants in FF and FFPE, we find a significant variation for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but statistically significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Performance comparison of three DNA extraction kits on human whole-exome data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal and tumor samples</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</originId><fingerprint>d03d05e</fingerprint><author><name>Eric Bonnet</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d736:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Bonnet, Marie-Laure Moutet, Céline Baulard, Delphine Bacq-Daian, Florian Sandron, Lilia Mesrob, Bertrand Fin, Marc Delépine, Marie-Ange Palomares, Claire Jubin, Hélène Blanché, Vincent Meyer, Anne Boland, Robert Olaso, Jean-François Deleuze&lt;/p&gt;

Compensatory growth (CG), an accelerated growth phenomenon which occurs following a period of dietary restriction is utilised worldwide in animal production systems as a management practise to lower feed costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of jejunal epithelial to CG in cattle through transcriptional profiling following a period of dietary restriction as well as subsequent re-alimentation induced CG. Sixty Holstein Friesian bulls were separated into two groups; RES and ADLIB, with 30 animals in each. RES animals were offered a restricted diet for 125 days (Period 1) followed by &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; feeding for 55 days (Period 2). ADLIB animals had &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; access to feed across both periods 1 and 2. At the end of each period, 15 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered, jejunal epithelium collected and RNAseq analysis performed. Animals that were previously diet restricted underwent CG, gaining 1.8 times the rate of their non-restricted counterparts. Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed in RES compared to ADLIB animals at the end of Period 1, with only one gene, &lt;i&gt;GSTA1&lt;/i&gt;, differentially expressed between the two groups at the end of Period 2. When analysed within treatment (RES, Period 2 v Period 1), 31 genes were differentially expressed between diet restricted and animals undergoing CG. Dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation were associated with altered expression of genes involved in digestion and metabolism as well as those involved in cellular division and growth. Compensatory growth was also associated with greater expression of genes involved in cellular protection and detoxification in jejunal epithelium. This study highlights some of the molecular mechanisms regulating the response to dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation induced CG in cattle; however the gene expression results suggest that most of the CG in jejunal epithelium had occurred by day 55 of re-alimentation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Effect of dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation on the transcriptional profile of bovine jejunal epithelium</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194445</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194445</originId><fingerprint>5dbf6264</fingerprint><author><name>Kate Keogh</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194445</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521493200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fb:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kate Keogh, Sinead M.

Metagenomics is a powerful tool for characterizing viral composition within environmental samples, but sample and molecular processing steps can bias the estimation of viral community structure. The objective of this study is to understand the inherent variability introduced when conducting viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater and provide a bioinformatic strategy to accurately analyze sequences for viral community analyses. A standard approach using a combination of ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, and DNase treatment, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) produced DNA preparations without any bacterial derived genes. Results showed recoveries in wastewater matrix ranged between 60–100%. A bias towards small single stranded DNA (ssDNA; polyomavirus) virus types vs larger double stranded DNA (dsDNA; adenovirus) viruses was also observed with a total estimated recovery of small circular viruses to be as much as 173-fold higher. Notably, ssDNA abundance decreased with sample dilution while large dsDNA genomes (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Caudovirales&lt;/i&gt;) initially increased in abundance with dilution before gradually decreasing with further dilution in wastewater samples. The present study revealed the inherent biases associated with different components of viral metagenomic methods applied to wastewater. Overall, these results provide a well-characterized approach for effectively conducting viral metagenomics analysis of wastewater and reveal that dilution can effectively mitigate MDA bias.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Reducing inherent biases introduced during DNA viral metagenome analyses of municipal wastewater</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195350</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195350</originId><fingerprint>433d97fb</fingerprint><author><name>Nichole E.

Antennal sensory units in nymphs and adults of the spotted Lanternfly, &lt;i&gt;Lycorma delicatula&lt;/i&gt; (White) (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Fulgoridae), an economically important plant pest, are studied with scanning electron microscopy.

The flagellum Bourgoin’s organ is a complex sensory unit with 2–3 internal sensilla coeloconica. During nymphal stages, the sensory surface available for a chemoreceptive function particularly increases with the number and size of sensilla placodea on the antennal pedicel. From first to fourth instar and to adult males and females, plate organ sensory surface is estimated to increase respectively by 33x, 68x and 125x (= 2.72 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.02 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively for males and females).

Thirteen variants (13/128, 10%) were ultimately classified as pathogenic. Most deaths (63%) occurred during sleep. Gene variant carriage was more likely with a positive medical history (mostly seizures, 63% vs 36%, p = 0.01), amongst females (36% vs 12%, p = 0.001) and whites more than Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Children 1–12 years were more likely to be gene-positive (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Family screening identified 42 gene-positive relatives, 18 with definitive phenotypic expression of LQTS/Brugada. 76% of the variants were maternally inherited (p = 0.007).

A rare variant in LQTS genes is more likely in whites rather than Maori, females, children 1–12 years and those with a positive personal and family history of seizures, syncope or SUDY.

Recent data suggest the existence of a complement alternative pathway activation in the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a condition that remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Hypocomplementemia is associated with worse renal survival in ANCA-positive granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</originId><fingerprint>f834d69c</fingerprint><author><name>Samuel Deshayes</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d74c:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Deshayes, Achille Aouba, Kathy Khoy, Delphine Mariotte, Thierry Lobbedez, Nicolas Martin Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Based on this result, we used TANDEM, a method for drug response prediction, to identify which variables predictive of drug response were distinct to either gene expression or proteomics.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293993v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>bbaa1599</fingerprint><author><name>Aben, N.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293993v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522738800000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1628d42a564:97c97a5:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293993v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/03/293993</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522788377956</crawled></item><item><content><content>It has been unclear whether superoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide play important roles in the phenomenon of obligate anaerobiosis.

Background &lt;p&gt;Since 1946 the controlled human infection model (CHIM) for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; has been used to improve understanding of disease pathogenesis, describe clinical and immunologic responses to infection and as a tool for vaccine development. As the frequency and intent for use in vaccine comparisons increases, standardization of the primary endpoint definition is necessary.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subject-level data were obtained from previously conducted experimental &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM studies. Signs and symptoms severity were categorized consistently across all studies. Sign and symptom correlations were estimated and univariate models were utilized to describe the association between stool output and other &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt;-attributable signs and symptoms. Multiple correspondence and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed to describe the co-occurrence of signs and symptoms. A disease score is proposed based on the co-occurrence of these events.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data were obtained on 54 subjects receiving 800 to 2000 colony forming units (cfu) of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt;. The median maximum 24 hour stool output was 514 ml (IQR: 300, 998 ml) with a median frequency of 6 (IQR: 4, 9). Subjects reported abdominal pain or cramps (81.5%), headache (66.7%) and anorexia (64.8%), 50.0% had a fever and 27.8% had gross blood in multiple loose stools. Multiple correspondence analyses highlighted co-occurrence of symptoms based on severity. A 3-parameter disease severity score predicted shigellosis endpoints and better differentiated disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Dichotomous endpoints for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM fail to fully account for disease variability. An ordinal disease score characterizing the breadth of disease severity may enable a better characterization of shigellosis and can decrease sample size requirements.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;HIV-1 dual infection is a condition that results from infection with at least two HIV-1 variants from different sources. The scarceness of information on this condition is partly due to the fact that its detection is technically challenging. Using next-generation sequencing we defined the extent of HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM).&lt;/p&gt; Material &amp;amp; methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six MSM, diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B infection between 2008 and 2013 were selected for next-generation sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;envelope&lt;/i&gt; V3. Sequencing was performed on 2 plasma samples collected with an interval of &gt; 6 months before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inspected for dual infection, defined as the presence of two or more monophyletic clusters with ≥ 90% bootstrap support and a mean between-cluster genetic distance of ≥ 10%. To confirm dual infection, deep V3 sequencing of intermediate samples was performed as well as clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;protease-reverse transcriptase&lt;/i&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five of the 74 patients (6.8%) for whom deep sequencing was successful, showed clear evidence of dual infection. In 4 of them, the second strain was absent in the first sample but occurred in subsequent samples. This was highly suggestive for superinfection. In 3 patients both virus variants were of subtype B, in 2 patients at least one of the variants was a subtype B/non-B recombinant virus.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Dual infection was confirmed in 6.8% of MSM diagnosed with HIV-1 in Belgium.

Accelerating IGF-IR endocytosis via IRS-1 depletion induces the shift from sustained to transient Akt activation and augments FoxO-mediated transcription.

Our study establishes a new role for IRS-1 as an endocytic regulator of IGF-IR that ensures sustained IGF bioactivity, independent of its classic role as an adaptor in IGF-IR signaling.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1523404800000</published><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162d30fda3e:309764d:34f43e70</id><engagement>31</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32893</link><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32893</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523959454270</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;East Asia braces for surge in deadly tick-borne virus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;East Asia braces for surge in deadly tick-borne virus, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04486-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04486-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rapid rise in number of infections and high fatality rate concern researchers.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>East Asia braces for surge in deadly tick-borne virus</title><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;East Asia braces for surge in deadly tick-borne virus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;East Asia braces for surge in deadly tick-borne virus, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04486-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04486-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rapid rise in number of infections and high fatality rate concern researchers.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04486-6</originId><engagementRate>0.37</engagementRate><fingerprint>815c7772</fingerprint><author><name>David Cyranoski</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04486-6</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523602800000</published><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162bf9daf27:16b2205:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>201</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04486-6</link><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04486-6/d41586-018-04486-6_15632296.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1523633205031</crawled></item><item><title>[ASAP] Crystal Structures of Cystathionine ß-Synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae: One Enzymatic Step at a Time</title><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00092/20180413/images/medium/bi-2018-00092r_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00092&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Sorghum (&lt;i&gt;Sorghum bicolor&lt;/i&gt;) extract is traditionally used as red biocolorant in West Africa to colour foods, among which &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt;, a soft cheese. This biocolorant is a source of the phytoalexin apigeninidin and phenolic acids, and users claim that it has preservative effects next to its colouring properties. If such a claim can be scientifically substantiated, it adds a valuable functional property to this natural red colorant, thereby increasing its potential applications in the food industry. Hence, the present study evaluated the antimicrobial properties of dye sorghum extracts using challenge tests in broth and &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt; as a model of a popular food application. The alkaline extract and hot aqueous extract were used for dyeing &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt; by 87.7% and 12.3% of the traders, respectively. The dyeing procedure is perceived as a preservation strategy, and is also a means to maximise the revenues. However, results demonstrated that the application of sorghum biocolorant on &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt; had no inhibitory effect on the growth of fungi (&lt;i&gt;Penicillium chrysogenum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cladosporium macrocarpum&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7. Furthermore, sorghum biocolorant in broth had no effect on growth of &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7. Consequently, the commonly used extracts for colouring soft West-African cheese did not show a preservative effect. In addition, dyeing did not affect the physico-chemical properties of &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt;. Still, the red colour hampered visual detection of microbial growth, thus clarifying the preservative effect reported by users.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Antimicrobial evaluation of red, phytoalexin-rich sorghum food biocolorant</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194657</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194657</originId><fingerprint>e29f6ef7</fingerprint><author><name>Folachodé U.

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world’s largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Eleven quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows with cloud computing</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005994</link><recrawled>1522355043476</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005994</originId><fingerprint>1848664e</fingerprint><author><name>Brian S.

In recent years, entrepreneurship has been gaining more prominence as a potential tool for solving poverty in developing countries. This paper mainly examines the relationship between farmer entrepreneurship and rural poverty alleviation in China by assessing the contribution of farm entrepreneurs towards overcoming poverty. Data were collected from 309 employees of farmer entrepreneurships in Guangxi Province through survey questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct an analysis of the effects of three identified capabilities of farm entrepreneurs—economic, educational and knowledge, and socio-cultural capabilities—on attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth and the qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship and how these in turn affect rural poverty, using AMOS 21. The findings show that socio-cultural capability has the greatest influence on farmer entrepreneurship growth (β = 0.50, p&amp;lt;0.001). The qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship also more significantly impacts rural poverty (β = 0.69, p&amp;lt;0.001) than attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth. This study suggests that policy makers in China should involve more rural farmers in the targeted poverty alleviation strategies of the government by equipping rural farmers with entrepreneurial skills. This can serve as a sustainable, bottom-up approach to alleviating rural poverty in remote areas of the country. The study also extends the literature on the farmer entrepreneurship-rural poverty alleviation nexus in China, and this can serve as a lesson for other developing countries in the fight against rural poverty.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Does farmer entrepreneurship alleviate rural poverty in China?

Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease. We conducted a scoping review of child growth studies in which length/height, weight or body mass index (BMI) was measured at ≥ 2 time points. From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., ‘weight gain’) and a ‘content signature’, a numeric code that summarized the metric’s conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child’s change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels. In conclusion, the numerous distinct growth metrics and the lack of specificity in the application of metric labels challenge the integration of data and inferences from studies investigating the determinants or consequences of variations in childhood growth.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Metrics of early childhood growth in recent epidemiological research: A scoping review</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194565</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194565</originId><fingerprint>34cbd772</fingerprint><author><name>Michael Leung</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194565</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521579600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37b3:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Leung, Nandita Perumal, Elnathan Mesfin, Aditi Krishna, Seungmi Yang, William Johnson, Diego G.

The current study aimed to assess the potential of different exercises triggering an osteogenic response at the femoral neck in a group of postmenopausal women. The osteogenic potential was determined by ranking the peak hip contact forces (HCFs) and consequent peak tensile and compressive strains at the superior and inferior part of the femoral neck during activities such as (fast) walking, running and resistance training exercises. Results indicate that fast walking (5–6 km/h) running and hopping induced significantly higher strains at the femoral neck than walking at 4 km/h which is considered a baseline exercise for bone preservation. Exercises with a high fracture risk such as hopping, need to be considered carefully especially in a frail elderly population and may therefore not be suitable as a training exercise. Since superior femoral neck frailness is related to elevated hip fracture risk, exercises such as fast walking (above 5 km/h) and running can be highly recommended to stimulate this particular area. Our results suggest that a training program including fast walking (above 5 km/h) and running exercises may increase or preserve the bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Ranking of osteogenic potential of physical exercises in postmenopausal women based on femoral neck strains</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195463</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195463</originId><fingerprint>19023cab</fingerprint><author><name>Pim Pellikaan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195463</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522875600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57606:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pim Pellikaan, Georgios Giarmatzis, Jos Vander Sloten, Sabine Verschueren, Ilse Jonkers&lt;/p&gt;

We have previously characterized Pir32, a &lt;i&gt;Candia albicans&lt;/i&gt; cell wall protein that we found to be involved in filamentation, virulence, chitin deposition, and resistance to oxidative stress. Other than defining the cell shape, the cell wall is critical for the interaction with the surrounding environment and the point of contact and interaction with the host surface. In this study, we applied tandem mass spectrometry combined with bioinformatics to investigate cell wall proteome changes in a &lt;i&gt;pir32&lt;/i&gt; null strain. A total of 16 and 25 proteins were identified exclusively in the null mutant strains grown under non-filamentous and filamentous conditions. These proteins included members of the PGA family with various functions, lipase and the protease involved in virulence, superoxide dismutases required for resisting oxidative stress, alongside proteins required for cell wall remodeling and synthesis such as Ssr1, Xog1, Dfg5 and Dcw1. In addition proteins needed for filamentation like Cdc42, Ssu81 and Ucf1, and other virulence proteins such as Als3, Rbt5, and Csa2 were also detected. The detection of these proteins in the mutant and their lack of detection in the wild type can explain the differential phenotypes previously observed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Proteomic analysis of a &amp;lt;i&gt;Candida albicans pir32&amp;lt;/i&gt; null strain reveals proteins involved in adhesion, filamentation and virulence</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194403</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194403</originId><fingerprint>cbcdbf50</fingerprint><author><name>Pamela El Khoury</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194403</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521493200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f8:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pamela El Khoury, Andy Awad, Brigitte Wex, Roy A.

Despite the increasingly recognized importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a regulator of tumor progression, only few &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models have been developed to systematically study the effects of TME on tumor behavior in a controlled manner. Here we developed a three-dimensional (3D) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model that recapitulates the physical and compositional characteristics of Glioblastoma (GBM) extracellular matrix (ECM) and incorporates brain stromal cells such as astrocytes and endothelial cell precursors. The model was used to evaluate the effect of TME components on migration and survival of various patient-derived GBM cell lines (GBM10, GBM43 and GBAM1) in the context of STAT3 inhibition. Migration analysis of GBM within the 3D &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model demonstrated that the presence of astrocytes significantly increases the migration of GBM, while presence of endothelial precursors has varied effects on the migration of different GBM cell lines. Given the role of the tumor microenvironment as a regulator of STAT3 activity, we tested the effect of the STAT3 inhibitor SH-4-54 on GBM migration and survival. SH-4-54 inhibited STAT3 activity and reduced 3D migration and survival of GBM43 but had no effect on GBM10.

Despite the increasingly recognized importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a regulator of tumor progression, only few &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models have been developed to systematically study the effects of TME on tumor behavior in a controlled manner. Here we developed a three-dimensional (3D) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model that recapitulates the physical and compositional characteristics of Glioblastoma (GBM) extracellular matrix (ECM) and incorporates brain stromal cells such as astrocytes and endothelial cell precursors. The model was used to evaluate the effect of TME components on migration and survival of various patient-derived GBM cell lines (GBM10, GBM43 and GBAM1) in the context of STAT3 inhibition. Migration analysis of GBM within the 3D &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model demonstrated that the presence of astrocytes significantly increases the migration of GBM, while presence of endothelial precursors has varied effects on the migration of different GBM cell lines. Given the role of the tumor microenvironment as a regulator of STAT3 activity, we tested the effect of the STAT3 inhibitor SH-4-54 on GBM migration and survival. SH-4-54 inhibited STAT3 activity and reduced 3D migration and survival of GBM43 but had no effect on GBM10. SH-4-54 treatment drastically reduced the viability of the stem-like line GBAM1 in liquid culture, but its effect lessened in presence of a 3D ECM and stromal cells. Our results highlight the interplay between the ECM and stromal cells in the microenvironment with the cancer cells and indicate that the impact of these relationships may differ for GBM cells of varying genetic and clinical histories.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194183</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521740721801</crawled></item><item><content><content>The flow of cargo vesicles along the secretory pathway requires concerted action among various regulators.

The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the use of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions. One of the challenges of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotation is the uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network topology and structural similarity to improve &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury still represents a major concern in clinical transplantation, especially in the era of extreme organ shortage and extended criteria donor organs. In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240–340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;RIC 1 group showed significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Limb remote ischemic conditioning of the recipient protects the liver in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</originId><fingerprint>968614f6</fingerprint><author><name>Zoltan Czigany</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522875600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec7:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zoltan Czigany, Christian Bleilevens, Christian Beckers, Christian Stoppe, Michaela Möhring, Andras Fülöp, Attila Szijarto, Georg Lurje, Ulf P.

Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The farm cost of decreasing antimicrobial use in dairy production</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</originId><fingerprint>97dca45</fingerprint><author><name>Guillaume Lhermie</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b9:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Lhermie, Loren William Tauer, Yrjo Tapio Gröhn&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521741783044</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A large-scale survey of the postmortem human microbiome, and its potential to provide insight into the living health condition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale survey of the postmortem human microbiome, and its potential to provide insight into the living health condition, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23989-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23989-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A large-scale survey of the postmortem human microbiome, and its potential to provide insight into the living health condition&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/xl_TuBWNT9M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A large-scale survey of the postmortem human microbiome, and its potential to provide insight into the living health condition</title><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A large-scale survey of the postmortem human microbiome, and its potential to provide insight into the living health condition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale survey of the postmortem human microbiome, and its potential to provide insight into the living health condition, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23989-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23989-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A large-scale survey of the postmortem human microbiome, and its potential to provide insight into the living health condition&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/xl_TuBWNT9M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23989-w</originId><fingerprint>cd08c423</fingerprint><author><name>Jennifer L.

Explicit structural inference is one key point to improve the accuracy of scene parsing. Meanwhile, adversarial training method is able to reinforce spatial contiguity in output segmentations. To take both advantages of the structural learning and adversarial training simultaneously, we propose a novel deep learning network architecture called Structural Inference Embedded Adversarial Networks (SIEANs) for pixel-wise scene labeling. The generator of our SIEANs, a novel designed scene parsing network, makes full use of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks to learn the global contextual information of objects in four different directions from RGB-(D) images, which is able to describe the (three-dimensional) spatial distributions of objects in a more comprehensive and accurate way. To further improve the performance, we explore the adversarial training method to optimize the generator along with a discriminator, which can not only detect and correct higher-order inconsistencies between the predicted segmentations and corresponding ground truths, but also exploit full advantages of the generator by fine-tuning its parameters so as to obtain higher consistencies. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SIEANs is able to achieve a better performance on PASCAL VOC 2012, SIFT FLOW, PASCAL Person-Part, Cityscapes, Stanford Background, NYUDv2, and SUN-RGBD datasets compared to the most of state-of-the-art methods.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Structural inference embedded adversarial networks for scene parsing</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</originId><fingerprint>97df91ae</fingerprint><author><name>ZeYu Wang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7137:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by ZeYu Wang, YanXia Wu, ShuHui Bu, PengCheng Han, GuoYin Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

We investigated the effect of auditory noise added to speech on patterns of looking at faces in 40 toddlers. We hypothesised that noise would increase the difficulty of processing speech, making children allocate more attention to the mouth of the speaker to gain visual speech cues from mouth movements. We also hypothesised that this shift would cause a decrease in fixation time to the eyes, potentially decreasing the ability to monitor gaze. We found that adding noise increased the number of fixations to the mouth area, at the price of a decreased number of fixations to the eyes. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a mouth-eyes trade-off between attention allocated to social cues coming from the eyes and linguistic cues coming from the mouth. We also found that children with higher word recognition proficiency and higher average pupil response had an increased likelihood of fixating the mouth, compared to the eyes and the rest of the screen, indicating stronger motivation to decode the speech.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Auditory noise increases the allocation of attention to the mouth, and the eyes pay the price: An eye-tracking study</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194491</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194491</originId><fingerprint>4ebc6b18</fingerprint><author><name>Magdalena Ewa Król</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194491</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521579600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37ab:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena Ewa Król&lt;/p&gt;

With over 1 million species on earth, each biologically unique, do we have any hope of understanding whether species will persist in a warming world? We might, because it turns out that there is surprising regularity in how warming accelerates the major metabolic processes that power life. A persistent challenge has been to understand ecological effects of temperature in the context of species interactions, especially when individuals not only experience temperature but also mortality due to parasitism or predation. Kirk et al. have shown how the effects of parasites vary with warming in a manner entirely consistent with general temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/u5e7Nju7vII&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The metabolic theory of ecology and the cost of parasitism</title><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005628</link><recrawled>1522691102456</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005628</originId><fingerprint>f84e6dc5</fingerprint><author><name>Mary I.

The existing protein complex detection methods can be broadly divided into two categories: unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Most of the unsupervised learning methods assume that protein complexes are in dense regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks even though many true complexes are not dense subgraphs. Supervised learning methods utilize the informative properties of known complexes; they often extract features from existing complexes and then use the features to train a classification model. The trained model is used to guide the search process for new complexes.

The existing protein complex detection methods can be broadly divided into two categories: unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Most of the unsupervised learning methods assume that protein complexes are in dense regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks even though many true complexes are not dense subgraphs. Supervised learning methods utilize the informative properties of known complexes; they often extract features from existing complexes and then use the features to train a classification model. The trained model is used to guide the search process for new complexes. However, insufficient extracted features, noise in the PPI data and the incompleteness of complex data make the classification model imprecise. Consequently, the classification model is not sufficient for guiding the detection of complexes. Therefore, we propose a new robust score function that combines the classification model with local structural information. Based on the score function, we provide a search method that works both forwards and backwards. The results from experiments on six benchmark PPI datasets and three protein complex datasets show that our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for protein complex detection, occasionally significantly outperforming such methods.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194124</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521481331028</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dong Hyun Ryu, Yong Hun Jung, Kyung Woon Jeung, Byung Kook Lee, Young Won Jeong, Jong Geun Yun, Dong Hun Lee, Sung Min Lee, Tag Heo, Yong Il Min&lt;/p&gt;
Unrecognized endobronchial intubation frequently occurs after emergency intubation. However, no study has evaluated the effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We compared the hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during one-lung ventilation with those during conventional two-lung ventilation in a pig model of CPR, to determine the effect of the former on ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). However, no difference in ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was detected between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and oxygen saturation (SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) differed among the three types of ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, respectively).

However, the levels of these blood gases did not differ between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. In a pig model of CPR, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was significantly lower during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung ventilation. However, interestingly, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during left-lung ventilation was comparable to that during two-lung ventilation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a pig model of cardiac arrest</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195826</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195826</originId><fingerprint>7e96e08e</fingerprint><author><name>Dong Hyun Ryu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195826</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66cf:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dong Hyun Ryu, Yong Hun Jung, Kyung Woon Jeung, Byung Kook Lee, Young Won Jeong, Jong Geun Yun, Dong Hun Lee, Sung Min Lee, Tag Heo, Yong Il Min&lt;/p&gt;

Stock correlation networks use stock price data to explore the relationship between different stocks listed in the stock market. Currently this relationship is dominantly measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. However, financial data suggest that nonlinear relationships may exist in the stock prices of different shares. To address this issue, this work uses mutual information to characterize the nonlinear relationship between stocks. Using 280 stocks traded at the Shanghai Stocks Exchange in China during the period of 2014-2016, we first compare the effectiveness of the correlation coefficient and mutual information for measuring stock relationships. Based on these two measures, we then develop two stock networks using the Minimum Spanning Tree method and study the topological properties of these networks, including degree, path length and the power-law distribution. The relationship network based on mutual information has a better distribution of the degree and larger value of the power-law distribution than those using the correlation coefficient. Numerical results show that mutual information is a more effective approach than the correlation coefficient to measure the stock relationship in a stock market that may undergo large fluctuations of stock prices.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Development of stock correlation networks using mutual information and financial big data</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195941</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195941</originId><fingerprint>e2c8344f</fingerprint><author><name>Xue Guo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195941</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524085200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccbc:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xue Guo, Hu Zhang, Tianhai Tian&lt;/p&gt;

Land managers increasingly rely upon landscape assessments to understand the status of natural resources and identify conservation priorities. Many of these landscape planning efforts rely on geospatial models that characterize the ecological integrity of the landscape. These general models utilize measures of habitat disturbance and human activity to map indices of ecological integrity. We built upon these modeling frameworks by developing a Landscape Integrity Index (&lt;i&gt;LII&lt;/i&gt;) model using geospatial datasets of the human footprint, as well as incorporation of other indicators of ecological integrity such as biodiversity and vegetation departure. Our &lt;i&gt;LII&lt;/i&gt; model serves as a general indicator of ecological integrity in a regional context of human activity, biodiversity, and change in habitat composition.

We extract the most essential feedback loops from each model version and find differences between tissues, pointing to specific design principles within the hierarchy of mammalian tissue clocks.

Here we fit mathematical models to tissue-specific mammalian circadian gene expression profiles. For every investigated tissue multiple model parameter sets reproduce the experimental data. We extract the most essential feedback loops from each model version and find differences between tissues, pointing to specific design principles within the hierarchy of mammalian tissue clocks. Self-inhibitions of Per and Cry genes are characteristic for models of SCN clocks, while in liver models many loops act in synergy and are connected by a repressilator motif. Tissue-specific use of a network of co-existing synergistic feedback loops could account for functional differences between organs.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304451v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>ca60cdc8</fingerprint><author><name>Pett, J.

To elucidate the association between renal hyperfiltration (RHF) and incident proteinuria, the data from 11,559,520 Korean adults who had undergone health screenings ≥ 3 times between 2009 and 2014 and had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and negative dipstick test for proteinuria at baseline, were retrospectively analyzed. GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine, and RHF was defined as GFR &gt;95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile adjusted for sex, age, body size, and diabetes and/or hypertension medication. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of incident proteinuria in the RHF was 1.083 (95% CI, 1.069~1.097) compared to that of the non-RHF with Cox regression model. The association between RHF and incident proteinuria was not only in diabetic but also in non-diabetic subjects. This association was not observed in women (p for interaction &amp;lt;0.001). A reverse J-shaped association was found between the adjusted GFR slope and aHR of incident proteinuria. Both lower and higher GFR were associated with incident proteinuria in men. In conclusion, RHF was associated with incident proteinuria in men.

With the exploitation of offshore oil and gas gradually moving to deep water, higher temperature differences and pressure differences are applied to the pipeline system, making the global buckling of the pipeline more serious. For unburied deep-water pipelines, the lateral buckling is the major buckling form. The initial imperfections widely exist in the pipeline system due to manufacture defects or the influence of uneven seabed, and the distribution and geometry features of initial imperfections are random. They can be divided into two kinds based on shape: single-arch imperfections and double-arch imperfections. This paper analyzed the global buckling process of a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections by using a numerical simulation method and revealed how the ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength and the combination of imperfections affects the buckling process. The results show that a pipeline with 2 initial imperfections may suffer the superposition of global buckling. The growth ratios of buckling displacement, axial force and bending moment in the superposition zone are several times larger than no buckling superposition pipeline. The ratio of the initial imperfection’s space length to the imperfection’s wavelength decides whether a pipeline suffers buckling superposition. The potential failure point of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is as same as the no buckling superposition pipeline, but the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting buckling superposition is much higher. The shape and direction of two nearby imperfections also affects the failure risk of pipeline exhibiting global buckling superposition.

We document the development of non-proliferating intracellular amastigotes in vivo and in vitro in the absence of drug treatment. Non-proliferative amastigotes ultimately converted to trypomastigotes and established infections in new host cells.

Recent advances suggest that impairment in social cognition (SC) may play a role in the development of social anxiety (SA). However, very few studies have analyzed whether SA fosters poorer social-cognitive development as it leads to social avoidance. This study aimed to analyze whether retrospectively assessed behavioral inhibition (BI) (i.e., an early form of SA) in childhood is associated with a deficit in social cognition operationalized as impairment of mentalizing (MZ) in adolescence. A sample of 256 adolescents (range: 12–18 years; mean age: 14.7 years; &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 1.7) from general population were assessed for MZ capacities and retrospective BI through self-report and interview measures. Results comparing three groups of adolescents with different levels of childhood BI (low, moderate or high) and controlling for concurrent SA and depression reveal that the higher the level of BI, the lower the level of MZ. These results were consistent for almost all mentalization measures, including when both extreme (i.e., high vs. low BI) and non-extreme (i.e., high vs. moderate BI) were compared in both self-report and interview measures and in both dimensions of MZ (i.e., MZ referred to others’ and to own mental states). These findings support that childhood forms of SA are associated to deficit in SC in adolescence. A possible bi-directional relationship between SA and SC, and the role that it may play in the pathway to clinical SA are discussed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Childhood behavioral inhibition is associated with impaired mentalizing in adolescence</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</originId><fingerprint>e784a6d6</fingerprint><author><name>Sergi Ballespí</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde36:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sergi Ballespí, Ariadna Pérez-Domingo, Jaume Vives, Carla Sharp, Neus Barrantes-Vidal&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is considered a major worldwide health burden, with high mortality and associated costs. Health indicators are essential to define strategies to improve the treatment of diseases, and the epidemiology information of sepsis in developing countries is scarce. Thus, the aim of this work is to assess trends in the incidence, lethality, costs, and other indicators of sepsis for Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS—&lt;i&gt;Sistema Único de Saúde&lt;/i&gt;) hospitalizations for the period from January 2006 to December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted this study using data from the SUS hospital information system. We selected registries of SUS hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with sepsis (total of 724,458 cases from 4,271 public and private Brazilian hospitals).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2015, the annual sepsis incidence increased 50.5% from 31.5/100,000 to 47.4/100,000 persons. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 9.0 days. A total of 29.1% of the hospitalizations had admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a mean ICU LOS of 8.0 days. The mean cost per hospitalization was US$624.0 and for hospitalizations requiring intensive care was U$1,708.1. The overall sepsis lethality rate was 46.3%, and for hospitalizations with admission to the ICU, it was 64.5%. During the study period, the lethality rate for children/teenagers decreased 40.1%, but for all other age groups it increased 11.4%. The sepsis lethality rate in public hospitals (55.5%) was higher than private hospitals (37.0%) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The mean hospitalization LOS for public hospitals (10.3 days) was higher than private hospitals (7.6 days) (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incidence and lethality rate of sepsis increased in SUS hospitalizations during the study period.

Approximately 5.5% of homologous regions in the genomes exhibited H3K4me3 modification in either species, among which approximately 67% homologous regions exhibited sequence-dependent interspecies H3K4me3 variations.

The cold-water coral &lt;i&gt;Lophelia pertusa&lt;/i&gt; is an ecosystem engineer that builds reef structures on the seafloor. The interaction of the reef topography with hydrodynamics is known to enhance the supply of suspended food sources to the reef communities. However, the reef framework is also a substrate for other organisms that may compete for the very same suspended food sources. Here, we used the passive suspension feeder &lt;i&gt;Lophelia pertusa&lt;/i&gt; and the active suspension feeding sponge &lt;i&gt;Hymedesmia coriacea&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms to study niche overlap using isotopically-enriched algae and bacteria as suspended food sources. The coral and the sponge were fed with a combination of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched bacteria/&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-enriched algae or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-enriched bacteria/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched algae, which was subsequently traced into bulk tissue, coral skeleton and dissolved inorganic carbon (i.e. respiration). Both the coral and the sponge assimilated and respired the suspended bacteria and algae, indicating niche overlap between these species. The assimilation rates of C and N into bulk tissue of specimens incubated separately were not significantly different from assimilation rates during incubations with co-occurring corals and sponges. Hence, no evidence for exploitative resource competition was found, but this is likely due to the saturating experimental food concentration that was used. We do not rule out that exploitative competition occurs in nature during periods of low food concentrations. Food assimilation and respiration rates of the sponge were almost an order of magnitude higher than those of the cold-water coral. We hypothesize that the active suspension feeding mode of the sponge explains the observed differences in resource uptake as opposed to the passive suspension feeding mode of the cold-water coral. These feeding mode differences may set constraints on suitable habitats for cold-water corals and sponges in their natural habitats.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Niche overlap between a cold-water coral and an associated sponge for isotopically-enriched particulate food sources</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</originId><fingerprint>88bebd50</fingerprint><author><name>Dick van Oevelen</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5ee:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dick van Oevelen, Christina E.

Background &lt;p&gt;The incidence rate of breast cancer is increasing and has become the most common cancer in Vietnamese women while the survival rate is lower than that of developed countries. Early detection to improve breast cancer survival as well as reducing risk factors remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This study aims to evaluate the costs and outcomes of introducing a mammography screening program for Vietnamese women aged 45–64 years, compared to the current situation of no screening.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Decision analytical modeling using Markov chain analysis was used to estimate costs and health outcomes over a lifetime horizon. Model inputs were derived from published literature and the results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and/or incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs). One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The ICER per life year gained of the first round of mammography screening was US$3647.06 and US$4405.44 for women aged 50–54 years and 55–59 years, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, mammography screening in the 50–54 age group and the 55–59 age group were cost-effective in 100% of cases at a threshold of three times the Vietnamese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) i.e., US$6332.70.

The overall survival (OS) of patients with ovarian cancer is poor while epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinico-pathologic characteristics, especially the prognostic factors, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Taiwan. Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p&amp;lt;0.001, p = 0.020, p&amp;lt;0.001, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC. Personalized medicine may be needed for different histological types of EOC because of their different outcomes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Prognostic factors in epithelial ovarian cancer: A population-based study</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194993</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194993</originId><fingerprint>9df5e11f</fingerprint><author><name>Lin-Chau Chang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194993</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0aea:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin-Chau Chang, Chih-Fen Huang, Mei-Shu Lai, Li-Jiuan Shen, Fe-Lin Lin Wu, Wen-Fang Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

are commonly used in untargeted metabolomics, providing retention time, m/z
values and metabolite specific-fragments all of which are used to identify and validate
an unknown analyte. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is emerging as an
enhancement to classic xC-MS strategies, by offering additional separation as
well as collision cross section (CCS) determination. In order to apply such an
approach to a synthetic biology workflow, verified data from metabolite
standards is necessary. In this work we present experimental DTCCSN2
values for a range of metabolites in positive and negative ionisation modes
using drift time-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (DT-IM-MS) with nitrogen as the
buffer gas. Creating a useful database containing DTCCSN2
measurements for application in metabolite identification relies on a robust
technique that acquires measurements of high reproducibility. We report that 86%
of the metabolites measured in replicate have a relative standard deviation
lower than 0.2 %. Examples of
metabolites with near identical mass are demonstrated to be separated by ion
mobility with over 4% difference in DTCCSN2 values. We conclude
that the integration of ion mobility into current LC-MS workflows can aid in
small molecule identification for both targeted and untargeted metabolite
screening which is commonly performed in synthetic biology.</description><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Mobilising_Ion_Mobility_Mass_Spectrometry_in_a_Synthetic_Biology_Analytics_Workflow/6149204</originId><fingerprint>8707781f</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Mobilising_Ion_Mobility_Mass_Spectrometry_in_a_Synthetic_Biology_Analytics_Workflow/6149204</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>Chromatography based mass spectrometry approaches (xC-MS)

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Predictive value of the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in HBV-associated cirrhotic patients after splenectomy</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195336</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195336</originId><fingerprint>fd6c6806</fingerprint><author><name>Zhaoqing Du</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195336</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4612:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Genetic differences contribute to variations in the immune response mounted by different individuals to a pathogen. Such differential response can influence the spread of infectious disease, indicating why such diseases impact some populations more than others. Here, we study the impact of population-level genetic heterogeneity on the epidemic spread of different strains of H1N1 influenza. For a population with known HLA class-I allele frequency and for a given H1N1 viral strain, we classify individuals into sub-populations according to their level of susceptibility to infection. Our core hypothesis is that the susceptibility of a given individual to a disease such as H1N1 influenza is inversely proportional to the number of high affinity viral epitopes the individual can present. This number can be extracted from the HLA genetic profile of the individual. We use ethnicity-specific HLA class-I allele frequency data, together with genome sequences of various H1N1 viral strains, to obtain susceptibility sub-populations for 61 ethnicities and 81 viral strains isolated in 2009, as well as 85 strains isolated in other years. We incorporate these data into a multi-compartment SIR model to analyse the epidemic dynamics for these (ethnicity, viral strain) epidemic pairs. Our results show that HLA allele profiles which lead to a large spread in individual susceptibility values can act as a protective barrier against the spread of influenza. We predict that populations skewed such that a small number of highly susceptible individuals coexist with a large number of less susceptible ones, should exhibit smaller outbreaks than populations with the same average susceptibility but distributed more uniformly across individuals. Our model tracks some well-known qualitative trends of influenza spread worldwide, suggesting that HLA genetic diversity plays a crucial role in determining the spreading potential of different influenza viral strains across populations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x5hYH_0EN7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Role of genetic heterogeneity in determining the epidemiological severity of H1N1 influenza</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006069</link><recrawled>1521663840899</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006069</originId><fingerprint>f8123518</fingerprint><author><name>Narmada Sambaturu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/x5hYH_0EN7g/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521666000000</published><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16249acad20:4027a:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Narmada Sambaturu, Sumanta Mukherjee, Martín López-García, Carmen Molina-París, Gautam I.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an increasing public health concern because of rapid lifestyle changes. Although there have been previous studies on the prevalence of MS in China, the prevalence may have changed with lifestyle changes over the last decade. To update this prevalence, we performed a cross-sectional survey among adults over 18 years old across China from May 2013 to July 2014. Participants underwent questionnaires and provided blood and urine samples for analysis. MS was defined according to the criteria of the China Diabetes Society. A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively).

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an increasing public health concern because of rapid lifestyle changes. Although there have been previous studies on the prevalence of MS in China, the prevalence may have changed with lifestyle changes over the last decade. To update this prevalence, we performed a cross-sectional survey among adults over 18 years old across China from May 2013 to July 2014. Participants underwent questionnaires and provided blood and urine samples for analysis. MS was defined according to the criteria of the China Diabetes Society. A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively). The results of logistic regression analyses showed that age, urolithiasis, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, thiazide drugs intake, family history of diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR&gt;1). In addition, education, vitamin D intake and family history of urolithiasis are all protective factors (OR&amp;lt;1). Our results indicate that there was a high prevalence of MS in Chinese adults. Compared to the previous study 10 years ago, some preventive strategies have worked; however, further work on the prevention and treatment of MS remains necessary.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1524085200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524074227579</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Lipid diffusion in the distal and proximal leaflets of supported lipid bilayer membranes studied by single particle tracking</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010341?af=R</originId><fingerprint>b7132551</fingerprint><author><name>Rafael L.

Given the frequency with which MAP kinase signaling is dysregulated in cancer, much effort has been focused on inhibiting RAS signaling for therapeutic benefit. KSR1, a pseudokinase that interacts with RAF, is a potential target; it was originally cloned in screens for suppressors of constitutively active RAS, and its deletion prevents RAS-mediated transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In this work, we used a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer to assess whether KSR1 deletion would influence tumor development in the setting of oncogenic RAS. We found that &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice on this background had a modest but significant improvement in all-cause morbidity compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; cohorts. &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, however, still developed tumors, and precursor pancreatic intraepithelial neoplastic (PanIN) lesions were detected within a similar timeframe compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice. No significant differences in pERK expression or in proliferation were noted. RNA sequencing also did not reveal any unique genetic signature in &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumors.

I’ve written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoleamine_2,3-dioxygenase&quot;&gt;IDO&lt;/a&gt; inhibitors before, partly in the context of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/10/16/incyte-and-flexus-the-grappling-continues&quot;&gt;odd situation&lt;/a&gt; between Incyte and Flexus, and partly in response to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/06/08/why-did-this-ido-inhibitor-trial-fail&quot;&gt;failed trial&lt;/a&gt; of a compound from NewLink. That last one shook people up a bit, but (as I mentioned in the post) there was still hope for combination of the Incyte drug with Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The idea is that IDO inhibition would increase T-cell activity and add to Keytruda’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that is not the case. The companies have announced that the Phase III trial of this combination in melanoma has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/body-blow-for-incyte-as-merck-partnered-melanoma-trial-bombs&quot;&gt;utterly missed&lt;/a&gt; its endpoints, and that appears to be a massive setback for the whole idea. Add that to the earlier difficulties with other IDO compounds, and the picture is Not Good. Bristol-Myers Squibb has &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bms.com/press-release/bristolmyers/encouraging-response-observed-opdivo-nivolumab-plus-investigational-ido1-&quot;&gt;a big trial going&lt;/a&gt; with their own Opdivo (nivolumab) and their own IDO1 inhibitor (BMS-986205) in melanoma, and this bodes very ill for those results indeed. It has to be noted that they’ve announced what appear to be positive results for that combination&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bms.com/press-release/bristolmyers/encouraging-response-observed-opdivo-nivolumab-plus-investigational-ido1-&quot;&gt; in other trials&lt;/a&gt;, but hey: Merck and Incyte had what appeared to be decent-looking results early on, too. The feeling when this trial was announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biospace.com/article/confident-bristol-myers-to-launch-a-700-patient-phase-iii-ido-trial-for-melanoma/&quot;&gt;was that&lt;/a&gt; since the company was not waiting for the Merck readout that they must have been pretty confident. But that could also reflect the company’s feeling – not unjustified at all – that they’re locked in a brutal struggle with Merck in this area and had no time to sit around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only bad news for melanoma patients, for Merck, and (especially) for Incyte. And it’s not only potentially bad news for BMS. It’s potentially bad news for everyone who thought that their understanding of these pathways was good enough to predict success for this trial. One of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/next-generation-cancer-drugs-boost-immunotherapy-responses-1.22092&quot;&gt;biggest things going&lt;/a&gt; in immuno-oncology is the combination of the existing agents (PD pathway drugs) with other mechanisms to potentiate their effects and move them into new areas. This trial shows that we don’t know as much about how to do that as we thought we did. So although the IDO-based trials are now very uncertain, this news throws uncertainty around the entire field, whether it goes through that mechanism or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all eyes are on Bristol-Myers Squibb: will their current trial run to completion? I don’t know when they have any interim data reads coming up, but that’s going to be fraught with interest. The expectation at this point is that the trial will fail, for the same reasons – whatever those are – that the Merck/Incyte one just did. But there’s an outside chance that our ignorance of the field is even more profound and that it’ll actually work. &lt;em&gt;(Update: I should emphasize that the binding mode of the BMS compounds is in fact different from the earlier ones – will this make a difference?)&lt;/em&gt; Wouldn’t that be a twist? But you’d have to be brave to bet that way. . .we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>IDO Inhibitors Hit a Wall</title><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><description>Friday brought some very unwelcome news in oncology.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Heightened sexual risk in adolescence and young adulthood may be partially explained by deficits in executive functioning, the set of cognitive processes used to make reasoned decisions. However, the association between executive function and sexual risk is understudied among adolescent girls and young women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort of 853 young women age 18–25 in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, we evaluated executive function with three non-verbal cognitive tests: I. a rule-finding test, II. a trail-making test, and III. a figure drawing test.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Heightened sexual risk in adolescence and young adulthood may be partially explained by deficits in executive functioning, the set of cognitive processes used to make reasoned decisions. However, the association between executive function and sexual risk is understudied among adolescent girls and young women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort of 853 young women age 18–25 in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, we evaluated executive function with three non-verbal cognitive tests: I. a rule-finding test, II. a trail-making test, and III. a figure drawing test. Using log-binomial regression models, we estimated the association between lower executive function test scores and indicators of sexual risk (unprotected sex acts, concurrent partnerships, transactional sex, and recent HSV-2 infection).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In general, young women with lower executive function scores reported higher frequencies of sexual risk outcomes, though associations tended to be small with wide confidence intervals. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test I was associated with more unprotected sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.4 (1.0, 1.8)].

Sea turtles are distributed in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide. They play several ecological roles and are considered important indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Studying epibiotic diatoms living on turtle shells suggestively has great potential in the study of turtle behavior because diatoms are always there. However, diatom identification at the species level is time consuming, requires well-trained specialists, and there is a high probability of finding new taxa growing on turtle shells, which makes identification tricky. An alternative approach based on DNA barcoding and high throughput sequencing (HTS), metabarcoding, has been developed in recent years to identify species at the community level by using a DNA reference library. The suitabilities of morphological and molecular approaches were compared. Diatom assemblages were sampled from seven juvenile green turtles (&lt;i&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/i&gt;) from Mayotte Island, France. The structures of the epibiotic diatom assemblages differed between both approaches. This resulted in different clustering of the turtles based on their diatom communities. Metabarcoding allowed better discrimination between turtles based on their epibiotic diatom assemblages and put into evidence the presence of a cryptic diatom diversity. Microscopy, for its part, provided more ecological information of sea turtles based on historical bibliographical data and the abundances of ecological guilds of the diatom species present in the samples. This study shows the complementary nature of these two methods for studying turtle behavior.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>DNA metabarcoding and microscopic analyses of sea turtles biofilms: Complementary to understand turtle behavior</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195770</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195770</originId><fingerprint>5f2ddbf7</fingerprint><author><name>Sinziana F.

This study explores the association between specific insomnia symptoms (sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakenings symptoms) and self-efficacy (perceived self-confidence in the ability to use CPAP) with CPAP compliance in French patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of CPAP compliance in a cohort of 404 patients diagnosed with OSAS. Patients completed mailed questionnaires on sleepiness (ESS), insomnia (ISI) and self-efficacy in sleep apnea (SEMSA). Linear regression modeling analyses were performed to explore the impact of measured variables on the number of hours of CPAP use. Of the initial pool of 404 patients, 288 returned the questionnaires (71% response rate). Their mean age was 63.16±12.73 yrs, 31% were females, mean BMI was 30.39±6.31 kg/m2, mean daily CPAP use was 6.19±2.03 h, mean number of years of use was 6.58±6.03 yrs, and mean initial AHI before CPAP use was 34.61±20.71 /h. Age (p&amp;lt;0.01), BMI (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep onset insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep maintenance insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01) and self-efficacy (p&amp;lt;0.01) were significantly associated with mean daily CPAP use. We found that specific insomnia symptoms and self-efficacy were associated with CPAP compliance. Our findings underline the need to demonstrate that interventions that reduce insomnia symptoms and improve self-efficacy will increase CPAP compliance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Specific insomnia symptoms and self-efficacy explain CPAP compliance in a sample of OSAS patients</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195343</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195343</originId><fingerprint>6805e459</fingerprint><author><name>Pierre Philip</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195343</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522875600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575fb:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pierre Philip, Stéphanie Bioulac, Elemarije Altena, Charles M.

Our findings underline the need to demonstrate that interventions that reduce insomnia symptoms and improve self-efficacy will increase CPAP compliance.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195343</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled></item><item><content><content>Investigating microbial interactions from an ecological perspective is a particularly fruitful approach to unveil both new chemistry and bioactivity.

Background &lt;p&gt;Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20–62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012. Soldiers were clustered into different military occupational specialties: Infantry, Administration, Logistics, Logistics/Camp, Medical and Other. Data were collected through the use of the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol at the end of the international mission.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven percent reported MSCI during deployment, with 28% at the end.The most common locations of MSCI during the mission were lower back, knee, shoulders, upper back, neck and foot, while the knee and lower back prevailed at the end of the mission. Almost half of the soldiers who had MSCI reported affected work ability. The most common duties during the mission were vehicle patrolling, staff duties, guard/security duties, foot patrols and transportation. Soldiers reported that vehicle patrolling, staff duties and transportation were demanding with respect to endurance strength, guard/security duties challenged both maximum and endurance strength while foot patrolling challenged maximum and endurance strength, aerobic and anaerobic endurance and speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MSCI during international deployment are common among Swedish soldiers. The results indicate the need to further develop strategies focusing on matching the soldiers’ capacity to the job requirements, with relevant and fair physical selection-tests during the recruitment process and proactive interventions targeting MSCI before and during deployment, in order to enhance soldiers’ readiness and promote operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Self-reported musculoskeletal complaints and injuries and exposure of physical workload in Swedish soldiers serving in Afghanistan</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195548</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195548</originId><fingerprint>2ae4a2de</fingerprint><author><name>Alexandra Halvarsson</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195548</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73f:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandra Halvarsson, Ingela Hagman, Matthias Tegern, Lisbet Broman, Helena Larsson&lt;/p&gt;

A constellation of metabolic disorders, including obesity, dysregulated lipids, and elevations in blood glucose levels, has been associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Analysis of data from recently published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrated that reduced-function polymorphisms in the organic cation transporter, OCT1 (&lt;i&gt;SLC22A1&lt;/i&gt;), are significantly associated with higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) levels and an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, yet the mechanism linking OCT1 to these metabolic traits remains puzzling. Here, we show that OCT1, widely characterized as a drug transporter, plays a key role in modulating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, potentially by mediating thiamine (vitamin B1) uptake and hence its levels in the liver. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Oct1&lt;/i&gt; in mice resulted in reduced activity of thiamine-dependent enzymes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which disrupted the hepatic glucose–fatty acid cycle and shifted the source of energy production from glucose to fatty acids, leading to a reduction in glucose utilization, increased gluconeogenesis, and altered lipid metabolism. In turn, these effects resulted in increased total body adiposity and systemic levels of glucose and lipids. Importantly, wild-type mice on thiamine deficient diets (TDs) exhibited impaired glucose metabolism that phenocopied &lt;i&gt;Oct1&lt;/i&gt; deficient mice. Collectively, our study reveals a critical role of hepatic thiamine deficiency through &lt;i&gt;OCT1&lt;/i&gt; deficiency in promoting the metabolic inflexibility that leads to the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disease.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IHnbctiYrjc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) modulates multiple cardiometabolic traits through effects on hepatic thiamine content</title><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002907</link><recrawled>1523984586174</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002907</originId><engagementRate>0.13</engagementRate><fingerprint>ae0f0403</fingerprint><author><name>Xiaomin Liang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/IHnbctiYrjc/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523912400000</published><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162cf9286df:ce44a:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaomin Liang, Sook Wah Yee, Huan-Chieh Chien, Eugene C.

Background &lt;p&gt;A large number of programs have been implemented in many countries to increase the healthcare workforce recruitment in rural and remote areas. Rural early exposure programs for medical students have been shown to be effective strategies. However, no related studies have been reported before in China. This study was carried out to determine the association between medical students’ participation in rural clinical clerkships and their intentions to choose rural medical work after graduation from western medical schools in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on a two-stage random sampling method, the cross-sectional survey was carried out in ten western provinces in China. A brief questionnaire filled in by medical students was used for data collection. A total of 4278 medical students participated in the study. The response rate was approximately 90.34%. Pearson’s chi-squared tests and binary logistic regression analyses were performed for data analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Approximately 52.0% of medical students disclosed intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation. Only one in five participants had experience with a rural clinical clerkship. Rural clinical clerkships were significantly associated with medical students’ intentions to work in rural medical institutions (OR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.05–1.46); further analyses indicated that such clerkships only had a significant impact among the medical students with an urban background (OR: 2.10, 95%CI: 1.48–2.97). In terms of the sociodemographic characteristics, younger age, low level of parental education, majoring in general practice, and studying in low-level medical schools increased the odds of having intentions to engage in rural medical work among medical students; however, rural origins was the only positive univariate predictor. In addition, the predictors of intentions to choose rural medical work were different between medical students with a rural background and those with an urban background.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural clinical clerkship is likely to increase the odds of having intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation among medical students in western China, especially for those with an urban background. Related policy makers could consider developing compulsory rural clerkship programs and implement them among medical students to increase early rural exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Association between rural clinical clerkship and medical students’ intentions to choose rural medical work after graduation: A cross-sectional study in western China</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195266</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195266</originId><fingerprint>f150cd78</fingerprint><author><name>Jinlin Liu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195266</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522702800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76933:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinlin Liu, Bin Zhu, Ying Mao&lt;/p&gt;
