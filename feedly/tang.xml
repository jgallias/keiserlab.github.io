Despite increasing ability to store and analyze large amounts of data for organismal and ecological studies, the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images has largely remained time consuming and error-prone, particularly for tasks for which automation is difficult or impossible. Improving the efficiency of these tasks, which allows for more high quality data to be collected in a shorter amount of time, is therefore a high priority. The open-source web application, webpic, implements common web languages and widely available libraries and productivity apps to streamline the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images. In this paper, I introduce the framework of webpic and demonstrate one readily available feature of this application, linear measurements, using fossil leaf specimens. This application fills the gap between workflows accomplishable by individuals through existing software and those accomplishable by large, unmoderated crowds. It demonstrates that flexible web languages can be used to streamline time-intensive research tasks without the use of specialized equipment or proprietary software and highlights the potential for web resources to facilitate data collection in research tasks and outreach activities with improved efficiency.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4d326f63</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucy M.

Births outside marriage (BoM) account for around 15% of all births globally. However, the distribution around the world is very uneven, as are cultural and political attitudes towards them. Studies from East Asia have shown that the percentage of such births is very low, with only modest increases in recent years. The orthodox demographic view holds that the maintenance of conservative views around the relationship between marriage and childbearing can play a role in keeping fertility low. Prenuptial pregnancies (PNP) (where births occur within eight months of marriage) have been identified as a growing phenomenon in Japan, possibly being an ‘alternative’ Asian pathway to family formation.

Births outside marriage (BoM) account for around 15% of all births globally. However, the distribution around the world is very uneven, as are cultural and political attitudes towards them. Studies from East Asia have shown that the percentage of such births is very low, with only modest increases in recent years. The orthodox demographic view holds that the maintenance of conservative views around the relationship between marriage and childbearing can play a role in keeping fertility low. Prenuptial pregnancies (PNP) (where births occur within eight months of marriage) have been identified as a growing phenomenon in Japan, possibly being an ‘alternative’ Asian pathway to family formation. As yet, no comprehensive statistical analysis of the trends of BoM or PNP has been performed for Hong Kong. Using a comprehensive microdata set of birth registration in Hong Kong from 1984–2015 (N = 1,680,831) we provide evidence of recent trends in such ‘alternative pathways’ to family formation and examine predictors through regression analysis.

&lt;i&gt;Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARα)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Egl nine homolog 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;EGLN3)&lt;/i&gt; play critical roles in facilitating the adaptation to a hypoxic environment. However, the relationship between &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; variants and hypoxic adaptation remains poorly understood in Tibetan chickens. To better understand the effects of genetic variation, we sequenced exons of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; in 138 Lowland chickens (LC) from 7 breeds that were located in Emei, Miyi, Shimian, Wanyuan, Pengxian, and Muchuan in the Sichuan province, and Wenchang in the Hainan province (altitudes for these locations are below 1800 meters). Total 166 Tibetan chickens (TC) from 7 subpopulations that were located in Shigatse, Lhoka, Lhasa, Garze, Aba, Diqing and Yushu in the Tibetan area were also sequenced (altitudes greater than 2700 meters). One single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs316017491, C &gt; T) was identified in &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and was shared by TC and LC with no significant difference for allele frequencies between them (P &gt; 0.05). Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP1, A29410G; SNP2, rs13886097; SNP3, T29467C; SNP4, rs735915170; SNP5, rs736599044; and SNP6, rs740077421) including one non-synonymous mutation (SNP2, T &gt; C) were identified in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. This is the first report of SNP1 and SNP3. There was a difference between TC and LC for allele frequencies (P &amp;lt;0.01), except for SNP1, SNP4, and SNP5) The fix index statistic test indicated that there was population differentiation between TC and LC for SNP2, SNP3, and SNP6 in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic distance among chickens, finch and great tit were close for both &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. Bioinformatics analysis of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; showed that SNP2 leads to an amino acid substitution of Ile for Met, which results in the protein being more likely to be hydrolyzed.

&lt;i&gt;Salvia verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; (wild sage) is a commonly cultivated herbal medicine plant, which is native to the Mediterranean climate regions of Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. However, it has become an invasive species in semi-arid and arid regions of southern Australia. Two varieties are present in this region, var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; and var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt;, each of which can be distinguished by differences in morphology and flowering period. Following trials to determine the optimum temperate regime for germination and response to light and dark, seeds of both varieties were tested for their response to variations in pH, moisture stress, salinity, and burial depth. The temperature and light trial was carried out using three different temperature regimes; 30/20°C, 25/15°C and 20/12°C, and two light regimes; 12 hours light/12 hours dark and 24 hours dark, with var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; responding to relatively higher temperatures than var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. The germination rate of neither species was significantly inhibited by complete darkness when compared to rates under periodic light exposure. Both varieties germinated at near optimum rates strongly to very strongly in all pH buffer solutions, from pH 5 to pH 10, but they responded most strongly at neutral pH. Var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; showed slightly more tolerance to reduced moisture availability, moderate to strong salinity, and burial depth, compared to var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. However, even a fairly shallow burial depth of 2 cm completely inhibited germination of both varieties. Thus, in circumstances where both varieties are present in a soil seedbank, var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; could be expected to establish in more challenging conditions, where moisture is limited and salinity is ‘moderate to high’, implying that it is a more serious threat for invasive weed in conditions where crop plants are already challenged.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>38320c7d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Mansoor Javaid, Singarayer Florentine, Hafiz Haider Ali, Sandra Weller&lt;/p&gt;

Strategic purchasing is an essential health financing function. This paper compares the strategic purchasing practices of Thailand’s two tax-financed health insurance schemes, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), and identifies factors contributing to successful universal health coverage outcomes by analysing the relationships between the purchaser and government, providers and members. The study uses a cross-sectional mixed-methods design, including document review and interviews with 56 key informants. The Comptroller General Department (CGD) of Ministry of Finance manages CSMBS as one among civil servant welfare programmes. Their purchasing is passive. Fee for service payment for outpatient care has resulted in rapid cost escalation and overspending of their annual budget. In contrast, National Health Security Office (NHSO) manages purchasing for UCS, which undertakes a range of strategic purchasing actions, including applying closed ended provider payment, promoting primary healthcare’s gate keeping functions, exercising collective purchasing power and engaging views of members in decision making process. This difference in purchasing arrangements resulted in expenditure per CSMBS member being 4 times higher than UCS in 2014. The governance of the purchaser organization, the design of the purchasing arrangements including incentives and use of information, and the institutional capacities to implement purchasing functions are essential for effective strategic purchasing which can improve health system efficiency as a whole.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9ee1557c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Walaiporn Patcharanarumol, Warisa Panichkriangkrai, Angkana Sommanuttaweechai, Kara Hanson, Yaowaluk Wanwong, Viroj Tangcharoensathien&lt;/p&gt;

Koshu is indigenous to Japan and considered the most important wine grape in Japan. Koshu grape berry possesses characteristics that make it unique from European &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vinifera&lt;/i&gt; as wine grape. However, the physiological characteristics of Koshu leaf and internode remain unknown. An understanding of those characteristics would contribute to improvements in Koshu cultivation, thereby enhancing grape berry and wine quality. To identify the genes responsible for the physiological characteristics of Koshu, we comprehensively analyzed leaf and internode differences at the transcriptome level between Koshu and Pinot Noir by RNA sequencing. A total of 248 and 131 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in leaves and internodes, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of these DEGs revealed that “flavonoid biosynthesis” and “glutathione metabolism” pathways were significantly enriched in Koshu leaves. On the other hand, when internodes were compared, “flavonoid”-related GO terms were specifically detected in Koshu. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the expression of such genes as &lt;i&gt;leucoanthocyanidin reductase&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;flavonol synthase&lt;/i&gt; in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was higher in Koshu than Pinot Noir. Measurement of the relative expression levels of these genes by RT-qPCR validated the results obtained by RNA sequencing. The characteristics of Koshu leaf and internode, which are expected to produce flavonoids with antibacterial activity and UV protection function, would suit Japanese climate as a survival strategy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>94c9372c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shinichi Enoki, Yu Hamaguchi, Shunji Suzuki, Hiroyuki Fujisawa, Tomoki Hattori, Kayo Arita, Chiho Yamaguchi, Masachika Mikami, Shu Nagasaka, Keisuke Tanaka&lt;/p&gt;

In applications of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in clinical psychiatry settings in Japan, a phonemic verbal fluency test (VFT) that includes “switching” (the ability to shift efficiently to a new word subcategory) to assess phonemic fluency is employed to capture disease-specific hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, to extend the specific features of this test, the VFT was repeated to examine an activation change in NIRS measurements in 20 healthy males. Without task performance change, the hemodynamic activation induced by the VFT was significantly attenuated in the left PFC through repetition of the task. These findings suggest that the left PFC is involved in processing of the VFT. Further, it may be possible to extend the current VFT using this repetition to provide a more sensitive examination of the left PFC, whose dysfunction has been reported in several psychiatric diseases such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e56ec173</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshihiro Kawakubo, Masaya Yanagi, Noa Tsujii, Osamu Shirakawa&lt;/p&gt;

The natural alkaloid berberine has been ascribed numerous health benefits including lipid and cholesterol reduction and improved insulin sensitivity in diabetics. However, oral (PO) administration of berberine is hindered by poor bioavailability and increasing dose often elicits gastro-intestinal side effects. To overcome the caveats associated with oral berberine, we developed transdermal (TD) formulations of berberine (BBR) and the berberine precursor dihydroberberine (DHB). These formulations were compared to oral BBR using pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and general safety studies &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To complete this work, a sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated according the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods to simultaneously measure berberine, simvastatin, and simvastatin hydroxy acid with relative quantification used for the berberine metabolite demethylene berberine glucuronide (DBG). Acute pharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated a statistically relevant ranking for berberine bioavailability based upon AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-8&lt;/sub&gt; as DHB TD &gt; BBR TD &gt;&gt; BBR PO with similar ranking for the metabolite DBG, indicating that transdermal administration achieves BBR levels well above oral administration. Similarly, chronic administration (14 days) resulted in significantly higher levels of circulating BBR and DBG in DHB TD treated animals. Chronically treated rats were given a single dose of simvastatin with no observed change in the drugs bioavailability compared with control, suggesting the increased presence of BBR had no effect on simvastatin metabolism. This observation was further supported by consistent CYP3A4 expression across all treatment groups. Moreover, no changes in kidney and liver biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, were observed between treatment formats, and confirming previous reports that BBR has no effect on HMG-CoA expression. This study supports the safe use of transdermal compositions that improve on the poor bioavailability of oral berberine and have the potential to be more efficacious in the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2548997e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beth Buchanan, Qingfang Meng, Mathieu-Marc Poulin, Jonathan Zuccolo, Chike Godwin Azike, Joseph Gabriele, David Charles Baranowski&lt;/p&gt;

To determine its mechanism of action, we solved an atomic-resolution structure of ISRIB bound in a deep cleft within decameric human eIF2B by cryo–electron microscopy. Formation of fully active, decameric eIF2B holoenzyme depended on the assembly of two identical tetrameric subcomplexes, and ISRIB promoted this step by cross-bridging a central symmetry interface.

Formation of fully active, decameric eIF2B holoenzyme depended on the assembly of two identical tetrameric subcomplexes, and ISRIB promoted this step by cross-bridging a central symmetry interface. Thus, regulation of eIF2B assembly emerges as a rheostat for eIF2B activity that tunes translation during the ISR and that can be further modulated by ISRIB.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/eaaq0939?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>11</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/eaaq0939?rss=1</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Structure of the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B reveals mechanism of memory-enhancing molecule</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522345097000</published><author><name>Tsai, J.

Using in-field bioreactors, we investigated the influence of exogenous microorganisms in groundwater planktonic and biofilm microbial communities as part of the Integrated Field Research Challenge (IFRC). After an acclimation period with source groundwater, bioreactors received either filtered (0.22 μM filter) or unfiltered well groundwater in triplicate and communities were tracked routinely for 23 days after filtration was initiated. To address geochemical influences, the planktonic phase was assayed periodically for protein, organic acids, physico-/geochemical measurements and bacterial community (via 16S rRNA gene sequencing), while biofilms (i.e. microbial growth on sediment coupons) were targeted for bacterial community composition at the completion of the experiment (23 d). Based on Bray-Curtis distance, planktonic bacterial community composition varied temporally and between treatments (filtered, unfiltered bioreactors). Notably, filtration led to an increase in the dominant genus, &lt;i&gt;Zoogloea&lt;/i&gt; relative abundance over time within the planktonic community, while remaining relatively constant when unfiltered. At day 23, biofilm communities were more taxonomically and phylogenetically diverse and substantially different from planktonic bacterial communities; however, the biofilm bacterial communities were similar regardless of filtration. These results suggest that although planktonic communities were sensitive to groundwater filtration, bacterial biofilm communities were stable and resistant to filtration. Bioreactors are useful tools in addressing questions pertaining to microbial community assembly and succession. These data provide a first step in understanding how an extrinsic factor, such as a groundwater inoculation and flux of microbial colonizers, impact how microbial communities assemble in environmental systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>96380ad6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Geoff A.

These data provide a first step in understanding how an extrinsic factor, such as a groundwater inoculation and flux of microbial colonizers, impact how microbial communities assemble in environmental systems.</description><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194663</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194663</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Use of in-field bioreactors demonstrate groundwater filtration influences planktonic bacterial community assembly, but not biofilm composition</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><published>1521579600000</published><author><name>Geoff A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a significant global public health problem and recognized as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to assess the current prevalence of hypertension and to explore risk factors associated with hypertension by urban and rural status to guide the prevention and control of hypertension in Jilin province.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A multi-stage stratified random cluster sampling method was used to obtain data on hypertension, which was investigated by physical examination and face-to-face questionnaire in July 2014-December 2015. Sample data were analyzed by complex weighted statistical analysis to estimate blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension in the province. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing hypertension rates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in rural areas than urban areas (25.93% versus 22.73%, respectively). The rates of hypertension known (46.7% versus 38.1%, respectively), control (13.7% versus 5.0%, respectively), and controlled among treated subjects (38.3% versus 17.5%, respectively) were higher in urban areas than in rural areas (all p &amp;lt; 0.001), while the treatment rate was not statistically significantly different between urban and rural areas (35.9% versus 28.4%, respectively). After adjusting for demographic covariates, hypertension prevalence in rural areas was still significantly greater than in urban areas (adjusted OR = 1.22; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.36; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Common risk factors for hypertension among urban and rural residents included older age; male; married; employed; less education; overweight/obese; greater abdominal waist circumference; family history of hypertension, stroke, or coronary heart disease; current smoker; alcohol consumption; higher visceral adiposity index; and higher body fat percentage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study identified an increased risk for hypertension in rural regions of Jilin province, suggesting that rural hypertension screening and treatment guidelines should receive greater attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>54c604a4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junnan Wang, Wei Sun, George A.

Discovery of copy number variations (CNVs), a major category of structural variations, have dramatically changed our understanding of differences between individuals and provide an alternate paradigm for the genetic basis of human diseases. CNVs include both copy gain and copy loss events and their detection genome-wide is now possible using high-throughput, low-cost next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. However, accurate detection of CNVs from NGS data is not straightforward due to non-uniform coverage of reads resulting from various systemic biases. We have developed an integrated platform, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV, to handle some of these issues in CNV detection in whole genome NGS data. It has a modular framework comprising five major modules: data pre-treatment, segmentation, variant calling, annotation and visualization. An important feature of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is the functional annotation module that enables the user to identify and prioritize CNVs encompassing various functional elements, genomic features and disease-associations. Parallelization of the segmentation algorithms makes the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV platform even accessible on a desktop. Here we show the effect of sequencing coverage, read length, bin size, data pre-treatment and segmentation approaches on accurate detection of the complete spectrum of CNVs. Performance of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is evaluated on both simulated data and real data for different sequencing depths. It is an open-source integrated pipeline available at https://github.com/vogetihrsh/icopydav and as Docker’s image at http://bioinf.iiit.ac.in/icopydav/.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b0ae3867</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Prashanthi Dharanipragada, Sriharsha Vogeti, Nita Parekh&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to explore the trend in population levels, as well as the correlates, of occupational and leisure sitting time in full-time employed Australian adults between 2007 and 2015. We used data from the 2007/08, 2011/12 and 2014/15 Australian Health Surveys, in which nationally representative samples of the Australian population were interviewed. Full-time (≥35 hours/week) employed respondents reported sitting time at work and during leisure on a usual workday. Trends over time and associations between socio-demographic and health-related characteristics and sitting time were analysed in the combined dataset using multivariable logistic regression models. Over 21,000 observations were included in the analyses. Across the three surveys, approximately 51% of the respondents reported ≥4 hours/workday occupational sitting time, 40% reported ≥4 hours/workday leisure sitting time, and 55% reported ≥7 hours/workday combined occupational and leisure sitting time. There were no clear trends over time. All potential correlates were associated with occupational sitting time and all but educational level were associated with leisure sitting time. The directions of the associations with gender, age and leisure-time physical activity were reversed for occupational sitting time and leisure sitting time. These findings show that the average levels of occupational and leisure sitting time on workdays were high but stable over the past decade. The observed differences in correlates of occupational and leisure sitting time demonstrate the need to assess and address sedentary behaviour domains separately in research and policy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c248095f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne Loyen, Tien Chey, Lina Engelen, Adrian Bauman, Jeroen Lakerveld, Hidde P. van der Ploeg, Johannes Brug, Josephine Y.

There is a marked comorbidity between alcohol abuse and eating disorders, especially in the young population. We have previously reported that bingeing on fat during adolescence increases the rewarding effects of ethanol (EtOH). The aim of the present work was to study if vulnerability to EtOH persists after cessation of binge eating. OF1 mice binged on fat (HFB: high-fat binge) during adolescence (PND 25–43) and were tested for 15 days after the last access to HFB (on PND 59) using the self-administration paradigm, the conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization to ethanol. Our results showed that after 15 days of cessation of fat ingestion, mice increased their consumption of ethanol and showed greater motivation to obtain ethanol. On the other hand, no effects were observed in the CPP, while an increased locomotor response to ethanol was detected. The present results confirm and extend our previous study demonstrating that the compulsive intake of fat induces long-lasting effects on the reward system that lead to an increased consumption of EtOH.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9984bae5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing architectures with many interconnections of simple neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets, Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

Transfer entropy from non-uniform embedding is a popular tool for the inference of causal relationships among dynamical subsystems. In this study we present an approach that makes use of low-dimensional conditional mutual information quantities to decompose the original high-dimensional conditional mutual information in the searching procedure of non-uniform embedding for significant variables at different lags.

Transfer entropy from non-uniform embedding is a popular tool for the inference of causal relationships among dynamical subsystems. In this study we present an approach that makes use of low-dimensional conditional mutual information quantities to decompose the original high-dimensional conditional mutual information in the searching procedure of non-uniform embedding for significant variables at different lags. We perform a series of simulation experiments to assess the sensitivity and specificity of our proposed method to demonstrate its advantage compared to previous algorithms. The results provide concrete evidence that low-dimensional approximations can help to improve the statistical accuracy of transfer entropy in multivariate causality analysis and yield a better performance over other methods. The proposed method is especially efficient as the data length grows.</description><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194382</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194382</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Low-dimensional approximation searching strategy for transfer entropy from non-uniform embedding</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><published>1521234000000</published><author><name>Jian Zhang</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194382</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194382</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849e6:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alberto Fernández-Villar, Cristina Represas-Represas, Cecilia Mouronte-Roibás, Cristina Ramos-Hernández, Ana Priegue-Carrera, Sara Fernández-García, José Luis López-Campos&lt;/p&gt;
Objectives &lt;p&gt;Although not currently recommended, spirometry during hospitalization due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an opportunity to enhance the diagnosis of this disease. The aim of the present study was to assess the usefulness and reliability of spirometry before hospital discharge, comparing it to measurements obtained during clinical stability.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective longitudinal observational study compares spirometry results before and 8 weeks after discharge in consecutive patients admitted for COPD exacerbation. Concordance between results was assessed by the Kappa index, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman graphs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From an initial population of 179 COPD patients, 100 completed the study (mean age 67.8 years, 83% men, 35% active smokers, FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at clinical stability 40.3%). Forty-nine patients could not complete the study because they did not reach clinical stability. In three patients with obstructive spirometry during admission, the results were normal at follow-up. In the remaining patients, the COPD diagnosis was confirmed at stability with acceptable concordance. In 27 cases, spirometry improved more than 200 mL.No variables were found to be associated with this improvement or to explain it.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study provides information on the role of spirometry prior to hospital discharge in patients admitted for COPD exacerbation, demonstrating that it is a valid and reproducible method, representing an opportunity toimprove COPD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c9f43a4b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alberto Fernández-Villar, Cristina Represas-Represas, Cecilia Mouronte-Roibás, Cristina Ramos-Hernández, Ana Priegue-Carrera, Sara Fernández-García, José Luis López-Campos&lt;/p&gt;

Availability and implementation: SAFE-clustering, including source codes and tutorial, is free available on the web at http://yunliweb.its.unc.edu/safe/.</description><crawled>1522262381669</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215723v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215723v2?rss=1</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>SAFE-clustering: Single-cell Aggregated (From Ensemble) Clustering for Single-cell RNA-seq Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522220400000</published><author><name>Yang, Y.</name></author><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/28/215723</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215723v2?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626de89465:6b272f1:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education–research gap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education–research gap, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Engaging undergraduates in computational tasks can improve genomic research laboratory productivity, benefiting both students and senior laboratory members.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>46d1775b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education–research gap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education–research gap, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Engaging undergraduates in computational tasks can improve genomic research laboratory productivity, benefiting both students and senior laboratory members.</description><crawled>1522944970711</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113</href></item></alternate><engagement>13</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Involving undergraduates in genomics research to narrow the education–research gap</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522911600000</published><author><name>Serghei Mangul</name></author><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4113</originId><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nbt.4113-F1.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>345</height><width>685</width></visual><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_16296980fd7:a466566:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Cancer immunotherapy can confer durable benefit, but the percentage of patients who respond to this approach remains modest. The ability to concentrate immunostimulatory compounds at the site of disease can overcome local immune tolerance and reduce systemic toxicity. Surgical resection of tumors may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy by removing the concentrated immunosuppressive microenvironment; however, it also removes tumor-specific leukocytes as well as tumor antigens that may be important to establishing antitumor immunity.

All you have to do to appreciate the horrors of this field is to step into a lab that does it for a living: stacks and stacks and stacks of plates, each with a slightly different set of conditions (buffers, concentrations, additives, protein construct, and son on) to try, once again, to get a protein crystal that diffracts well enough for structure determination. It’s especially tricky to get the ones with your small molecule sitting inside them at its binding site, but when you do, the payoffs can be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing such things at the quality levels needed, though, is an absolute black art. There are trends (sometimes), better ideas about starting points (sometimes), rational modifications of the protein sequence to increase your chances (sometimes), but in the end, it still comes down to relentless empirical try-it-and-see. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25971&quot;&gt;latest paper&lt;/a&gt; (writeup by &lt;em&gt;C&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i15/Cryo-electron-microscopy-reveals-protein.html?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=CEN&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is looking at a well-known protein crystal (glucose isomerase) that is also well known to exist it two polymorphic forms (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/28/down-at-the-crystal-surface&quot;&gt;that last post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject for more on polymorphs). What isn’t well known is why it forms these particular two types of crystals and how that happens. In virtually every case of polymorphism, we have little or no clue about such things, and I’m very glad to see clues starting to be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these authors have done is to start the crystallization process in ammonium sulfate solution and then freeze the solutions (liquid nitrogen) at various time points, imaging the crystals thus found by electron microscopy. And there are some surprises. At the twenty-second time point, there are already “nanorod” crystals forming, which are, on the average, &lt;em&gt;two protein molecules wide and twelve molecules long&lt;/em&gt;. You are not going to get too much earlier in the crystal formation process than that. The concentration of the nanorods increases over time. However, their length does not: they seem stuck at this size. They do start to associate into fibrils as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other things happening as well. There are other species in there (trimer, tetramers, single-file chains), and after about thirty minutes you can also see faceted nanocrystals of the two known bulk polymorphs, one prismatic and rodlike and one rhombic. The smallest of each are in the 100 nM range along their shortest edges. Trying the experiment using PEG instead of ammonium sulfate (another known set of conditions for producing these protein crystals) shows that the useful concentration range for the additive is much narrower, but in both cases, at the low end of the range you get rhombic, and at the high end you get prismatic. With PEG, though, if you keep pushing it, you get no crystals at all, but rather an amorphous gel-like state. And in none of the PEG experiments did they ever observe the nanorods seen in ammonium sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Nature, C&amp;amp;E News&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg 264w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-300x341.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals.jpeg 700w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13431&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gelation pathway seemed to involve fibril formation as well, which looked in the earlier experiments like it might be a precursor to formation of the rhombic crystals. Weirdly, the authors found that you can take some of that gel and use it to nucleate another protein solution, one that would otherwise form only the rhombic crystals, and form the prismatic crystals with it instead (which is a bizarre thought to me, and probably to a lot of other people who don’t crystallize things for a living). You actually see the crystals growing out of the surface of the lump of gelatinous protein gorp, as shown at right. This is order out of chaos, for sure; I’ll bet that the temperature of the solution at that interface is changing just to make the thermodynamics of all that loss of entropy work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the early stages of crystal formation like this allowed the authors to come up with all the plausible models of the nanorods and compare those to experimental data. One clearly matches better than the rest of them, so now we know what the earliest crystal formation contacts are, and can start to explain why. The preferred mode of contact buries a lot more negative charges in the protein surface, and the paper goes into detail about how this can explain the effects of sulfate ions in the solution versus PEG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it appears that the prismatic crystals (from ammonium sulfate) are made up of bunches of nanorods, rather than growing molecule-by-molecule, which is also contrary to the mental pictures that many of us have. Meanwhile, the rhombic crystals grow more like the traditional picture, monomer by monomer. The nanorod form, though, can also be trapped in a metastable fibril state, starting off as individual fibrils and going on to a gel, with too high an activation energy to dissociate and form prismatic crystals. But its surface can nucleate the formation of such crystals (as in the above photo). At really high PEG concentrations you get a different gel, which is not composed of fibrils, and seems to be a complete dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they don’t see any evidence for, though, is another mode predicted by theory (and which I mentioned in the last post on this stuff): formation of phase-separated nanodroplets that then crystallize. Those nanodroplets take us back to the hot topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;protein condensates&lt;/a&gt; inside cells, and perhaps its a good thing that they’re not invariably precursors to forming protein crystals (!) That is very likely the reason that such condensates seem to feature intrinsically disordered proteins as well, to avoid the crystallization problem. . .&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, entrepreneurship has been gaining more prominence as a potential tool for solving poverty in developing countries. This paper mainly examines the relationship between farmer entrepreneurship and rural poverty alleviation in China by assessing the contribution of farm entrepreneurs towards overcoming poverty. Data were collected from 309 employees of farmer entrepreneurships in Guangxi Province through survey questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct an analysis of the effects of three identified capabilities of farm entrepreneurs—economic, educational and knowledge, and socio-cultural capabilities—on attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth and the qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship and how these in turn affect rural poverty, using AMOS 21. The findings show that socio-cultural capability has the greatest influence on farmer entrepreneurship growth (β = 0.50, p&amp;lt;0.001). The qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship also more significantly impacts rural poverty (β = 0.69, p&amp;lt;0.001) than attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth. This study suggests that policy makers in China should involve more rural farmers in the targeted poverty alleviation strategies of the government by equipping rural farmers with entrepreneurial skills. This can serve as a sustainable, bottom-up approach to alleviating rural poverty in remote areas of the country. The study also extends the literature on the farmer entrepreneurship-rural poverty alleviation nexus in China, and this can serve as a lesson for other developing countries in the fight against rural poverty.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fb35b522</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Yaw Naminse, Jincai Zhuang&lt;/p&gt;

report a one-step, Ru(II)-catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction that is
conceptually different from the previously reported protocols that include
Corey-Chaykovsky, Simmons-Smith, and metal catalyzed carbene attack on olefins.
Under the current protocol, various alcohols are transformed into sulfone
substituted cyclopropanes with excellent isolated yields and diastereoselectivities.
This new reaction forms highly congested cyclopropane products with three new
C–C bonds, three or two new chiral centers and one new quaternary carbon
center. 22 examples of isolated substrates are given. Previously reported
synthetic routes for similar substrates are all multi-step, linear routes that
proceed with overall low yields and poor control of stereochemistry.
Experimental mechanistic investigations suggest initial metal-catalyzed
dehydrogenation of the alcohol substrate and catalyst independent stepwise
attack of two equivalents of sulfone on the aldehyde under basic conditions.

report a one-step, Ru(II)-catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction that is
conceptually different from the previously reported protocols that include
Corey-Chaykovsky, Simmons-Smith, and metal catalyzed carbene attack on olefins.
Under the current protocol, various alcohols are transformed into sulfone
substituted cyclopropanes with excellent isolated yields and diastereoselectivities.
This new reaction forms highly congested cyclopropane products with three new
C–C bonds, three or two new chiral centers and one new quaternary carbon
center. 22 examples of isolated substrates are given. Previously reported
synthetic routes for similar substrates are all multi-step, linear routes that
proceed with overall low yields and poor control of stereochemistry.
Experimental mechanistic investigations suggest initial metal-catalyzed
dehydrogenation of the alcohol substrate and catalyst independent stepwise
attack of two equivalents of sulfone on the aldehyde under basic conditions.
While the Ru(II) is only responsible for the initial dehydrogenation step, the
rate of aldehyde formation is crucial to maintaining the right balance of
intermediates needed to afford the cyclopropane product.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16267b961cc:612c384:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nichole E.

Metagenomics is a powerful tool for characterizing viral composition within environmental samples, but sample and molecular processing steps can bias the estimation of viral community structure. The objective of this study is to understand the inherent variability introduced when conducting viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater and provide a bioinformatic strategy to accurately analyze sequences for viral community analyses. A standard approach using a combination of ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, and DNase treatment, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) produced DNA preparations without any bacterial derived genes. Results showed recoveries in wastewater matrix ranged between 60–100%. A bias towards small single stranded DNA (ssDNA; polyomavirus) virus types vs larger double stranded DNA (dsDNA; adenovirus) viruses was also observed with a total estimated recovery of small circular viruses to be as much as 173-fold higher. Notably, ssDNA abundance decreased with sample dilution while large dsDNA genomes (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Caudovirales&lt;/i&gt;) initially increased in abundance with dilution before gradually decreasing with further dilution in wastewater samples. The present study revealed the inherent biases associated with different components of viral metagenomic methods applied to wastewater. Overall, these results provide a well-characterized approach for effectively conducting viral metagenomics analysis of wastewater and reveal that dilution can effectively mitigate MDA bias.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>433d97fb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nichole E.

Background &lt;p&gt;The ageing population and the expected increase in the number of elderly patients make an evidence-based assessment of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in old patients progressively more important. Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged &amp;lt;65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P&amp;lt;0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score.

In the physiochemical sciences, plasma is used to describe an ionized gas. Previous studies have implicated plasma surface treatment in the enhancement of hydrophilicity of implanted musculoskeletal reconstructive materials. Hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramics, widely used in bone tissue regeneration, have made great advancements to skeletal surgery. In the present study, we investigate the impact of low-pressure plasma on the interconnected porous calcium hydroxyapatite (IP-CHA) both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our results indicate that dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, when used with oxygen, can augment the hydrophilicity of non-porous HA surfaces and the osteoconductivity of the IP-CHA disc via increased water penetration of inner porous structures, as demonstrated through microfocus computed tomography (μCT) assay. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; implantation of plasma-treated IP-CHA displayed superior bone ingrowth than untreated IP-CHA. Though plasma-treated IP-CHA did not alter osteoblast cell proliferation, it accelerated osteogenic differentiation of seeded marrow mesenchymal stem cells. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that this plasma treatment increases levels of oxygen, rather than nitrogen, on the plasma-treated IP-CHA surface. These findings suggest that plasma treatment, an easy and simple processing, can significantly improve the osteoconductive potential of commonly used artificial bones such as IP-CHA.

The fornicata (fornicates) is a eukaryotic group known to consist of free-living and parasitic organisms. Genome datasets of two model fornicate parasites &lt;i&gt;Giardia intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spironucleus salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are well annotated, so far. The nuclear genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; assemblages and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are small in terms of the genome size and simple in genome structure. However, an ancestral genomic structure and gene contents, from which genomes of the fornicate parasites have evolved, remains to be clarified. In order to understand genome evolution in fornicates, here, we present the draft genome sequence of a free-living fornicate, &lt;i&gt;Kipferlia bialata&lt;/i&gt;, the divergence of which is earlier than those of the fornicate parasites, and compare it to the genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;. Our data show that the number of protein genes and introns in &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome are the most abundant in the genomes of three fornicates, reflecting an ancestral state of fornicate genome evolution.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) are frequently exposed to computed tomography (CT). Each CT exposes patients to radiation that cumulatively could increase the risk of malignancy, particularly in younger patients. We aim to study the effect of age on CT use in IBD patients seen in the Emergency Department (ED) or the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study of IBD patients identified in Truven Health Marketscan databases between 2009–2013. The main outcome was use of CT during an ED or inpatient visit. Effect of age on CT use was characterized using logistic regression accounting for important covariables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 66,731 patients with IBD with 144,147 ED or inpatient visits in this cohort with a diagnosis code of IBD. At first visit, 5.8% percent were below age 18. CT was utilized in 26.6% of visits. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for medications, recent surgery, and gender, patients 18–35 were more likely to undergo CT (OR 2.35, 95%CI: 2.20–2.52) compared to those &amp;lt;18. Examining patients only between 16 and 19, the odds of an 18 or 19-year-old undergoing CT is significantly higher than a 16 or 17-year-old (OR 1.96, 95%CI: 1.71–2.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with IBD undergo CT more than a quarter of the time in the ED or inpatient setting. Pediatric providers limit radiation exposure among those &amp;lt;18 while adult providers are not as cautious with radiation exposure for the young adult population.

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2467dea2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

L1 encodes two essential proteins: L1ORF1p, a unique RNA-binding protein, and L1ORF2p, an endonuclease and reverse transcriptase. L1ORF1p contains an essential, but rapidly evolving N-terminal portion, homo-trimerizes via a coiled coil and packages L1RNA into large assemblies. Here, we determined crystal structures of the entire coiled coil domain of human L1ORF1p. We show that retrotransposition requires a non-ideal and metastable coiled coil structure, and a strongly basic L1ORF1p amino terminus.

L1 encodes two essential proteins: L1ORF1p, a unique RNA-binding protein, and L1ORF2p, an endonuclease and reverse transcriptase. L1ORF1p contains an essential, but rapidly evolving N-terminal portion, homo-trimerizes via a coiled coil and packages L1RNA into large assemblies. Here, we determined crystal structures of the entire coiled coil domain of human L1ORF1p. We show that retrotransposition requires a non-ideal and metastable coiled coil structure, and a strongly basic L1ORF1p amino terminus. Human L1ORF1p therefore emerges as a highly calibrated molecular machine, sensitive to mutation but functional in different hosts. Our analysis rationalizes the locally rapid L1ORF1p sequence evolution and reveals striking mechanistic parallels to coiled coil-containing membrane fusion proteins. It also suggests how trimeric L1ORF1p could form larger meshworks and indicates critical novel steps in L1 retrotransposition.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1624dd188f8:3e3a9da:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a39fb23f</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025334?af=R</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025334?af=R</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Communication: Density functional theory model for multi-reference systems based on the exact-exchange hole normalization</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522134666000</published><author><name>Henryk Laqua</name></author><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025334?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f890e:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>Idealized simulations of tropical moist convection have revealed that clouds can spontaneously clump together in a process called self-aggregation.

Recent advances in culture-free microbiological techniques bring new understanding of the role of intestinal microbiota in heath and performance. Intestinal microbial communities in chickens assume a near-stable state within the week which leaves a very small window for permanent microbiota remodelling. It is the first colonisers that determine the fate of microbial community in humans and birds alike, and after the microbiota has matured there are very small odds for permanent modification as stable community resists change. In this study we inoculated broiler chicks immediately post hatch, with 3 species of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA and pheS genes as &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;reuteri&lt;/i&gt;. The strains were isolated from the gut of healthy chickens as reproducibly persistent &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; strains among multiple flocks. Birds inoculated with the probiotic mix reached significantly higher weight by 28 days of age. Although each strain was able to colonise when administered alone, administering the probiotic mix at-hatch resulted in colonisation by only &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt;. High initial abundance of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt; was slowly reducing, however, the effects of at-hatch administration of the &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; mix on modifying microbiota development and structure remained persistent.

Background &lt;p&gt;Adult leg length is influenced by nutrition in the first few years of life. Adult head circumference is an indicator of brain growth. Cross-sectional studies indicate inverse associations with dementia risk, but there have been few prospective studies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, and anthropometric measures taken, with ascertainment of incident dementia, and mortality, three to five years later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the original at risk cohort of 13,587 persons aged 65 years and over, 2,443 (18.0%) were lost to follow-up; 10,540 persons with skull circumference assessments were followed up for 40,466 person years, and 10,400 with leg length assessments were followed up for 39,954 person years. There were 1,009 cases of incident dementia, and 1,605 dementia free deaths. The fixed effect pooled meta-analysed adjusted subhazard ratio (ASHR) for leg length (highest vs. lowest quarter) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.66–0.97) and for skull circumference was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.84–1.25), with no heterogeneity of effect between sites (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Leg length measurements tended to be shorter at follow-up, particularly for those with baseline cognitive impairment and dementia. However, leg length change was not associated with dementia incidence (ASHR, per cm 1.006, 95% CI 0.992–1.020), and the effect of leg length was little altered after adjusting for baseline frailty (ASHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–0.99). A priori hypotheses regarding effect modification by gender or educational level were not supported. However, the effect of skull circumference was modified by gender (M vs F ASHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.98), but in the opposite direction to that hypothesized with a greater protective effect of larger skull dimensions in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Consistent findings across settings provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life. Leg length is a relatively stable marker of early life nutritional programming, which may confer brain reserve and protect against neurodegeneration in later life through mitigation of cardiometabolic risk. Further clarification of these associations could inform predictive models for future dementia incidence in the context of secular trends in adult height, and invigorate global efforts to improve childhood nutrition, growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9d93eb2c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martin J.

Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population genetics processes—notably, by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8BI0l7B3nAc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuval B.

&lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of &lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

Background &lt;p&gt;Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a leading cause of premature mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Women of reproductive age are a unique and vulnerable group of RHD patients, due to increased risk of cardiovascular complications and death during pregnancy. Yet, less than 5% of women of childbearing age with RHD in LMICs use contraceptives, and one in five pregnant women with RHD take warfarin despite known teratogenicity. It is unclear whether this suboptimal contraception and anticoagulant use during pregnancy is due to lack of health system resources, limited health literacy, or social pressure to bear children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a mixed methods study of 75 women living with RHD in Uganda. Questionnaires were administered to 50 patients. Transcripts from three focus groups with 25 participants were analyzed using qualitative description methodology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Several themes emerged from the focus groups, including pregnancy as a calculated risk; misconceptions about side-effects of contraceptives and anticoagulation; reproductive decision-making control by male partners, in-laws, or physicians; abandonment of patients by male partners; and considerable stigma against heart disease patients for both their reproductive and financial limitations (often worse than that directed against HIV patients). All questionnaire respondents were told by physicians that their hearts were not strong enough to support a pregnancy. Only 14% used contraception while taking warfarin. All participants felt that society would look poorly on a woman who cannot have children due to a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study of female RHD patients and their attitudes toward cardiovascular disorders and reproduction. Our results suggest that health programs targeting heart disease in LMICs must pay special attention to the needs of women of childbearing age. There are opportunities for improved family/societal education programs and community engagement, leading to better outcomes and patient empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5f3aa237</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Y.

The results quantify the contribution made by each kind of information used.</description><crawled>1522685593223</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293159v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293159v1?rss=1</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>TranCEP: Predicting transmembrane transport proteins using composition, evolutionary, and positional information [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522652400000</published><author><name>Alballa, M.</name></author><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/02/293159</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293159v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16287224687:8bf56ce:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><fingerprint>5420a0ef</fingerprint><keywords><item>Asia/Pacific News, Paleontology</item></keywords><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/22?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>31</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/22?rss=1</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Edge of extinction</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522950073000</published><author><name>Kumar, S.</name></author><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/22.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/22?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a52985b:34f43e70</id></item><item><fingerprint>dba15cee</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00097/20180403/images/medium/bi-2018-00097p_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00097&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

We choose our top performing methods to select the union of the resulting variables based on a user-defined percentage of variants selected from each method to take to downstream analysis. Our simulation analysis shows that non-parametric data mining approaches, such as MDR, may work best under one simulation criteria for the high effect size (penetrance) datasets, while non-parametric methods designed for feature selection, such as Ranger and Gradient boosting, work best under other simulation criteria. Thus, using a collective approach proves to be more beneficial for selecting variables with epistatic effects also in low effect size datasets and different genetic architectures. Following this, we applied our proposed collective feature selection approach to select the top 1% of variables to identify potential interacting variables associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in ~44,000 samples obtained from Geisinger&apos;s MyCode Community Health Initiative (on behalf of DiscovEHR collaboration). Conclusions: In this study, we were able to show that selecting variables using a collective feature selection approach could help in selecting true positive epistatic variables more frequently than applying any single method for feature selection via simulation studies.

Urinary type IV collagen (U-Col4) and albumin excretion is evaluated to monitor the development of diabetic kidney disease. However, U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, 1067 participants without diabetes and with urinary albumin-creatinine ratio &amp;lt;300 mg/gCr (normo- or microalbuminuria) who underwent an annual health examination in 2004 were enrolled and observed for 5 years. They were divided according to the amount of U-Col4 or urinary albumin excreted. The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. In participants with eGFR ≥80 mL/min, abnormal U-Col4 excretion was indicated as a significant independent risk factor for 10% eGFR change per year, which is one of the prognostic factors for the development of end-stage kidney disease. Moreover, in contrast to urinary albumin excretion, U-Col4 excretion was not related to age or kidney function, suggesting that some individuals with abnormal U-Col4 excretion can have an independent hidden risk for the development of kidney dysfunction. In conclusion, it is important to measure U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes to determine changes in renal features in every individual and help detect future complications such as diabetic kidney disease. If U-Col4 excretion is abnormal, kidney manifestation should be carefully followed up, even if the kidney function and urinalysis findings are normal.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a4d1fbb0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fumi Kishi, Kojiro Nagai, Norimichi Takamatsu, Tatsuya Tominaga, Masanori Tamaki, Eriko Shibata, Taichi Murakami, Seiji Kishi, Hideharu Abe, Yasuhiko Koezuka, Naoto Minagawa, Go Ichien, Toshio Doi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;PPAR-gamma (γ) is highly expressed in macrophages and its activation affects their polarization. The effect of PPAR-γ activation on Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) has not yet been evaluated. We investigated the effect of PPAR-γ activation on KC-polarization and IRI.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy percent (70%) liver ischemia was induced for 60mins. PPAR-γ-agonist or vehicle was administrated before reperfusion. PPAR-γ-antagonist was used to block PPAR-γ activation. Liver injury, necrosis, and apoptosis were assessed post-reperfusion. Flow-cytometry determined KC-phenotypes (pro-inflammatory Nitric Oxide +, anti-inflammatory CD206+ and anti-inflammatory IL-10+).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liver injury assessed by serum AST was significantly decreased in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group at all time points post reperfusion (1hr: 3092±105 vs 4469±551; p = 0.042; 6hr: 7041±1160 vs 12193±1143; p = 0.015; 12hr: 5746±328 vs 8608±1259; p = 0.049). Furthermore, liver apoptosis measured by TUNEL-staining was significantly reduced in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group post reperfusion (1hr:2.46±0.49 vs 6.90±0.85%;p = 0.001; 6hr:26.40±2.93 vs 50.13±8.29%; p = 0.048). H&amp;amp;E staining demonstrated less necrosis in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (24hr:26.66±4.78 vs 45.62±4.57%; p = 0.032). The percentage of pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs was significantly lower at all post reperfusion time points in the PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (1hr:28.49±4.99 vs 53.54±9.15%; p = 0.040; 6hr:5.51±0.54 vs 31.12±9.58%; p = 0.009; 24hr:4.15±1.50 vs 17.10±4.77%; p = 0.043). In contrast, percentage of anti-inflammatory CD206+ KCs was significantly higher in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group prior to IRI (8.62±0.96 vs 4.88 ±0.50%; p = 0.04). Administration of PPAR-γ-antagonist reversed the beneficial effects on AST, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;PPAR-γ activation reduces IRI and decreases the pro-inflammatory NO+ Kupffer cells. PPAR-γ activation can become an important tool to improve outcomes in liver surgery through decreasing the pro-inflammatory phenotype of KCs and IRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3b96ee5f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Linares, Kaveh Farrokhi, Juan Echeverri, Johan Moritz Kaths, Dagmar Kollmann, Matyas Hamar, Peter Urbanellis, Sujani Ganesh, Oyedele A.

Mirror exposure (ME) is one of the main components of the treatment of patients with eating disorders symptomatology and it has shown its effectiveness in improving several outcomes (e.g., body dissatisfaction). However, the study as to what body posture should be adopted to maximize its effectiveness has been neglected. From embodied cognition and emotion theories, the adoption of an expansive (vs. contractive) body posture has been associated with positive changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of adopting an expansive (vs. contractive) posture before an ME task on body-related emotions and cognitions, as well as to analyze the possible moderator and mediator variables of these relationships. The sample was composed of 68 women (age: &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 21.74, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 3.12) with high scores on body dissatisfaction. Participants were randomly assigned to the expansive or contractive condition, where the openness of the arms/legs and the back position were manipulated. Posture was monitored by an electronic device and participants filled out several self-reported measures. ANCOVAs, moderation, mediation, and moderated mediated analyses were performed. Results showed that women in the expansive condition showed higher positive emotions after the ME. Moreover, exploratory analyses showed that adopting an expansive posture improved positive emotions, leading to improvements in negative emotions, body image satisfaction, and appraisal of the person’s own body. Psychological interventions should explore the value of holding an expansive posture before the ME in women with body dissatisfaction.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9fac8bb9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Miragall, Ernestina Etchemendy, Ausiàs Cebolla, Víctor Rodríguez, Carlos Medrano, Rosa María Baños&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; is a perennial herbaceous plant species mainly distributed in the tropics or subtropics of Asia and Africa. It has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time and now is utilized for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agriculture industries as a valued economic crop. Recently, &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; has attracted tremendous interest because of its high ceramide content. However, the breeding and genome studies are severely limited by the arduous whole genome sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, the transcriptome data of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by utilizing the high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. Based on this information, the majority of the significant genes involved in the proposed sphingolipid metabolic pathway were identified. Then, the full-length neutral ceramidase cDNA was obtained with the help of its candidate transcripts, which were acquired from the transcriptome data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this neutral ceramidase was a real ceramidase by eukaryotic expression in the yeast double knockout mutant Δypc1 Δydc1, which lacks the ceramidases—dihydroCDase (YDC1p), phytoCDase (YPC1p). In addition, the biochemical characterization of purified &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; ceramidase (AmCDase) exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an optimal activity ranging from pH 6.5 to 8.0. Based on our knowledge, this study is the first to report the related information of the neutral ceramidase in &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;. All datasets can provide significant information for related studies, such as gene expression, genetic improvement and application on breeding in &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5bea8ad4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin Zhong, Erxi Liu, Chaozhu Yang, Ying Diao, Nunung Harijati, Jiangdong Liu, Zhongli Hu, Surong Jin&lt;/p&gt;

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be overcome by electrical stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) via a cochlear implant (CI). Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between the SGNs and the electrode, but the efficacy of CI is also limited by the degeneration of SGNs as one consequence of SHNL. In the healthy cochlea, the survival of SGNs is assured by endogenous neurotrophic support. Several applications of exogenous neurotrophic supply have been shown to reduce SGN degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the present study, nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs), with an approximate diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, were loaded with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to test their efficacy as long-term delivery system for neurotrophins. The neurotrophic factor was released constantly from the NPSNPs over a release period of 80 days when the surface of the nanoparticles had been modified with amino groups. Cell culture investigations with NIH3T3 fibroblasts attest a good general cytocompatibility of the NPSNPs. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments with SGNs indicate a significantly higher survival rate of SGNs in cell cultures that contained BDNF-loaded nanoparticles compared to the control culture with unloaded NPSNPs (p&amp;lt;0.001). Importantly, also the amounts of BDNF released up to a time period of 39 days increased the survival rate of SGNs. Thus, NPSNPs carrying BDNF are suitable for the treatment of inner ear disease and for the protection and the support of SGNs. Their nanoscale nature and the fact that a direct contact of the nanoparticles and the SGNs is not necessary for neuroprotective effects, should allow for the facile preparation of nanocomposites, e.g., with biocompatible polymers, to install coatings on implants for the realization of implant-based growth factor delivery systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8ab24b99</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadeschda Schmidt, Jennifer Schulze, Dawid P.

Using atomic force microscopy–based single-molecule force spectroscopy, we explored the mechanical stability of the prototypical staphylococcal adhesin SdrG, which targets a short peptide from human fibrinogen β. Steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed, and single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments confirmed, the mechanism by which this complex withstands forces of over 2 nanonewtons, a regime previously associated with the strength of a covalent bond.

Using atomic force microscopy–based single-molecule force spectroscopy, we explored the mechanical stability of the prototypical staphylococcal adhesin SdrG, which targets a short peptide from human fibrinogen β. Steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed, and single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments confirmed, the mechanism by which this complex withstands forces of over 2 nanonewtons, a regime previously associated with the strength of a covalent bond.

The species distribution was &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, n = 66; &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; spp., n = 44; and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt;, n = 18. In 9 patients, carbapenem-resistant isolates belonging to more than one species were detected. Infection was diagnosed in 50 patients (total: 42.0%; nosocomial pneumonia: n = 23, 19.3%; bloodstream infection: n = 11, 9.2%). Antimicrobial treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to detection of a carbapenem-resistant isolate was documented in 105 patients (88.2%, prior administration of carbapenems: 62.2%). Nosocomial transmission was documented in 29 patients (24.4%). In 26 patients (21.8%), at least one carbapenem-susceptible, third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible isolate was documented prior to detection of a carbapenem-resistant isolate belonging to the same species (median 38 days, IQR 23–78). 12 patients (10.1%) had documented previous contact to the healthcare system in a country with high burden of carbapenemase-producing strains. Genes encoding carbapenemases were detected in 60/102 patient isolates (58.8%; VIM-2, n = 25; OXA-48, n = 21; OXA-23-like, n = 10). Susceptibility to colistin was 94.3%. Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam were administered to 3 and 5 patients, respectively (in-hospital mortality: 66% and 100%). Development of drug-resistance under therapy was observed for both antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;i) The major predisposing factors for acquisition of carbapenem-resistant MDR-GNB were selective pressure due to preceding antimicrobial therapy and nosocomial transmission. ii) Colistin remains the backbone of antimicrobial chemotherapy for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant MDR-GNB. iii) Novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations are of limited usefulness in our setting because of the high prevalence of Ambler class B carbapenemases and the emergence of nonsusceptibility under therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7e6e29db</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juri Katchanov, Lucia Asar, Eva-Maria Klupp, Anna Both, Camilla Rothe, Christina König, Holger Rohde, Stefan Kluge, Florian P.

Here, we studied the GRNs controlling the emergence of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from mouse embryonic endothelium using a combination of single-cell transcriptome assays. We found that a heptad of transcription factors (Runx1, Gata2, Tal1, Fli1, Lyl1, Erg and Lmo2) is specifically co-expressed in an intermediate population expressing both endothelial and hematopoietic markers. Within the heptad, we identified two sets of factors of opposing functions: one (Erg/Fli1) promoting the endothelial cell fate, the other (Runx1/Gata2) promoting the hematopoietic fate.

Here, we studied the GRNs controlling the emergence of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from mouse embryonic endothelium using a combination of single-cell transcriptome assays. We found that a heptad of transcription factors (Runx1, Gata2, Tal1, Fli1, Lyl1, Erg and Lmo2) is specifically co-expressed in an intermediate population expressing both endothelial and hematopoietic markers. Within the heptad, we identified two sets of factors of opposing functions: one (Erg/Fli1) promoting the endothelial cell fate, the other (Runx1/Gata2) promoting the hematopoietic fate. Surprisingly, our data suggest that even though Fli1 initially supports the endothelial cell fate, it acquires a pro-hematopoietic role when co-expressed with Runx1. This work demonstrates the power of single-cell RNA-sequencing for characterizing complex transcription factor dynamics.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1624272797c:2d116c5:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A genomics approach reveals insights into the importance of gene losses for mammalian adaptations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genomics approach reveals insights into the importance of gene losses for mammalian adaptations, Published online: 23 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03667-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03667-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Gene losses are generally considered detrimental, or at best neutral.

Background &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Japanese encephalitis virus&lt;/i&gt; (JEV) is a major cause of encephalitis in Asia, and the commonest cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis worldwide. Detection of JEV RNA remains challenging due to the characteristic brief and low viraemia, with 0–25% of patients positive, and the mainstay of diagnosis remains detection of anti-JEV IgM antibody.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review of published RT-PCR protocols, and evaluated them &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; alongside new primers and probes designed using a multiple genome alignment of all JEV strains &gt;9,000nt from GenBank, downloaded from the NCBI website (November 2016). The new assays included pan-genotype and genotype specific assays targeting genotypes 1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten RT-qPCR assays were compared, a pre-existing in-house assay, three published assays and six newly designed assays, using serial RNA dilutions. We selected three assays, one published and two novel assays, with the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for further optimisation and validation. One of the novel assays, detecting NS2A, showed the best results, with LOD approximately 4 copies/ reaction, and no cross-reaction on testing closely related viruses in the JEV serocomplex, &lt;i&gt;West Nile Virus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;St&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Louis Virus&lt;/i&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Japanese encephalitis virus&lt;/i&gt; (JEV) is a major cause of encephalitis in Asia, and the commonest cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis worldwide. Detection of JEV RNA remains challenging due to the characteristic brief and low viraemia, with 0–25% of patients positive, and the mainstay of diagnosis remains detection of anti-JEV IgM antibody.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review of published RT-PCR protocols, and evaluated them &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; alongside new primers and probes designed using a multiple genome alignment of all JEV strains &gt;9,000nt from GenBank, downloaded from the NCBI website (November 2016). The new assays included pan-genotype and genotype specific assays targeting genotypes 1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten RT-qPCR assays were compared, a pre-existing in-house assay, three published assays and six newly designed assays, using serial RNA dilutions. We selected three assays, one published and two novel assays, with the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for further optimisation and validation. One of the novel assays, detecting NS2A, showed the best results, with LOD approximately 4 copies/ reaction, and no cross-reaction on testing closely related viruses in the JEV serocomplex, &lt;i&gt;West Nile Virus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;St&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Louis Virus&lt;/i&gt;. The optimised assays were validated in consecutive patients with central nervous system infections admitted to hospitals in Laos, testing paired CSF and serum samples.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We succeeded in developing a JEV specific RT-qPCR assay with at least 1 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; improved sensitivity as compared to existing assays. Further evaluation is required, field-testing the assay in a larger group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194412</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194412</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Development of an improved RT-qPCR Assay for detection of &amp;lt;i&gt;Japanese encephalitis virus&amp;lt;/i&gt; (JEV) RNA including a systematic review and comprehensive comparison with published methods</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><published>1521838800000</published><author><name>Tehmina Bharucha</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194412</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194412</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c6:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mateo Prochazka, Larissa Otero, Kelika A.

Patient-nominated supporters can potentially improve the continuum of HIV care. We retrospectively determined factors associated with having a patient-nominated supporter among people living with HIV (PLWH), and its association with retention in care and viral suppression. We analysed registries of adults evaluated by social workers (n = 1345) at a referral hospital in Peru between 2011–2014. Nondisclosure of HIV status was associated with lacking supporters (aPR: 5.41, 95% CI: 3.83–7.64). Retention in care was 76.4% and 34.2% after one and two years of enrolment, respectively. PLWH with supporters were more likely to be retained in care after two years (aRR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02–1.81), but not after one year (aRR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.98–1.23) compared to PLWH without supporters. Having supporters who were parents or friends was associated with an increased probability of being retained in care after one and two years of enrolment. Viral suppression after one year of enrolment was 58.7%. Having a supporter was not associated with viral suppression (aRR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.99–1.41), but PLWH with supporters were more likely to have viral load measurements (p = 0.005). Patient-nominated supporters appear beneficial for engagement in HIV care; these benefits may be related to the nature of their relationship with PLWH.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9c6e7c3d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mateo Prochazka, Larissa Otero, Kelika A.

In recent years, acupuncture has gained in popularity worldwide. However, recent epidemiological studies are lacking. We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients who were female, were middle-aged, resided in highly urbanized areas and suffered from injury or disorders of the musculoskeletal system were prone to more frequent acupuncture use. Our study revealed that the utilization of acupuncture became increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. Our findings may provide useful information for clinical practice and research as well as for health policy decision making.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>95378d3e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mei-Yao Wu, Yu-Chen Lee, Cheng-Li Lin, Ming-Cheng Huang, Mao-Feng Sun, Hung-Rong Yen&lt;/p&gt;

Previous research has linked the use of certain emotion regulation strategies to the vicarious experience of personal distress (PD) and empathic concern (EC). However, it has not yet been tested whether (1) vicarious PD is positively associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, (2) vicarious EC is positively associated with adaptive emotion regulation strategies or whether (3) PD and EC mediate the link between emotion regulation and reports of approach/avoidance in response to a person in distress. To that end, we assessed people’s reports of PD (i.e., anxious, troubled and upset) and EC (i.e., concerned, sympathetic and soft-hearted) in response to a video depicting a person in a threatening situation (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 78). Afterwards, we assessed participants’ reports of avoidance and approach with regard to the character and their disposition to use maladaptive and adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Results showed that both PD and EC were positively related to maladaptive strategies and negatively related to adaptive strategies, and that the association between maladaptive regulation strategies (i.e., rumination) and the willingness to avoid the person in distress was mediated by reports of greater PD. This study thus expands previous evidence on the relationship between maladaptive regulation strategies and affective empathy and provides novel insights into the main role that PD plays in the association between maladaptive strategies and social avoidance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a37b37d3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Delphine Grynberg, Belén López-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

This study thus expands previous evidence on the relationship between maladaptive regulation strategies and affective empathy and provides novel insights into the main role that PD plays in the association between maladaptive strategies and social avoidance.</description><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194248</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194248</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Facing others’ misfortune: Personal distress mediates the association between maladaptive emotion regulation and social avoidance</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><published>1521666000000</published><author><name>Delphine Grynberg</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194248</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194248</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e0:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susumu Yamaguchi, Nobutaka Horie, Minoru Morikawa, Yohei Tateishi, Takeshi Hiu, Yoichi Morofuji, Tsuyoshi Izumo, Kentaro Hayashi, Takayuki Matsuo&lt;/p&gt;
Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records—including SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—of consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI. SWAN- and DWI-based mASPECTSs were calculated, and correlations between DWI-SWAN mismatches with final infarct lesions or clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 35 patients included in this study, we confirmed cardioembolic stroke in 26, atherothrombotic stroke in 4, and unknown stroke etiology in 5. Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient&apos;s age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization. Assessment of ischemic lesions from the venous side appears to be useful for considering the etiology and revascularization therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>842f3c7b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susumu Yamaguchi, Nobutaka Horie, Minoru Morikawa, Yohei Tateishi, Takeshi Hiu, Yoichi Morofuji, Tsuyoshi Izumo, Kentaro Hayashi, Takayuki Matsuo&lt;/p&gt;

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, fatal manifestation of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS). Some patients with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis undergo lung transplantation despite their disease-associated bleeding tendency; others die while awaiting donor organs. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical management and outcomes of a cohort with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis who were evaluated for lung transplantation. Six patients with HPS-1 pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and one of two regional lung transplant centers. Their median age was 41.5 years pre-transplant. Three of six patients died without receiving a lung transplant. One of these was referred with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis and died before a donor organ became available, and donor organs were not identified for two other patients sensitized from prior blood product transfusions. Three of six patients received bilateral lung transplants; they did not have a history of excessive bleeding. One patient received peri-operative desmopressin, one was transfused with intra-operative platelets, and one received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intra-operative prothrombin complex concentrate, platelet transfusion, and desmopressin. One transplant recipient experienced acute rejection that responded to pulsed steroids. No evidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction or recurrence of HPS pulmonary fibrosis was detected up to 6 years post-transplant in these three lung transplant recipients. In conclusion, lung transplantation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are viable options for patients with HPS pulmonary fibrosis. Alloimmunization in HPS patients is an important and potentially preventable barrier to lung transplantation; interventions to limit alloimmunization should be implemented in HPS patients at risk of pulmonary fibrosis to optimize their candidacy for future lung transplants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d4eb2434</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Souheil El-Chemaly, Kevin J.

We have previously shown that low frequency ultrasound can release biomarkers from cells into the murine circulation enabling an amplification and localization of the released biomarker that could be used as a blood-based method to detect cancer earlier and monitor therapy. In this study, we further demonstrate that this technique could be used for characterization of tumors and/or identification of cellular masses of unknown origin due to the release of multiple protein and nucleic acid biomarkers in cells in culture, mice and patients. We sonicated colon (LS174T) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cell lines in culture at a low frequency of 1 MHz and show that there were several-fold changes in multiple protein and microRNA (miRNA) abundance with treatment at various intensities and time. This release was dependent on the duration and intensity of the sonication for both cell lines. Significant increased release in biomarkers was also observed following tumor sonication in living mice bearing subcutaneous LS174T cell line xenografts (for proteins and nucleic acids) and in an experimental LS174T liver tumor model (for proteins only). Finally, we demonstrated this methodology of multiple biomarker release in patients undergoing ablation of uterine fibroids using MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound. Two protein biomarkers significantly increased in the plasma after the ultrasound treatment in 21 samples tested. This proof that ultrasound-amplification method works in soft tissue tumor models together with biomarker multiplexing, could allow for an effective non-invasive method for identification, characterization and localization of incidental lesions, cancer and other disease. Pre-treatment quantification of the biomarkers, allows for individualization of quantitative comparisons. This individualization of normal marker levels in this method allows for specificity of the biomarker-increase to each patient, tumor or organ being studied.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>606ad7ca</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aloma L.

Gut bacterial communities have been shown to be influenced by diet, host phylogeny and anatomy, but most of these studies have been done in captive animals. Here we compare the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of wild birds. We characterized the gizzard and intestinal microbiota among 8 wild Neotropical bird species, granivorous or frugivorous species of the orders Columbiformes and Passeriformes. We sequenced the V4 region of the &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene in 94 collected samples from 32 wild birds from 5 localities, and compared bacterial communities by foraging guild, organ, locality and bird taxonomy. &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene-based sequencing data were examined using QIIME with linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and metabolic pathways were predicted using PICRUSt algorism. We identified 8 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Beta diversity analyses indicated significant separation of gut communities by bird orders (Columbiformes vs. Passerifomes) and between bird species (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In lower intestine, PICRUSt shows a predominance of carbohydrate metabolism in granivorous birds and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in frugivorous birds.

Gut bacterial communities have been shown to be influenced by diet, host phylogeny and anatomy, but most of these studies have been done in captive animals. Here we compare the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of wild birds. We characterized the gizzard and intestinal microbiota among 8 wild Neotropical bird species, granivorous or frugivorous species of the orders Columbiformes and Passeriformes. We sequenced the V4 region of the &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene in 94 collected samples from 32 wild birds from 5 localities, and compared bacterial communities by foraging guild, organ, locality and bird taxonomy. &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene-based sequencing data were examined using QIIME with linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and metabolic pathways were predicted using PICRUSt algorism. We identified 8 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Beta diversity analyses indicated significant separation of gut communities by bird orders (Columbiformes vs. Passerifomes) and between bird species (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In lower intestine, PICRUSt shows a predominance of carbohydrate metabolism in granivorous birds and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in frugivorous birds. Gizzard microbiota was significantly richer in granivorous, in relation to frugivorous birds (Chao 1; non-parametric t-test, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), suggesting a microbial gizzard function, beyond grinding food. The results suggest that the most important factor separating the bacterial community structure was bird taxonomy, followed by foraging guild. However, variation between localities is also likely to be important, but this could not been assessed with our study design.</description><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194857</href></item></alternate><engagement>10</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194857</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Comparison of gizzard and intestinal microbiota of wild neotropical birds</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><published>1522098000000</published><author><name>M.

Insulin is a vital part of diabetes treatment, whereas glucagon is primarily used to treat insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, glucagon is suggested to have a central role in the regulation of body weight, which would be beneficial for diabetic patients. Since the glucagon effect on blood glucose is known to be transient, it is relevant to investigate the pharmacodynamics of glucagon after repeated dosing. In the present study, we used telemetry to continuously measure blood glucose in streptozotocin induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. This allowed for a more detailed analysis of glucose regulation compared to intermittent blood sampling. In particular, we evaluated the blood glucose-lowering effect of different insulin doses alone, and in combination with a long acting glucagon analog (LAG). We showed how the effect of the LAG accumulated and persisted over time. Furthermore, we found that addition of the LAG decreased body weight without affecting food intake.
In a subsequent study, we focused on the glucagon effect on body weight and food intake during equal glycemic control. In order to obtain comparable maximum blood glucose lowering effect to insulin alone, the insulin dose had to be increased four times in combination with 1 nmol/kg of the LAG. In this set-up the LAG prevented further increase in body weight despite the four times higher insulin-dose. However, the body composition was changed. The insulin group increased both lean and fat mass, whereas the group receiving four times insulin in combination with the LAG only significantly increased the fat mass. No differences were observed in food intake, suggesting a direct effect on energy expenditure by glucagon. Surprisingly, we observed decreased levels of FGF21 in plasma compared to insulin treatment alone. With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7444c4b7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christina Pedersen, Trine Porsgaard, Maria Thomsen, Mette Marie Rosenkilde, Nikolaj Kulahin Roed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Talaromyces&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Penicillium&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; is a thermally dimorphic fungus that can cause opportunistic systemic mycoses in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It has also been reported among patients with other causes of immunodeficiency, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer, organ transplanted patients receiving immunosuppressive drug and adult onset immunodeficiency syndromes. Recent studies indicate that the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and treatment strategies of talaromycosis (penicilliosis) marneffei are different between patients with and without HIV infection. Therefore early and accurate diagnosis of talaromycosis marneffei is crucial to the proper management and treatment. Since current diagnostic methods are currently inadequate, the aim of this study was to develop an immunochromatographic test (ICT) for the detection of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; yeast antigens in urine samples. The highly &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei-&lt;/i&gt;specific monoclonal antibody 4D1 (MAb 4D1) conjugated with gold colloid at pH 6.5 was used as signal generator. The nitrocellulose membrane was lined with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; cytoplasmic yeast antigen (TM CYA) to serve as the test line, and rabbit anti-mouse IgG was the control line. Subjecting the assembled test strip to urine samples containing &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; antigen produced a visible result within 20 minutes. The sensitivity limit of the assay was 3.125μg/ml of TM CYA. The ICT was used to test urine samples from 66 patients with blood culture confirmed talaromycosis marneffei, 42 patients with other fungal or bacterial infections, and 70 normal healthy individuals from endemic area of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt;. The test exhibited sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 87.87%, 100% and 95.5%, respectively.

We present a general framework capable of predicting genes with similar tissue-wide expression patterns from activated or repressed TF targets using machine learning to combine TF binding and epigenetic features. Methods: Genes with correlated expression patterns across 53 tissues were identified according to their Bray-Curtis similarity.

Sunscreen users are often inadequately protected and become sunburned. This study aimed to investigate how much two consecutive sunscreen applications increased the quantity of sunscreen applied and decreased the skin area left without sunscreen (missed area) compared to a single application. Thirty-one healthy volunteers wearing swimwear were included and applied sunscreen two consecutive times in a laboratory environment. Participants had pictures taken in black light before and after each application. As sunscreens absorb black light, the darkness of the skin increased with increasing amounts of sunscreen applied. We conducted a standard curve establishing a link between change in picture darkness and quantity of sunscreen. The quantity of sunscreen at selected skin sites as well as the percentage of missed area was determined after each application. Participants had missed a median of 20% of their available body surface after a single application. After double application they had missed 9%. The decrease in missed areas was significant for the whole body surface and for each of the body regions separately. The median participant had applied between 13% and 100% more sunscreen at the selected skin sites after double application than after single application. We recommend double application, especially before intense sun exposure.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ad78f125</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ida M.

Recent data suggest the existence of a complement alternative pathway activation in the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a condition that remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f834d69c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Deshayes, Achille Aouba, Kathy Khoy, Delphine Mariotte, Thierry Lobbedez, Nicolas Martin Silva&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (ASSNAC) was shown in our previous study to activate Nrf2-mediated processes and increase glutathione level and resistance to oxidative stress in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we explored the antioxidant protective effect of ASSNAC in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans)&lt;/i&gt;. Treatment of &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours).

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (ASSNAC) was shown in our previous study to activate Nrf2-mediated processes and increase glutathione level and resistance to oxidative stress in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we explored the antioxidant protective effect of ASSNAC in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans)&lt;/i&gt;. Treatment of &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours). In addition, ASSNAC (2 mM; 24 hours) treatment of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; strains N2 (wild type strain), &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter (CL2166) and temperature sensitive sterile strain (CF512) significantly increased GST enzyme activity by 1.9-, 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively.

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure.

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs.

To unveil novel global changes associated with corpus luteum (CL) maturation, we analyzed transcriptome data for the bovine CL on days 4 and 11, representing the developing vs. mature gland. Our analyses revealed 681 differentially expressed genes (363 and 318 on day 4 and 11, respectively), with ≥2 fold change and FDR of &amp;lt;5%. Different gene ontology (GO) categories were represented prominently in transcriptome data at these stages (e.g. days 4: cell cycle, chromosome, DNA metabolic process and replication and on day 11: immune response; lipid metabolic process and complement activation). Based on bioinformatic analyses, select genes expression in day 4 and 11 CL was validated with quantitative real-time PCR. Cell specific expression was also determined in enriched luteal endothelial and steroidogenic cells. Genes related to the angiogenic process such as &lt;i&gt;NOS3&lt;/i&gt;, which maintains dilated vessels and &lt;i&gt;MMP9&lt;/i&gt;, matrix degrading enzyme, were higher on day 4. Importantly, our data suggests day 11 CL acquire mechanisms to prevent blood vessel sprouting and promote their maturation by expressing &lt;i&gt;NOTCH4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JAG1&lt;/i&gt;, greatly enriched in luteal endothelial cells. Another endothelial specific gene, &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt;, was identified here in the CL for the first time. &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt; is an adhesion molecule enabling lymphocyte migration, its higher levels at mid cycle are expected to support the transmigration of immune cells into the CL at this stage. Together with steroidogenic genes, most of the genes regulating de-novo cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (e.g &lt;i&gt;HMGCS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HMGCR&lt;/i&gt;) and cholesterol uptake from plasma (&lt;i&gt;LDLR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) were upregulated in the mature CL. These findings provide new insight of the processes involved in CL maturation including blood vessel growth and stabilization, leucocyte transmigration as well as progesterone synthesis as the CL matures.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>98bfe610</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sigal Kfir, Raghavendra Basavaraja, Noa Wigoda, Shifra Ben-Dor, Irit Orr, Rina Meidan&lt;/p&gt;

The quality of biological samples greatly affects the accuracy of scientific results. However, RNA in cryopreserved tissues gradually degrades during storage, leading to errors in the results of subsequent experiments. A suitable sample preservative solution can prolong storage and enhance the research value of samples. Here, we developed a sample preservative solution using the properties of the ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC) and compared its effects on RNA and DNA quality, protein activity, and tissue morphology with the commercially available and widely used RNAlater® Stabilization Solution. The results showed that both the RVC-based preservative solution and RNAlater can effectively delay RNA degradation in tissue samples stored at 4°C or −80°C compared with samples stored without any preservative solution. In contrast to RNAlater, the RVC-based preservative solution did not result in damage to the tissue morphology or a loss of protein activity. Additionally, the RVC-based preservative solution did not affect the RNA and genomic DNA contents of the tissue samples or the results of subsequent experimental analyses. An RVC-based reagent can be used as a multifunctional yet relatively inexpensive tissue preservative solution to provide a comprehensive and cost-effective method for preserving samples for tissue banks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4fd8268</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tzong-Ming Shieh, Chi-Yuan Chen, Chuen Hsueh, Cheng-Chia Yu, Chin-Chuan Chen, Tong-Hong Wang&lt;/p&gt;

The results showed that both the RVC-based preservative solution and RNAlater can effectively delay RNA degradation in tissue samples stored at 4°C or −80°C compared with samples stored without any preservative solution. In contrast to RNAlater, the RVC-based preservative solution did not result in damage to the tissue morphology or a loss of protein activity. Additionally, the RVC-based preservative solution did not affect the RNA and genomic DNA contents of the tissue samples or the results of subsequent experimental analyses. An RVC-based reagent can be used as a multifunctional yet relatively inexpensive tissue preservative solution to provide a comprehensive and cost-effective method for preserving samples for tissue banks.</description><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Application of ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC) for developing a multifunctional tissue preservative solution</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><published>1521061200000</published><author><name>Tzong-Ming Shieh</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e33a2:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-526b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/rHJ2uFaIUnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>295b60f4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-526b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/rHJ2uFaIUnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523374986362</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/rHJ2uFaIUnU/nm0418-526b</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions</title><unread>True</unread><published>1523343600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b</href></item></canonical><author><name>Hamid Bolouri</name></author><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b</originId><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_162b039947a:1dcc85e:923c4a60</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shohei Nozaki, Yohei Katoh, Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuhisa Nakayama&lt;/p&gt;
Protein trafficking within cilia is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery composed of large protein complexes. The BBSome consists of eight BBS proteins encoded by causative genes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and has been implicated in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by connecting the IFT machinery to cargo GPCRs. Membrane recruitment of the BBSome to promote cargo trafficking has been proposed to be regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase ARL6/BBS3, through its interaction with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome. We here investigated how the BBSome core subcomplex composed of BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 assembles and interacts with ARL6, and found that the ARL6–BBS1 interaction is reinforced by BBS9. &lt;i&gt;BBS1&lt;/i&gt;-knockout (KO) cells showed defects in the ciliary entry of other BBSome subunits and ARL6, and in ciliary retrograde trafficking and the export of the GPCRs, Smoothened and GPR161. The trafficking defect of these GPCRs was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type BBS1, but not by its mutant lacking BBS9-binding ability. Our data thus indicate that the intact BBSome is required for retrograde trafficking of GPCRs out of cilia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>761ea815</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shohei Nozaki, Yohei Katoh, Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuhisa Nakayama&lt;/p&gt;

The use of antimicrobial monomers, linked to the polymer chain of resin composites, is an interesting approach to circumvent the effects of bacteria on the dental and material surfaces.

Increasing evidence indicates that the Golgi apparatus plays active roles in cancer, but a comprehensive understanding of its functions in the oncogenic transformation has not yet emerged. At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipid biosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, we analyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. We disrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as in increased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin D or Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4838f225</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charlotte Luchsinger, Marcelo Aguilar, Patricia V.

Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy.</description><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195401</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195401</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Functional disruption of the Golgi apparatus protein ARF1 sensitizes MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to the antitumor drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine through ERK and AKT signaling</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><published>1522789200000</published><author><name>Charlotte Luchsinger</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195401</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195401</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6f:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unexpected Crossover in the kinetics of mutarotation in the supercooled region: the role of H-bonds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpected Crossover in the kinetics of mutarotation in the supercooled region: the role of H-bonds, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23117-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23117-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Unexpected Crossover in the kinetics of mutarotation in the supercooled region: the role of H-bonds&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/IYmBiky3h4s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>598fb3a6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unexpected Crossover in the kinetics of mutarotation in the supercooled region: the role of H-bonds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpected Crossover in the kinetics of mutarotation in the supercooled region: the role of H-bonds, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23117-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23117-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Unexpected Crossover in the kinetics of mutarotation in the supercooled region: the role of H-bonds&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/IYmBiky3h4s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1522228628665</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/IYmBiky3h4s/s41598-018-23117-8</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23117-8</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Unexpected Crossover in the kinetics of mutarotation in the supercooled region: the role of H-bonds</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522220400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23117-8</href></item></canonical><author><name>K.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes. HFD mice showed increments in colonic MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, as well as a decrease in &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in both colonic and epididymal tissues. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in SP and iNOS expression in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice. In preparations from HFD mice, electrically evoked contractions upon NOS blockade or mediated by tachykininergic stimulation were enhanced. In HFD mice, Apigenin counteracted the increase in body and epididymal fat weight, as well as the alterations of metabolic indexes. Apigenin reduced also MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 colonic levels as well as eosinophil infiltration, SP and iNOS expression, along with a normalization of electrically evoked tachykininergic and nitrergic contractions. In addition, apigenin normalized &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in epididymal fat tissues, but not in colonic specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions and implications &lt;p&gt;Apigenin prevents systemic metabolic alterations, counteracts enteric inflammation and normalizes colonic dysmotility associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bd7e623b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Gentile, Matteo Fornai, Rocchina Colucci, Carolina Pellegrini, Erika Tirotta, Laura Benvenuti, Cristina Segnani, Chiara Ippolito, Emiliano Duranti, Agostino Virdis, Sara Carpi, Paola Nieri, Zoltán H.

Patients were divided into DM and non-DM groups (1,135 and 1,749 patients, respectively). GERD was diagnosed endoscopically and graded according to the Los Angeles classification. Grade B or more severe GERD was defined as severe endoscopic GERD. The intergroup GSRS score was compared statistically.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In severe endoscopic GERD patients, the prevalence of patients with a positive GSRS score in the acid regurgitation question was statistically lower in DM patients than non-DM patients. Of the 60 non-DM patients with severe endoscopic GERD, 40 patients (67%) had a positive GSRS score for acid regurgitation; however, of the 51 DM patients with severe endoscopic GERD, 23 patients (45%) had a positive GSRS score. Multivariate analysis showed that severe endoscopic GERD (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.21–3.33; p = 0.0066), non-DM (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.54–0.94; p = 0.0157), younger age (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97–0.99; p = 0.0125), and hiatal hernia (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.12–1.90; p = 0.0042) were associated with acid regurgitation symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a discrepancy between subjective symptoms and endoscopic GERD grade in DM patients.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atypical meningiomas are common central nervous system neoplasms with high recurrence rate and poorer prognosis compared to their grade I counterparts. Surgical excision and radiotherapy remains the mainstay therapy but medical treatments are limited. We explore new drug candidates using computational drug repurposing based on the gene expression signature of atypical meningioma tissue with subsequent analysis of drug-generated expression profiles. We further explore possible mechanisms of action for the identified drug candidates using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted gene expression profiles for atypical meningiomas (12 samples) and normal meningeal tissue (4 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which were then used to generate a gene signature comprising of 281 differentially expressed genes. Drug candidates were explored using both the Board Institute Connectivity Map (cmap) and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). Functional analysis of significant differential gene expression for drug candidates was performed with IPA.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using our integrated approach, we identified multiple, already licensed, drug candidates such as emetine, verteporfin, phenoxybenzamine and trazodone. Analysis with IPA revealed that these drugs target signal cascades potentially relevant in pathogenesis of meningiomas, particular examples are the effect on ERK by trazodone, MAP kinases by emetine, and YAP-1 protein by verteporfin.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Gene expression profiling and use of drug expression profiles have yielded several plausible drug candidates for treating atypical meningioma, some of which have already been suggested by preceding studies. Although our analyses suggested multiple anti-tumour mechanisms for these drugs, further &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies are required for validation.&lt;/p&gt; Importance of the study &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge this is the first study which combines relatively new, yet established computational techniques to identify additional treatments for a difficult to manage cerebral neoplasm.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the effects of dopaminergic interventions on pain remains questionable.

The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively).

Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>845996b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by May Haddad, Dorit Pud, Roi Treister, Erica Suzan, Elon Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Estimation of visibility bias is critical to accurately compute abundance of wild populations. The franciscana, &lt;i&gt;Pontoporia blainvillei&lt;/i&gt;, is considered the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Aerial surveys are considered the most effective method to estimate abundance of this species, but many existing estimates have been considered unreliable because they lack proper estimation of correction factors for visibility bias. In this study, helicopter surveys were conducted to determine surfacing-diving intervals of franciscanas and to estimate availability for aerial platforms. Fifteen hours were flown and 101 groups of 1 to 7 franciscanas were monitored, resulting in a sample of 248 surface-dive cycles. The mean surfacing interval and diving interval times were 16.10 seconds (SE = 9.74) and 39.77 seconds (SE = 29.06), respectively. Availability was estimated at 0.39 (SE = 0.01), a value 16–46% greater than estimates computed from diving parameters obtained from boats or from land. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to investigate the influence of biological and environmental predictors on the proportion of time franciscana groups are visually available to be seen from an aerial platform. These models revealed that group size was the main factor influencing the proportion at surface. The use of negatively biased estimates of availability results in overestimation of abundance, leads to overly optimistic assessments of extinction probabilities and to potentially ineffective management actions. This study demonstrates that estimates of availability must be computed from suitable platforms to ensure proper conservation decisions are implemented to protect threatened species such as the franciscana.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>feee6ace</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Sucunza, Daniel Danilewicz, Marta Cremer, Artur Andriolo, Alexandre N.

Estimation of visibility bias is critical to accurately compute abundance of wild populations. The franciscana, &lt;i&gt;Pontoporia blainvillei&lt;/i&gt;, is considered the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Aerial surveys are considered the most effective method to estimate abundance of this species, but many existing estimates have been considered unreliable because they lack proper estimation of correction factors for visibility bias. In this study, helicopter surveys were conducted to determine surfacing-diving intervals of franciscanas and to estimate availability for aerial platforms. Fifteen hours were flown and 101 groups of 1 to 7 franciscanas were monitored, resulting in a sample of 248 surface-dive cycles. The mean surfacing interval and diving interval times were 16.10 seconds (SE = 9.74) and 39.77 seconds (SE = 29.06), respectively.

Repetitive DNA represents the major component of the genome in both plant and animal species. It includes transposable elements (TEs), which are dispersed throughout the genome, and satellite DNAs (satDNAs), which are tandemly organized in long arrays. The study of the structure and organization of repetitive DNA contributes to our understanding of genome architecture and the mechanisms leading to its evolution. Molluscs represent one of the largest groups of invertebrates and include organisms with a wide variety of morphologies and lifestyles. To increase our knowledge of bivalves at the genome level, we analysed the Antarctic scallop &lt;i&gt;Adamussium colbecki&lt;/i&gt;. The screening of the genomic library evidenced the presence of two novel satDNA elements and the CvA transposon.

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings. However, tactile suppression was comparable between conditions arguing against the hypothesis that it frees capacities for processing other relevant visual signals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ba854dbd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;

to fuels is required to enable the production of sustainable fuels and to
contribute to alleviating CO2 emissions. In considering conversion
of CO2, the initial step of adsorption and activation by the catalyst
is crucial. In addressing this difficult problem, we have examined how
nanoclusters of reducible metal oxides supported on TiO2 can promote
CO2 activation. In this paper we present density functional theory
(DFT) simulations of CO2 activation on heterostructures composed of extended
rutile and anatase TiO2 surfaces modified with chromia nanoclusters.
The heterostructures show non-bulk Cr and O sites in the nanoclusters and an
upshifted valence band edge that is dominated by Cr 3d- O 2p interactions. We
show that the supported chromia nanoclusters can adsorb and activate CO2 and
that activation of CO2 is promoted whether the TiO2
support is oxidised or hydroxylated. Reduced heterostructures, formed by
removal of oxygen from the chromia nanocluster, also promote CO2
activation. In the strong CO2 adsorption modes, the molecule bends
giving O-C-O angles of 127 - 132o and elongation of C-O distances up
to 1.30 Å; no carbonates are formed. The electronic properties show a strong CO2-Cr-O
interaction that drives the interaction of CO2 with the nanocluster
and induces the structural distortions. These results highlight that a metal
oxide support modified with reducible metal oxide nanoclusters can activate CO2,

to fuels is required to enable the production of sustainable fuels and to
contribute to alleviating CO2 emissions. In considering conversion
of CO2, the initial step of adsorption and activation by the catalyst
is crucial. In addressing this difficult problem, we have examined how
nanoclusters of reducible metal oxides supported on TiO2 can promote
CO2 activation. In this paper we present density functional theory
(DFT) simulations of CO2 activation on heterostructures composed of extended
rutile and anatase TiO2 surfaces modified with chromia nanoclusters.
The heterostructures show non-bulk Cr and O sites in the nanoclusters and an
upshifted valence band edge that is dominated by Cr 3d- O 2p interactions. We
show that the supported chromia nanoclusters can adsorb and activate CO2 and
that activation of CO2 is promoted whether the TiO2
support is oxidised or hydroxylated. Reduced heterostructures, formed by
removal of oxygen from the chromia nanocluster, also promote CO2
activation. In the strong CO2 adsorption modes, the molecule bends
giving O-C-O angles of 127 - 132o and elongation of C-O distances up
to 1.30 Å; no carbonates are formed. The electronic properties show a strong CO2-Cr-O
interaction that drives the interaction of CO2 with the nanocluster
and induces the structural distortions. These results highlight that a metal
oxide support modified with reducible metal oxide nanoclusters can activate CO2,
thus helping to overcome difficulties associated with the difficult first step
in CO2 conversion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16262fca69e:5bafa10:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>707b2c65</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021407?af=R</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021407?af=R</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>NH3 adsorption on anatase-TiO2(101)</title><unread>True</unread><published>1521777529000</published><author><name>Stig Koust</name></author><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021407?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88f4:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><author><name>Andrew Kaufman</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Kaufman, Ezen Choo, Anna Koh, Robin Dando&lt;/p&gt;
Despite evidence that the ability to taste is weakened by obesity and can be rescued with weight loss intervention, few studies have investigated the molecular effects of obesity on the taste system. Taste bud cells undergo continual turnover even in adulthood, exhibiting an average life span of only a few weeks, tightly controlled by a balance of proliferation and cell death. Recent data reveal that an acute inflammation event can alter this balance. We demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OTfX7eySHIY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Kaufman, Ezen Choo, Anna Koh, Robin Dando&lt;/p&gt;

CHO intake was set at 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes. Blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Each of the CHO trials (CAV, MIY, SUG) compared to water was associated with higher post-exercise plasma glucose and fructose, and lower leukocyte counts, plasma 9+13 HODES, and IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra. OPLS-DA analysis showed that metabolic perturbation (N = 1,605 metabolites) for WAT (86.8±4.0 arbitrary units) was significantly greater and sustained than for CAV (70.4±3.9, P = 0.006), MIY (68.3±4.0, P = 0.002), and SUG (68.1±4.2, P = 0.002). VIP ranking (&amp;lt;3.0, N = 25 metabolites) showed that both CAV and MIY were associated with significant fold changes in metabolites including those from amino acid and xenobiotics pathways. OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts showed a significant separation of CAV and MIY from both WAT and SUG (R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409).

It is generally believed that the unencapsulated sensory nerve terminals of modality specific C- and Aδ-neurons lack structural specialization. Here we determined the morphology of functionally defined polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors in the guinea pig corneal epithelium. Polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors were identified by extracellular recording at the surface of the corneal epithelium. After marking the recording sites, corneas were processed to reveal immunoreactivity for the transient receptor potential channels TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) or TPRM8 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8). Polymodal receptor nerve terminals (n = 6) were TRPV1-immunoreactive and derived from an axon that ascended from the sub-basal plexus to the squamous cell layer where it branched into fibers that ran parallel to the corneal surface and terminated with small bulbar endings (ramifying endings). Cold thermoreceptor nerve terminals were TRPM8-immunoreactive (n = 6) and originated from an axon that branched as it ascended through the wing cell and squamous cell layers and terminated with large bulbar endings (complex endings).

It is generally believed that the unencapsulated sensory nerve terminals of modality specific C- and Aδ-neurons lack structural specialization. Here we determined the morphology of functionally defined polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors in the guinea pig corneal epithelium. Polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors were identified by extracellular recording at the surface of the corneal epithelium. After marking the recording sites, corneas were processed to reveal immunoreactivity for the transient receptor potential channels TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) or TPRM8 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8). Polymodal receptor nerve terminals (n = 6) were TRPV1-immunoreactive and derived from an axon that ascended from the sub-basal plexus to the squamous cell layer where it branched into fibers that ran parallel to the corneal surface and terminated with small bulbar endings (ramifying endings). Cold thermoreceptor nerve terminals were TRPM8-immunoreactive (n = 6) and originated from an axon that branched as it ascended through the wing cell and squamous cell layers and terminated with large bulbar endings (complex endings). These findings indicate that modality specific corneal sensory neurons with unencapsulated nerve endings have distinct nerve terminal morphologies that are likely to relate to their function.</description><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195108</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195108</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>The neurochemistry and morphology of functionally identified corneal polymodal nociceptors and cold thermoreceptors</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><published>1522270800000</published><author><name>Abdulhakeem S.

Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of built-up areas for a wide range of applications. Recently developed approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of built-up areas using road network data. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard to different administrative regions and cities/towns. The results show that in most cases, the most-appropriate thresholds or ranges for different subdivisions are either identical or overlap—thus validating the use of the most-appropriate thresholds to delineate built-up areas for one or multiple small subdivisions and, by inference, for a much larger region.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4fd4a592</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qi Zhou, Lei Guo&lt;/p&gt;

This paper presents a switching PD-based sliding mode control (PD-SMC) method for the 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) hovering motion of the underwater robot with tilting thrusters. Four thrusters of robot can be tilted simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical directions, and the 6-DOF motion is achieved by switching between two thruster configurations. Therefore, the tilting speed of thruster becomes the most essential parameter to determine the stability of hovering motion. Even though the previous PD control ensures stable hovering motion within a certain ranges of tilting speed, a PD-SMC is suggested in this paper by combining PD control with sliding mode control in order to achieve acceptable hovering performance even at the much lower tilting speeds. Also, the sign function in the sliding mode control is replaced by a sigmoid function to reduce undesired chattering. Simulations show that while PD control is effective only for tilting duration of 600 ms, the PD-based sliding mode control can guarantee the stable hovering motion of underwater robot even for the tilting duration of up to 1500 ms. Extensive experimental results confirm the hovering performance of the proposed PD-SMC method is much superior to that of PD method for much larger tilting durations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4a9382e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sangrok Jin, Jeongae Bak, Jongwon Kim, TaeWon Seo, Hwa Soo Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Extensive experimental results confirm the hovering performance of the proposed PD-SMC method is much superior to that of PD method for much larger tilting durations.</description><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194427</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194427</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Switching PD-based sliding mode control for hovering of a tilting-thruster underwater robot</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><published>1521234000000</published><author><name>Sangrok Jin</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194427</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194427</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849ea:34f43e70</id></item><item><fingerprint>2aa486a7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00155/20180329/images/medium/ct-2018-001555_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00155&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Sepsis is characterized by an intense systemic inflammatory response activating a cascade of proinflammatory events resulting in leukocyte dysregulation and host tissue damage. The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic inflammation, leading to acute lung injury. Key to inflammation-induced lung damage is the excessive migration of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium. The mechanisms which regulate neutrophil activation and migration in sepsis are not well defined but there is growing evidence that platelets are actively involved and play a key role in microvascular permeability and neutrophil-mediated organ damage. We previously identified PKC-delta (PKCδ) as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis and demonstrated PKCδ inhibition was lung protective. However, the role of PKCδ in sepsis-induced platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions is not known. In this study, rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Following surgeries, a PKCδ inhibitor (200μg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered intra-tracheally. At 24 hours post-surgeries, lung tissue, BAL fluid, and blood samples were collected. While sepsis caused thrombocytopenia, the remaining circulating platelets were activated as demonstrated by increased p-selectin expression, elevated plasma PF4, and enhanced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation compared to Sham animals. Platelet activation was associated with increased platelet PKCδ activity. Inhibition of PKCδ attenuated sepsis-induced platelet activation, secretion and aggregate formation. Sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia was also significantly reduced and circulating platelet numbers were similar to sham animals. In the lung, sepsis induced significant influx of platelets and neutrophils and the development of lung injury. Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective.

Sepsis is characterized by an intense systemic inflammatory response activating a cascade of proinflammatory events resulting in leukocyte dysregulation and host tissue damage. The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic inflammation, leading to acute lung injury. Key to inflammation-induced lung damage is the excessive migration of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium. The mechanisms which regulate neutrophil activation and migration in sepsis are not well defined but there is growing evidence that platelets are actively involved and play a key role in microvascular permeability and neutrophil-mediated organ damage. We previously identified PKC-delta (PKCδ) as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis and demonstrated PKCδ inhibition was lung protective. However, the role of PKCδ in sepsis-induced platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions is not known. In this study, rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Following surgeries, a PKCδ inhibitor (200μg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered intra-tracheally. At 24 hours post-surgeries, lung tissue, BAL fluid, and blood samples were collected. While sepsis caused thrombocytopenia, the remaining circulating platelets were activated as demonstrated by increased p-selectin expression, elevated plasma PF4, and enhanced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation compared to Sham animals. Platelet activation was associated with increased platelet PKCδ activity. Inhibition of PKCδ attenuated sepsis-induced platelet activation, secretion and aggregate formation. Sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia was also significantly reduced and circulating platelet numbers were similar to sham animals. In the lung, sepsis induced significant influx of platelets and neutrophils and the development of lung injury. Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective. Thus, PKCδ inhibition modulated platelet activity both locally and systemically, decreased neutrophil influx into the lung, and was lung protective. We demonstrate for the first time that PKCδ plays an important role in platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil interaction during sepsis.</description><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Role of Protein Kinase C-delta in regulating platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interaction during sepsis</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><published>1522875600000</published><author><name>Elisabetta Liverani</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575fe:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Igor Mozetič, Luis Torgo, Vitor Cerqueira, Jasmina Smailović&lt;/p&gt;
Social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections, Brexit, stock market, etc. In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data. Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set). We find no significant difference between the best cross-validation and sequential validation. However, we observe that all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance, while the sequential methods tend to underestimate it. Standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>97e9bea5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Igor Mozetič, Luis Torgo, Vitor Cerqueira, Jasmina Smailović&lt;/p&gt;

Mosquitoes function as important vectors for many diseases globally and can have substantial negative economic, environmental, and health impacts. Specifically, West Nile virus (WNv) is a significant and increasing threat to wildlife populations and human health throughout North America. Mosquito control is an important means of controlling the spread of WNv, as the virus is primarily spread between avian and mosquito vectors. This is of particular concern for avian host species such as the Greater sage-grouse (&lt;i&gt;Centrocercus urophasianus&lt;/i&gt;), in which WNv negatively impacts fitness parameters. Most mosquito control methods focus on the larval stages. In North America, control efforts are largely limited to larvicides, which require repeated application and have potentially negative ecological impacts. There are multiple potential advantages to using indigenous fish species as an alternative for larval control including lowered environmental impact, decreased costs in terms of time and financial inputs, and the potential for the establishment of self-sustaining fish populations. We tested the efficacy of using fathead minnows (&lt;i&gt;Pimephales promelas&lt;/i&gt;) as biological control for mosquito populations in livestock reservoirs of semiarid rangelands. We introduced minnows into 10 treatment reservoirs and monitored an additional 6 non-treated reservoirs as controls over 3 years. Adult mosquitoes of species known to transmit WNv (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Culex tarsalis&lt;/i&gt;) were captured at each site and mosquito larvae were also present at all sites. Stable isotope analysis confirmed that introduced fathead minnows were feeding at the mosquito larvae trophic level in all but one treatment pond. Treatment ponds demonstrated suppressed levels of mosquito larva over each season compared to controls with a model-predicted 114% decrease in larva density within treatment ponds. Minnows established self-sustaining populations throughout the study in all reservoirs that maintained sufficient water levels. Minnow survival was not influenced by water quality. Though minnows did not completely eradicate mosquito larvae, minnows are a promising alternative to controlling mosquito larvae density within reservoirs. We caution that careful site selection is critical to avoid potential negative impacts, but suggest the introduction of fathead minnows in reservoirs can dramatically reduce mosquito larva abundance and potentially help mitigate vector-borne disease transmission.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7538efc3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryan T.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compare the axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and intraocular lens power (IOLP) of IOLMaster and Ultrasound in normal, long and short eyes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy-four normal eyes (≥ 22 mm and ≤ 25 mm), 74 long eyes (&gt; 25 mm) and 78 short eyes (&amp;lt; 22 mm) underwent AL and ACD measurements with both devices in the order of IOLMaster followed by Ultrasound. The IOLP were calculated using a free online LADAS IOL formula calculator.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The difference in AL and IOLP between IOLMaster and Ultrasound was statistically significant when all three groups were combined. The difference in ACD between IOLMaster and Ultrasound was statistically significant in the normal group (P&amp;lt;0.001) and short eye group (P&amp;lt;0.001) but not the long eye group (P = 0.465).

In this study, we reported a simple and fast procedure to assemble a circular chloroplast genome using GetOrganelle pipeline.

We conclude that GsrN convenes a post-transcriptional layer of gene expression that serves a central functional role in &lt;i&gt;Caulobacter&lt;/i&gt; stress physiology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16224a41142:304885:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer researchers push to relax rules for clinical trials&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer researchers push to relax rules for clinical trials, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03355-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03355-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;US government examines whether criteria for participating in drug studies unnecessarily exclude some people.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1b66398f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer researchers push to relax rules for clinical trials&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer researchers push to relax rules for clinical trials, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03355-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03355-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;US government examines whether criteria for participating in drug studies unnecessarily exclude some people.</description><crawled>1522784608098</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03355-6</href></item></alternate><engagement>298</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03355-6</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Cancer researchers push to relax rules for clinical trials</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522738800000</published><author><name>Heidi Ledford</name></author><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03355-6</originId><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03355-6/d41586-018-03355-6_15566536.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1628d091f62:95ea4dc:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>Motivation: In most metagenomic sequencing studies, the initial analysis step consists in assessing the evolutionary provenance of the sequences.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) impair the physical and mental status. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive ability of several cardiovascular biomarkers for identifying the incidence of disability as future recipients of public long-term care (LTC) service.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The subjects of this study were community-dwelling elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age without a history of CVD (n = 5,755; mean age, 71 years). The endpoint of this study was official certification as a recipient of LTC. The cohort was divided into quartiles (Qs) based on the levels of three CVD biomarkers: the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), plasma B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (BNP), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (hsCRP). A time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the multi-adjusted relative hazard ratios (HRs) for incident LTC among the quartiles of each biomarker.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the follow-up (mean 5.6 years), 710 subjects were authorized as recipients of LTC. The HR was only significantly increased in the higher Qs of UACR (Q3, p &amp;lt; 0.01; Q4, p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, other biomarkers were not significantly associated with the endpoint. The risk predictive performance for the incidence of LTC as evaluated by an essential model (i.e. age- and sex-adjusted) was significantly improved by incorporating the UACR (net reclassification improvement = 0.084, p &amp;lt; 0.01; integrated discrimination improvement = 0.0018, p &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that an increased UACR is useful for predicting physical and cognitive dysfunction in an elderly general population.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e7c5a7d5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shuko Takahashi, Fumitaka Tanaka, Yuki Yonekura, Kozo Tanno, Masaki Ohsawa, Kiyomi Sakata, Makoto Koshiyama, Akira Okayama, Motoyuki Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

Investigating how recombination might modify gene order during the evolution has become a routine part of mitochondrial genome analysis. A new method of genomic maps analysis based on formal logic is described. The purpose of this method is to 1) use mitochondrial gene order of current taxa as datasets 2) calculate rearrangements between all mitochondrial gene orders and 3) reconstruct phylogenetic relationships according to these calculated rearrangements within a tree under the assumption of maximum parsimony. Unlike existing methods mainly based on the probabilistic approach, the main strength of this new approach is that it calculates all the exact tree solutions with completeness and provides logical consequences as highly robust results. Moreover, this method infers all possible hypothetical ancestors and reconstructs character states for all internal nodes of the trees. We started by testing our method using the deuterostomes as a study case. Then, with sponges as an outgroup, we investigated the evolutionary history of mitochondrial genomes of 47 bilaterian phyla and emphasised the peculiar case of chaetognaths. This pilot work showed that the use of formal logic in a hypothetico-deductive background such as phylogeny (where experimental testing of hypotheses is impossible) is very promising to explore mitochondrial gene order in deuterostomes and should be applied to many other bilaterian clades.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ecf3d70</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurent Oxusoff, Pascal Préa, Yvan Perez&lt;/p&gt;

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry. The larger amplitude significantly increased bone formation (Fractional bone volume: 19.4% vs. 5.2%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; trabecular thickness: 0.1 mm vs. 0.06 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; mean spicule height: 2.6 mm vs. 1.1 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) however, no endochondral ossification occurred. The elimination of shear movement, unimpaired neovascularization as well as the tensile strain stimuli during the distraction phase suppressing chondrogenic differentiation may all contribute to the absence of cartilage. In clinical application of distraction osteogenesis, moderate axial interfragmentary movement augments intramembranous ossification provided shear strain is minimized.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>53f003d2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julian Schuelke, Nicholaus Meyers, Sandra Reitmaier, Svenja Klose, Anita Ignatius, Lutz Claes&lt;/p&gt;

Twenty-two non-selected variables as well as selected ones by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis and by stepwise logistic regression analysis were input into the constructed multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) programs. 232 patients were used as training cases of ANN programs, and the remaining 102 patients were for the test to output the probability of prostate cancer existence, accuracy of prostate cancer prediction, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the learned model. Results; With any prostate cancer objective variable, Lasso and stepwise regression analyses selected 12 and 9 explanatory variables from 22, respectively. In common between them, age at biopsy, findings on digital rectal examination, findings in the peripheral zone on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging, and body mass index were positively influential variables, while numbers of previous prostatic biopsy and prostate volume were negatively influential. Using trained ANNs with multiple hidden layers, the accuracy of predicting any prostate cancer in test samples was about 5-10% higher compared with that with logistic regression analysis (LR). The AUCs with multilayer ANN were significantly larger on inputting variables that were selected by the stepwise logistic regression compared with the AUC with LR. The ANN had a higher net-benefit than LR between prostate cancer probability cut-off values of 0.38 and 0.6. Conclusion; ANN accurately predicted prostate cancer without biopsy marginally better than LR. However, for clinical application, ANN performance may still need improvement.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>74ebef8c</fingerprint><description>Objectives; To predict the rate of prostate cancer detection on prostate biopsy more accurately, the performance of deep learning utilizing a multilayer artificial neural network was investigated.

The authors are going over a number of areas where medicinal chemistry could make use of more advanced synthetic techniques, and they’re good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, “&lt;em&gt;From an industry perspective, the most common challenge for any new synthetic method is its level of tolerance to the polar functional groups and nitrogen heteroatoms found in biologically active molecules.&lt;/em&gt;” Yes indeed. That’s what I look at when I see a neat new transformation in the literature – what did it work on? Basic amines OK? Tertiary or secondary? Secondary amides tolerated? Carboxylic acids? Free OH groups? I’m disappointed sometimes when I find that a reaction can’t tolerate these, but I’m glad that the papers involved at least went to the trouble of finding the limits to their chemistry. Far worse than that is a paper that tiptoes around the issues of chemical compatibility, leaving you to find out for yourself – if you’re so inclined, and often one is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area identified is late-stage functionalization, C-H bond activation, etc. Those reactions are always welcome, for sure. Chemical diversity is one of the names of the game that we play, and anything that allows us to get more of it quickly and reliably is good news. Blending with the above, the more complex and functionalized the molecules that can be used as substrates for such chemistry, the better. We’ll take fluorination, hydroxylation, amination, addition of methoxy, trifluoromethyl, what have you. It’s great to be able to predict where the functionalization will happen, of course, but there’s value in things that just sort of go in and mess with structures, too: new molecules! After all, that’s what the liver enzymes do to our drugs; we’re used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also calls for new ways to synthesize and functionalize small heterocyclic rings, new metal-catalyzed coupling reactions (and new C-C bond-forming reactions in general), more biomolecule-compatible reactions, and more. It also goes briefly into machine-assisted synthesis and software-assisted retrosynthesis, but the bulk of the paper is on synthetic methods, and I can only cheer on their suggestions. These are all potential areas for academic-industrial collaboration to generate new chemistry, because everyone benefits from success in these areas (indeed, some of this collaboration goes on already for just these reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I enjoyed this paper very much, but it starts off with a claim that’s worth arguing about: “&lt;em&gt;organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects&lt;/em&gt;“. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on where you’re standing. All the synthetic limitations described above are real, and they keep us from being able to make a lot of molecules that we’d otherwise be cranking out. But (and this is a big point) it’s rarely the case that we medicinal chemists identify a tricky new structure that absolutely has to be made. That sounds odd, but it comes down to our predictive powers, which aren’t so great. We don’t generally draw some wild compound up on the hood sash and say “That’s the one, folks: find a way to make it or die trying”. We never know which is the one, so in the absence of knowing, we make the things that we can make in the ways that we can make them, and honestly, much of the time, we can manage to come up with something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, though, things like the ability to make more polar compounds reliably and quickly would probably lead to better and more structurally diverse drug candidates and screening compounds, not to mention better starting points for projects in general. We just don’t know which ones. The main examples of specific compounds I can think of are metabolites or potential metabolites, where the liver has made some new polar compound out of an existing drug candidate, and we need to make the new compound(s) for testing. Those can be tough, and sometimes the only way is to grind out small quantities by exposing the drug to liver tissue itself (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for times we can’t come up with something, I would like to believe that far more diverse and interesting sets of compounds, millions of them, would allow for real hits to be found against target classes that we currently have trouble attacking. But that remains to be proven, if it ever can be. Chemical space is so large that you can always say “Well, your compound set still wasn’t big enough – the good ones are still out there”, and there’s no way to say that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the real killers in drug discovery stem from – to put it mildly – our incomplete understanding of biology. It’s Phase II and Phase III failures that hammer us, and those happen because we don’t understand our desirable (and undesirable) mechanisms of action enough, leading to failures in efficacy and safety. Even worse, they come after a big pile of money has been spent. Compared to these problems, generating chemical matter is not as big a concern. We already generate enough chemical matter to send all sorts of stuff into the clinic, where 80 to 90% of it dies for other reasons entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic chemistry is, of course, crucial to making small-molecule drugs, and you’d think that would be enough. But as a chemist, I wish that organic synthesis were more relevant to these deep problems. But in the big picture, it isn’t quite so. Chemical biology, as a field, is an attempt to make that happen, but How to Make will never be able to answer questions of What to Make and Why.&lt;/p&gt;

Drones are being increasingly used in innovative ways to enhance environmental research and conservation. Despite their widespread use for wildlife studies, there are few scientifically justified guidelines that provide minimum distances at which wildlife can be approached to minimize visual and auditory disturbance. These distances are essential to ensure that behavioral and survey data have no observer bias and form the basis of requirements for animal ethics and scientific permit approvals. In the present study, we documented the behaviors of three species of sea turtle (green turtles, &lt;i&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/i&gt;, flatback turtles, &lt;i&gt;Natator depressus&lt;/i&gt;, hawksbill turtles, &lt;i&gt;Eretmochelys imbricata&lt;/i&gt;), saltwater crocodiles (&lt;i&gt;Crocodylus porosus)&lt;/i&gt;, and crested terns (&lt;i&gt;Thalasseus bergii&lt;/i&gt;) in response to a small commercially available (1.4 kg) multirotor drone flown in Northern Territory and Western Australia. Sea turtles in nearshore waters off nesting beaches or in foraging habitats exhibited no evasive behaviors (e.g. rapid diving) in response to the drone at or above 20–30 m altitude, and at or above 10 m altitude for juvenile green and hawksbill turtles foraging on shallow, algae-covered reefs. Adult female flatback sea turtles were not deterred by drones flying forward or stationary at 10 m altitude when crawling up the beach to nest or digging a body pit or egg chamber. In contrast, flyovers elicited a range of behaviors from crocodiles, including minor, lateral head movements, fleeing, or complete submergence when a drone was present below 50 m altitude. Similarly, a colony of crested terns resting on a sand-bank displayed disturbance behaviors (e.g. flight response) when a drone was flown below 60 m altitude. The current study demonstrates a variety of behavioral disturbance thresholds for diverse species and should be considered when establishing operating conditions for drones in behavioral and conservation studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fe047054</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Bevan, Scott Whiting, Tony Tucker, Michael Guinea, Andrew Raith, Ryan Douglas&lt;/p&gt;

In medicine, diagnoses based on medical test results are probabilistic by nature. Unfortunately, cognitive illusions regarding the statistical meaning of test results are well documented among patients, medical students, and even physicians. There are two effective strategies that can foster insight into what is known as Bayesian reasoning situations: (1) translating the statistical information on the prevalence of a disease and the sensitivity and the false-alarm rate of a specific test for that disease from probabilities into natural frequencies, and (2) illustrating the statistical information with tree diagrams, for instance, or with other pictorial representation. So far, such strategies have only been empirically tested in combination for “1-test cases”, where one binary hypothesis (“disease” vs. “no disease”) has to be diagnosed based on one binary test result (“positive” vs. “negative”). However, in reality, often more than one medical test is conducted to derive a diagnosis. In two studies, we examined a total of 388 medical students from the University of Regensburg (Germany) with medical “2-test scenarios”. Each student had to work on two problems: diagnosing breast cancer with mammography and sonography test results, and diagnosing HIV infection with the ELISA and Western Blot tests. In Study 1 (N = 190 participants), we systematically varied the presentation of statistical information (“only textual information” vs. “only tree diagram” vs. “text and tree diagram in combination”), whereas in Study 2 (N = 198 participants), we varied the kinds of tree diagrams (“complete tree” vs. “highlighted tree” vs. “pruned tree”). All versions were implemented in probability format (including probability trees) and in natural frequency format (including frequency trees). We found that natural frequency trees, especially when the question-related branches were highlighted, improved performance, but that none of the corresponding probabilistic visualizations did.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>272c294d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karin Binder, Stefan Krauss, Georg Bruckmaier, Jörg Marienhagen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Dactylis glomerata&lt;/i&gt; L. (orchardgrass) is an important perennial forage species in temperate areas of the world.

Background &lt;p&gt;Circulating melatonin is a good candidate biomarker for studies of circadian rhythms and circadian disruption. However, epidemiologic studies on circulating melatonin are limited because melatonin is secreted at night, yet most epidemiologic studies collect blood during the day when melatonin levels are very low, and assays are lacking that are ultrasensitive to detect low levels of melatonin reliably.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the performance of a refined radioimmunoassay in measuring morning melatonin among women.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used morning serum samples from 47 postmenopausal women ages 48–80 years without a history of breast cancer who participated in the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study, including 19 women who had duplicate measurements. The coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass coefficient (ICC) were estimated using the random effect model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Reproducibility for the assay was satisfactory, with a CV of 11.2% and an ICC of 98.9%; correlation between the replicate samples was also high (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = 0.96). In the 47 women, serum melatonin levels ranged from 0.6 to 62.6 pg/ml, with a median of 7.0 pg/ml.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that it is possible to reliably measure melatonin in postmenopausal women in morning serum samples in large epidemiologic studies to evaluate the role of melatonin in cancer etiology or prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>6979cf83</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lisa W.

The subterranean niche harbours animals with extreme adaptations. These adaptations decrease the vagility of taxa and, along with other behavioural adaptations, often result in isolated populations characterized by small effective population sizes, high inbreeding, population bottlenecks, genetic drift and consequently, high spatial genetic structure. Although information is available for some species, estimates of genetic diversity and whether this variation is spatially structured, is lacking for the Cape mole-rat (&lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt;). By adopting a range-wide sampling regime and employing two variable mitochondrial markers (cytochrome &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; and control region), we report on the effects that life-history, population demography and geographic barriers had in shaping genetic variation and population genetic patterns in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt;. We also compare our results to information available for the sister taxon of the study species, &lt;i&gt;Bathyergus suillus&lt;/i&gt;. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits low genetic diversity relative to the concomitantly distributed &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;suillus&lt;/i&gt;, most likely due to differences in habitat specificity, habitat fragmentation and historical population declines. In addition, the isolated nature of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; populations and low levels of population connectivity has led to small effective population sizes and genetic differentiation, possibly aided by genetic drift. Not surprisingly therefore, &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits pronounced spatial structure across its range in South Africa. Along with geographic distance and demography, other factors shaping the genetic structure of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; include the historical and contemporary impacts of mountains, rivers, sea-level fluctuations and elevation. Given the isolation and differentiation among &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; populations, the monotypic genus &lt;i&gt;Georychus&lt;/i&gt; may represent a species complex.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2f5d5116</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jacobus H.

A few colors, such as red and yellow, are commonly found in aposematic (warning) signaling across taxa, independent of evolutionary relationships. These colors have unique traits (i.e., hue, brightness) that aid in their differentiation, and perhaps, their effectiveness in promoting avoidance learning. This repeated use calls into question the influence of selection on specific warning colors adopted by aposematic prey-predator systems. To disentangle the influence of color characteristics on this process, we trained week-old chickens (&lt;i&gt;Gallus gallus domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) to learn to avoid distasteful food that was associated with one of three color signals (yellow, white, red) that varied in both hue and in brightness in order to assess which of these traits most influenced their ability to learn avoidance. Our results show that while chicks learned to avoid all three colors, avoidance was based on the hue, not brightness of the different signals. We found that yellow was the most effective for avoidance learning, followed by red, and finally white. Our results suggest that while these three colors are commonly used in aposematic signaling, predators’ ability to learn avoidance differs among them. These results may explain why yellow is among the most common signals across aposematic taxa.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>27c86844</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Further, we demonstrate that inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, used in cancer treatment, may increase the diversity of cellular responses, enhancing resistance to treatment.</description><crawled>1523388335706</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/201160v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/201160v2?rss=1</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Origins of fractional control in regulated cell death [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><published>1523343600000</published><author><name>Santos, L.

Chronic constipation is a functional gastrointestinal disease that is detrimental to the quality of patient life. &lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; L. (CO) and &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; M. (FV) are commonly used as medicinal foods in many countries. We aimed to examine the laxative effect and their underlying mechanism of CO and FV mixture on loperamide (lop)-induced constipated rats. To determine the laxative effects of these compounds, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: the control, lop-induced constipated (2mg/kg), and three doses (100, 300, and 500mg/kg) of CO and FV mixture-, and Bisacodyl (bis, 3.3mg/kg)-treated groups. The mixture of CO and FV and bis were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. For induction of constipation, the lop were treated with a dose of 2 mg/kg twice a day on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week after treatments of CO and FV extracts and bis. The results were revealed that the CO and FV mixture has the laxative effects more than those in CO and FV-alone treatments on constipated rats by determining the stool parameters, including stool number and weight. Indeed, stool parameters, such as, stool number, weight, and water contents and colonic peristalsis from the intestinal transit length and ratio were dramatically improved by CO and FV mixture treatment. Histological study also revealed that CO and FV mixture enhanced the thicknesses of mucosa and muscular layers of the colon in constipated rats. For their underlying mechanism, the mRNAs and proteins expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) M2 and M3 and their downstream signaling were preserved by CO and FV mixture treatment in constipated rats. Therefore, this study suggests that treatment with CO and FV mixture has beneficial effects against constipation. We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>302f39ea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Hee Jang, Dong Kwon Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Our present frequently resembles our past. Patterns of actions and events repeat throughout our lives like a motif. Identifying and exploiting these patterns are fundamental to many behaviours, from creating grammar to the application of skill across diverse situations. Such generalization may be dependent upon memory instability. Following their formation, memories are unstable and able to interact with one another, allowing, at least in principle, common features to be extracted. Exploiting these common features creates generalized knowledge that can be applied across varied circumstances.

Globally, the number of dengue cases has been on the increase since 1990 and this trend has also been found in Brazil and its most populated city—São Paulo. Surveillance systems based on predictions allow for timely decision making processes, and in turn, timely and efficient interventions to reduce the burden of the disease. We conducted a comparative study of dengue predictions in São Paulo city to test the performance of trained seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, generalized additive models and artificial neural networks. We also used a naïve model as a benchmark. A generalized additive model with lags of the number of cases and meteorological variables had the best performance, predicted epidemics of unprecedented magnitude and its performance was 3.16 times higher than the benchmark and 1.47 higher that the next best performing model. The predictive models captured the seasonal patterns but differed in their capacity to anticipate large epidemics and all outperformed the benchmark. In addition to be able to predict epidemics of unprecedented magnitude, the best model had computational advantages, since its training and tuning was straightforward and required seconds or at most few minutes. These are desired characteristics to provide timely results for decision makers. However, it should be noted that predictions are made just one month ahead and this is a limitation that future studies could try to reduce.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3294b76</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Oswaldo Santos Baquero, Lidia Maria Reis Santana, Francisco Chiaravalloti-Neto&lt;/p&gt;
Globally, the number of dengue cases has been on the increase since 1990 and this trend has also been found in Brazil and its most populated city—São Paulo. Surveillance systems based on predictions allow for timely decision making processes, and in turn, timely and efficient interventions to reduce the burden of the disease. We conducted a comparative study of dengue predictions in São Paulo city to test the performance of trained seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, generalized additive models and artificial neural networks. We also used a naïve model as a benchmark. A generalized additive model with lags of the number of cases and meteorological variables had the best performance, predicted epidemics of unprecedented magnitude and its performance was 3.16 times higher than the benchmark and 1.47 higher that the next best performing model. The predictive models captured the seasonal patterns but differed in their capacity to anticipate large epidemics and all outperformed the benchmark. In addition to be able to predict epidemics of unprecedented magnitude, the best model had computational advantages, since its training and tuning was straightforward and required seconds or at most few minutes. These are desired characteristics to provide timely results for decision makers. However, it should be noted that predictions are made just one month ahead and this is a limitation that future studies could try to reduce.</description><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195065</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195065</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Dengue forecasting in São Paulo city with generalized additive models, artificial neural networks and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><published>1522702800000</published><author><name>Oswaldo Santos Baquero</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195065</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195065</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7691f:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23819-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23819-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/bylwsAoqO_4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4cf58ae0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23819-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23819-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/bylwsAoqO_4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1522747164176</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/bylwsAoqO_4/s41598-018-23819-z</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23819-z</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Attentional advantages in video-game experts are not related to perceptual tendencies</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522738800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23819-z</href></item></canonical><author><name>Nicole H.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical significance of the laboratory-based phenomenon of clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness and platelet reactivity associated with acute myocardial infarction, despite chronic clopidogrel therapy, is largely unknown. We aimed to determine platelet reactivity and clinical and angiographic features in 29 consecutive patients sustaining an acute myocardial infarction despite chronic (≥1 month) clopidogrel therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Platelet reactivity was determined on admission using conventional aggregometry. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 24 hours of admission. Patients were matched with clopidogrel-naïve acute myocardial infarction patients. Clopidogrel-naïve patients received a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose and 75 mg/day thereafter.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 29 study patients, 19 (66%) presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and in 25% the infarction was related to angiographically-proved definite stent thrombosis. Two-thirds of these patients were poor responders to clopidogrel (adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation &gt;50%) and dual antiplatelet poor responsiveness was found in 57% in the chronic clopidogrel therapy group.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity after acute coronary syndrome compared to patients without prior multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multicenter prospective cohort study in Switzerland included 5,635 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome between 2009 and 2014, with a one-year follow-up period. We defined cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity as having at least two prior comorbidities before the index hospitalization. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional models were built to assess the one-year risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, defined as cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke. The final model was adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, tobacco consumption, education, and family history of cardiovascular disease, prescription of high-dose statinsat discharge and use of cardiac rehabilitation after discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 3,664 patients (65%) had no multimorbidity, 1,839 (33%) had cardiovascular multimorbidity, 62 (1%) had non-cardiovascular multimorbidity, and 70 (1%) had both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity. The multivariate risk of recurrent cardiovascular events was increased among patients with cardiovascular multimorbidity (hazard ratio (HR) 2.05, 95% CI: 1.54–2.73, p&amp;lt;0.001) and patients with non-cardiovascular multimorbidity (HR 2.57, 95% CI: 1.04–6.35, p = 0.04) compared to patients without multimorbidity. Patients with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular multimorbidity had the highest risk of recurrence with a HR of 5.19, 95% CI: 2.79–9.64, p&amp;lt;0.001, compared to patients without multimorbidity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity increased by two-fold the risk of cardiovascular events over the year after an acute coronary syndrome.

We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErL2lgBM7O0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurent Dollé, Ricardo Chavarriaga, Agnès Guillot, Mehdi Khamassi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;African Americans are disproportionately affected by both HIV and hypertension. Failure to modify risk factors for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease such as hypertension among HIV-infected patients may attenuate the benefits conferred by combination antiretroviral therapy. In the general population, African Americans with hypertension are less likely to have controlled blood pressure than whites. However, racial differences in blood pressure control among HIV-infected patients are not well studied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study evaluating racial differences in hypertension prevalence, treatment, and control among 1,664 patients attending the University of Alabama at Birmingham HIV Clinic in 2013. Multivariable analyses were performed to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measure of association between race and hypertension prevalence and control while adjusting for other covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean age of patients was 47 years, 77% were male and 54% African-American. The prevalence of hypertension was higher among African Americans compared with whites (49% vs. 43%; p = 0.02). Among those with hypertension, 91% of African Americans and 93% of whites were treated (p = 0.43). Among those treated, 50% of African Americans versus 60% of whites had controlled blood pressure (systolic blood pressure &amp;lt;140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &amp;lt;90 mmHg) (p = 0.007). After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, prevalence of hypertension was higher among African Americans compared to whites (PR 1.25; 95% CI 1.12–1.39) and prevalence of BP control was lower (PR 0.80; 95% CI 0.69–0.93).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Despite comparable levels of hypertension treatment, African Americans in our HIV cohort were less likely to achieve blood pressure control. This may place them at increased risk for adverse outcomes that disproportionately impact HIV-infected patients, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, and thus attenuate the benefits conferred by combination antiretroviral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>27d56c6d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Greer A.

Athletes then performed a 12-session resisted (10 × 20-m; and pre- post-profiling) sprint training intervention following the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; training protocols had minor effects on sprinting performance (average of -1.4 to -2.3% split-times respectively), and provided trivial, small and unclear changes in mechanical sprinting parameters.

Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has devastated the cattle industry in Sri Lanka many times in the past. Despite its seriousness, limited attempts have been made to understand the disease to ameliorate its effects–current recommendation for vaccines being based solely on immunological assessments rather than on molecular identification. The general belief is that the cattle population in Sri Lanka acquired the FMD virus (FMDV) strains via introductions from India. However, there could be endemic FMDV lineages circulating in Sri Lanka. To infer the phylogenetic relationships of the FMDV strains in the island, we sequenced the VP1 genomic region of the virus isolates collected during the 2014 outbreak together with a few reported cases in 2012 and 1997 and compared them to VP1 sequences from South Asia. The FMDV strains collected in the 2014 outbreak belonged to the lineage, Ind-2001d, of the topotype, ME-SA. The strains collected in 2012 and 1997 belonged to another lineage called &apos;unnamed&apos; by the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease (WRLFMD). Based on the present analysis, we designate the lineage &apos;unnamed&apos; as Srl-97 which we found endemic to Sri Lanka. The evolutionary rates of Srl-97 and Ind-2001d in Sri Lanka were estimated to be 0.0004 and 0.0046 substitutions/site/year, respectively, suggesting that Srl-97 evolves slowly.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>601ed344</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by S.

The evolutionary rates of Srl-97 and Ind-2001d in Sri Lanka were estimated to be 0.0004 and 0.0046 substitutions/site/year, respectively, suggesting that Srl-97 evolves slowly.</description><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194077</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194077</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>The phylogenetic analysis of VP1 genomic region in foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype O isolates in Sri Lanka reveals the existence of &apos;Srl-97&apos;, a newly named endemic lineage</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><published>1521838800000</published><author><name>S.

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. On high-resolution manometry (HRM), impaired LES relaxation is defined by elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP). However, a new category of achalasia within the normal IRP range has been suggested.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;HRM was performed using a Starlet device and an IRP threshold of 26 mmHg. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) was performed for cases of achalasia diagnosed using established methods. During POEM, the histology of the LES was assessed. Follow-up was performed 2 months post-operatively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients with achalasia (18 women, mean age 53 ± 18.6 years) were included. Among them, 27 were placed in the IRP &gt; 26 mmHg subgroup (impaired LES relaxation on HRM) and 14 in the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup (normal LES relaxation on HRM). In the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup, patients were older, had longer symptom duration, and had more esophageal dilation. The IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup had the same symptom severity as the higher IRP subgroup and POEM significantly improved symptoms and IRP, although four patients still had severe LES fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The clinical presentation of achalasia has a gap between a HRM-defined impaired LES relaxation, with aging or disease progression considered reasons for a lowered LES pressure. POEM can be a feasible treatment option, even for cases of achalasia with a normal IRP. However, patients with severe LES fibrosis need more attention for the therapeutic indication.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a5b0a478</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hiroki Sato, Kazuya Takahashi, Ken-ichi Mizuno, Satoru Hashimoto, Junji Yokoyama, Shuji Terai&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;This study explored spatial-temporal variation in diagnoses of gonorrhoea to identify and quantify endemic areas and clusters in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes of partner notification (PN) across England, UK.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Endemic areas and clusters were identified using a two-stage analysis with Kulldorff’s scan statistics (SaTScan).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2,571,838 tests, 53,547 diagnoses were gonorrhoea positive (positivity = 2.08%). The proportion of diagnoses in heterosexual males was 1.5 times that in heterosexual females. Among index cases, men who have sex with men (MSM) were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhoea than heterosexual males (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and deprivation rank, 4 endemic areas were identified including 11,047 diagnoses, 86% of which occurred in London. 33 clusters included 17,629 diagnoses (34% of total diagnoses in 2012 and 2013) and spanned 21 locations, some of which were dominated by heterosexually acquired infection, whilst others were MSM focused. Of the 53,547 diagnoses, 14.5% (7,775) were the result of PN. The proportion of patients who attended services as a result of PN varied from 0% to 61% within different age, gender and sexual orientation cohorts. A third of tests resulting from PN were positive for gonorrhoea. 25% of Local Authorities (n = 81, 95% CI: 20.2, 29.5) had a higher than expected proportion for female PN diagnoses as compared to 16% for males (n = 52, 95% CI: 12.0, 19.9).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The English gonorrhoea epidemic is characterised by spatial-temporal variation. PN success varied between endemic areas and clusters. Greater emphasis should be placed on the role of PN in the control of gonorrhoea to reduce the risk of onward transmission, re-infection, and complications of infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>86d9427a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allen O’Brien, Ellie Sherrard-Smith, Bersabeh Sile, Charlotte Watts, Ian Simms&lt;/p&gt;

Polyploidization has played an important role in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly at the base of Teleostei–an enormously successful ray-finned fish group with additional genome doublings on lower taxonomic levels. The investigation of post-polyploid genome dynamics might provide important clues about the evolution and ecology of respective species and can help to decipher the role of polyploidy &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on speciation. Few studies have attempted to investigate the dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences in the post-polyploid genome using molecular cytogenetic tools in fishes, though recent efforts demonstrated their usefulness. The demonstrably monophyletic freshwater loach family Botiidae, branching to evolutionary diploid and tetraploid lineages separated &gt;25 Mya, offers a suited model group for comparing the long-term repetitive DNA evolution. For this, we integrated phylogenetic analyses with cytogenetical survey involving Giemsa- and Chromomycin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/DAPI stainings and fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization with 5S/45S rDNA, U2 snDNA and telomeric probes in representative sample of 12 botiid species.
The karyotypes of all diploids were composed of 2n = 50 chromosomes, while majority of tetraploids had 2n = 4x = 100, with only subtle interspecific karyotype differences. The exceptional karyotype of &lt;i&gt;Botia dario&lt;/i&gt; (2n = 4x = 96) suggested centric fusions behind the 2n reduction. Variable patterns of FISH signals revealed cases of intraspecific polymorphisms, rDNA amplification, variable degree of correspondence with CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and almost no phylogenetic signal. In tetraploids, either additivity or loci gain/loss was recorded. Despite absence of classical interstitial telomeric sites, large blocks of interspersed rDNA/telomeric regions were found in diploids only.
We uncovered different molecular drives of studied repetitive DNA classes within botiid genomes as well as the advanced stage of the re-diploidization process in tetraploids. Our results may contribute to link genomic approach with molecular cytogenetic analyses in addressing the origin and mechanism of this polyploidization event.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b6e8f653</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandr Sember, Jörg Bohlen, Vendula Šlechtová, Marie Altmanová, Šárka Pelikánová, Petr Ráb&lt;/p&gt;

The microtubule associated protein tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that tau also plays a role in disorders of neuronal connectivity, including epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Animal studies have shown that the MAPT gene, which codes for the tau protein, undergoes complex pre-mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms during brain development. Human data, particularly on temporal and regional variation in tau splicing during development are however lacking. In this study, we present the first detailed examination of the temporal and regional sequence of MAPT alternative splicing in the developing human brain. We used a novel computational analysis of large transcriptomic datasets (total n = 502 patients), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting to examine tau expression and splicing in post-mortem human fetal, pediatric and adult brains. We found that MAPT exons 2 and 10 undergo abrupt shifts in expression during the perinatal period that are unique in the canonical human microtubule-associated protein family, while exon 3 showed small but significant temporal variation. Tau isoform expression may be a marker of neuronal maturation, temporally correlated with the onset of axonal growth. Immature brain regions such as the ganglionic eminence and rhombic lip had very low tau expression, but within more mature regions, there was little variation in tau expression or splicing. We thus demonstrate an abrupt, evolutionarily conserved shift in tau isoform expression during the human perinatal period that may be due to tau expression in maturing neurons. Alternative splicing of the &lt;i&gt;MAPT&lt;/i&gt; pre-mRNA may play a vital role in normal brain development across multiple species and provides a basis for future investigations into the developmental and pathological functions of the tau protein.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a123f70e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marco M.

Alternative splicing of the &lt;i&gt;MAPT&lt;/i&gt; pre-mRNA may play a vital role in normal brain development across multiple species and provides a basis for future investigations into the developmental and pathological functions of the tau protein.</description><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195771</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195771</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>High-resolution temporal and regional mapping of &amp;lt;i&gt;MAPT&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression and splicing in human brain development</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><published>1523394000000</published><author><name>Marco M.

The ABCG2 multidrug transporter provides resistance against various endo- and xenobiotics, and protects the stem cells against toxins and stress conditions. We have shown earlier that a GFP-tagged version of ABCG2 is fully functional and may be used to follow the expression, localization and function of this transporter in living cells. In the present work we have overexpressed GFP-ABCG2, driven by a constitutive (CAG) promoter, in HUES9 human embryonic stem cells. Stem cell clones were generated to express the wild-type and a substrate-mutant (R482G) GFP-ABCG2 variant, by using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. We found that the stable overexpression of these transgenes did not change the pluripotency and growth properties of the stem cells, nor their differentiation capacity to hepatocytes or cardiomyocytes. ABCG2 overexpression provided increased toxin resistance in the stem cells, and protected the derived cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin toxicity. These studies document the potential of a stable ABCG2 expression for engineering toxin-resistant human pluripotent stem cells and selected stem cell derived tissues.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ad7fb478</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zsuzsa Erdei, Anita Schamberger, György Török, Kornélia Szebényi, György Várady, Tamás I.

A sensitive and innovative assay system based on a micro-MEMS-fluxgate sensor and immunomagnetic beads-labels was developed for the rapid analysis of C-reactive proteins (CRP). The fluxgate sensor presented in this study was fabricated through standard micro-electro-mechanical system technology. A multi-loop magnetic core made of Fe-based amorphous ribbon was employed as the sensing element, and 3-D solenoid copper coils were used to control the sensing core. Antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic microbeads were strategically utilized as signal tags to label the CRP via the specific conjugation of CRP to polyclonal CRP antibodies. Separate Au film substrates were applied as immunoplatforms to immobilize CRP-beads labels through classical sandwich assays. Detection and quantification of the CRP at different concentrations were implemented by detecting the stray field of CRP labeled magnetic beads using the newly-developed micro-fluxgate sensor. The resulting system exhibited the required sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. A detection limit as low as 0.002 μg/mL CRP with a linearity range from 0.002 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL was achieved, and this suggested that the proposed biosystem possesses high sensitivity. In addition to the extremely low detection limit, the proposed method can be easily manipulated and possesses a quick response time. The response time of our sensor was less than 5 s, and the entire detection period for CRP analysis can be completed in less than 30 min using the current method. Given the detection performance and other advantages such as miniaturization, excellent stability and specificity, the proposed biosensor can be considered as a potential candidate for the rapid analysis of CRP, especially for point-of-care platforms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f78ae144</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lei Guo, Zhen Yang, Shaotao Zhi, Zhu Feng, Chong Lei, Yong Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

There has been an increasing realisation that young infants are exposed to elevated concentrations of the carcinogen inorganic arsenic, relative to adults. This is because many infant food products are rice based, and rice is ~10-fold elevated in inorganic arsenic compared to most other foods. The European Commission (EC) has acted on this concern setting stricter standards for infants, 100 μg of inorganic arsenic per kg of food (100 μg/kg), as compared to adults (200 μg/kg), for rice based foods, a law that was brought into place in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2016. Here we investigate how this law has impacted on inorganic arsenic in baby food products in the UK market, and compare the findings to previous baby food surveys taken before and just after the law came into place. We find that for a wide range of UK infant products that the new regulations are being adhered to, with all samples surveyed, being under 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic. The prevalence of pure rice products had decreased in the UK, and there appears to be careful sourcing of the rice used in these products to ensure conformity with regulations. There has been an increased presence of mixed cereal products, with rice and maize as the main ingredient, appearing on the UK market, with varying rice contents for infant porridges, cakes and mueslis, with the latter being a relatively innovative product for infant foods. There was a highly significant correlation (P&amp;lt;0.0001) between rice content and inorganic arsenic concentration across all infant foods. When UK infant rice cakes, breakfast cereals and porridges were compare to their general, i.e. not labelled specifically for being for infant consumption, equivalent it was found that the adult foods generally exceeded the 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic standard for infant foods. Thus, infants should not be given rice products not specifically labelled as being for them if a lower inorganic arsenic diet is to be maintained.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>749d790c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Manus Carey, Emily Donaldson, Antonio J.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes progressive disability in 1 of every 5,000 boys due to the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Despite much advancement in knowledge about DMD disease presentation and progression—attributable in part to studies using mouse and canine models of the disease–current DMD treatments are not equally effective in all patients. There remains, therefore, a need for translational animal models in which novel treatment targets can be identified and evaluated. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of DMD. As with DMD, speed of disease progression in GRMD varies substantially. However, unlike DMD, all GRMD dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the GRMD dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 GRMD dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which GRMD stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with DMD and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of GRMD as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) in faster-progressing GRMD dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in GRMD and DMD. In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>816dcdf7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford, Candice Chu, Cynthia Balog-Alvarez, Xue Yu, James J.

Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of DMD. As with DMD, speed of disease progression in GRMD varies substantially. However, unlike DMD, all GRMD dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the GRMD dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 GRMD dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which GRMD stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with DMD and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of GRMD as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) in faster-progressing GRMD dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in GRMD and DMD. In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research.</description><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Expression profiling of disease progression in canine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><published>1521493200000</published><author><name>Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fd:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><fingerprint>36258be</fingerprint><keywords><item>Anthropology, Evolution</item></keywords><crawled>1521143966531</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1200?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>320</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1200?rss=1</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Complex behavior arose at dawn of humans</title><unread>False</unread><published>1521135592000</published><author><name>Gibbons, A.</name></author><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/1200.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1200?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d2514c:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Huang and Xu argue that the &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ion in (N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl we described in our report is theoretically unfavorable and is instead protonated.

Although various mathematical models of this oscillating system exist, it is not clear how to best model the required time delay.

We implement the time delay in three qualitatively different ways, using a fixed time delay, a distribution of time delays, and a delay that is state-dependent. We analyze the dynamics in all cases, and we use experimental observations to interpret our results and put constraints on unknown parameters.

The existing protein complex detection methods can be broadly divided into two categories: unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Most of the unsupervised learning methods assume that protein complexes are in dense regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks even though many true complexes are not dense subgraphs. Supervised learning methods utilize the informative properties of known complexes; they often extract features from existing complexes and then use the features to train a classification model. The trained model is used to guide the search process for new complexes. However, insufficient extracted features, noise in the PPI data and the incompleteness of complex data make the classification model imprecise. Consequently, the classification model is not sufficient for guiding the detection of complexes. Therefore, we propose a new robust score function that combines the classification model with local structural information. Based on the score function, we provide a search method that works both forwards and backwards. The results from experiments on six benchmark PPI datasets and three protein complex datasets show that our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for protein complex detection, occasionally significantly outperforming such methods.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>608c2992</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yadong Dong, Yongqi Sun, Chao Qin&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, prevalence and incidence of induced abortion was estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study enrolling women aged 18–25 years from maternal health centers in Southern Lima, Peru, was conducted. Induced abortion was defined as the difference between the total number of pregnancies ended in abortion and the number of spontaneous abortions; whereas perceived social support was assessed using the DUKE-UNC scale. Prevalence and incidence of induced abortion (per 100 person-years risk) was estimated, and the association of interest was evaluated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. A total of 298 women were enrolled, mean age 21.7 (± 2.2) years. Low levels of social support were found in 43.6% (95%CI 38.0%–49.3%), and 17.4% (95%CI: 13.1%– 21.8%) women reported at least one induced abortion. The incidence of induced abortion was 2.37 (95%CI: 1.81–3.11) per 100 person-years risk. The multivariable model showed evidence of the association between low perceived social support and induced abortion (RR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.14–3.30) after controlling for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was evidence of an association between low perceived social support and induced abortion among women aged 18 to 25 years.

Our previous research demonstrated that tilianin protects the myocardium in a myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) rat model and has prominent pharmacological potential as a cardiovascular drug. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular signaling implicated in the improvement of myocardial survival induced by tilianin, a flavonoid antioxidant. Tilianin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/d) or saline was orally administered to rats for 14 days. On the 15th day, ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 45 min, followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The levels of MIRI-induced serum myocardial enzymes and cardiomyocyte apoptosis as well as infarct size were examined to assess the cardioprotective effects. Cardiac tissues were collected for western blot analyses to determine the protein expression of anti-apoptotic signaling molecules. In MIRI-treated rats, our results revealed that pre-administration of high dose-tilianin the reduced release of LDH, MDA, and CK-MB and increased the plasma SOD level, and significantly attenuated the infarct size. Western blot analysis showed that a remarkable rise in expression of Bcl-2 and XIAP, and decline in expression of Bax, Smac/Diablo, HtrA2/Omi, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 was observed in the myocardium. The apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes further supports the cardioprotective effect of tilianin. Additionally, compared with the MIRI model group, pretreatment with high dose-tilianin group upregulated phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In contrast, using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block Akt activation effectively inhibited the protective effects of tilianin against MIRI. Tilianin pretreatment was beneficial for activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting myocardial apoptosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b672c86a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng Zeng, Wen Jiang, Ruifang Zheng, Chenghui He, Jianguang Li, Jianguo Xing&lt;/p&gt;

In MIRI-treated rats, our results revealed that pre-administration of high dose-tilianin the reduced release of LDH, MDA, and CK-MB and increased the plasma SOD level, and significantly attenuated the infarct size. Western blot analysis showed that a remarkable rise in expression of Bcl-2 and XIAP, and decline in expression of Bax, Smac/Diablo, HtrA2/Omi, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 was observed in the myocardium. The apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes further supports the cardioprotective effect of tilianin. Additionally, compared with the MIRI model group, pretreatment with high dose-tilianin group upregulated phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In contrast, using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block Akt activation effectively inhibited the protective effects of tilianin against MIRI. Tilianin pretreatment was beneficial for activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting myocardial apoptosis.</description><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193845</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193845</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Cardioprotection of tilianin ameliorates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury: Role of the apoptotic signaling pathway</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><published>1521061200000</published><author><name>Cheng Zeng</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193845</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193845</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9fa:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Base editing with a Cpf1–cytidine deaminase fusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Base editing with a Cpf1–cytidine deaminase fusion, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4102&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4102&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A new fusion protein enables precise editing of single bases in A/T-rich regions of the human genome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8d0dcb03</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Base editing with a Cpf1–cytidine deaminase fusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Base editing with a Cpf1–cytidine deaminase fusion, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4102&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4102&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A new fusion protein enables precise editing of single bases in A/T-rich regions of the human genome.</description><crawled>1521472078673</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4102</href></item></alternate><engagement>8</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4102</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Base editing with a Cpf1–cytidine deaminase fusion</title><unread>True</unread><published>1521442800000</published><author><name>Xiaosa Li</name></author><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4102</originId><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nbt.4102-F1.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><width>546</width></visual><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_1623ecd8351:26fb6ba:34f43e70</id></item><item><fingerprint>a7bffc57</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00191/20180404/images/medium/ct-2018-00191m_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00191&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most prevalent congenital infection acquired worldwide, with higher incidence in developing countries and among HIV-exposed children. Less is known regarding vertical transmission of parvovirus B19 (B19V) and enterovirus (EV). We aimed to assess the prevalence of CMV, B19V and EV vertical transmission and compare results of screening of congenital CMV obtained from two different specimens in a semirural Mozambican maternity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant mothers attending Manhiça District Hospital upon delivery. Information on maternal risk factors was ascertained. Dried umbilical cord (DUC) samples were collected in filter paper for CMV, B19V and EV detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) to test for CMV by RT-PCR. Maternal blood samples and placental biopsy samples were also obtained to investigate CMV maternal serology, HIV status and immunopathology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From September 2014 to January 2015, 118 mothers/newborn pairs were recruited. Prevalence of maternal HIV infection was 31.4% (37/118). CMV RT-PCR was positive in 3/115 (2.6%) of DUC samples and in 3/96 (6.3%) of NPA samples obtained from neonates. The concordance of the RT-PCR assay through DUC with their correspondent NPA sample was moderate (Kappa = 0.42 and p&amp;lt;0.001. No differences on cCMV prevalence were found among HIV-exposed and unexposed. All (100%) mothers were seropositive for CMV IgG. RT-PCR of EV and B19V in DUC were both negative in all screened cases. No histological specific findings were found in placental tissues. No risk factors associated to vertical transmission of these viral infections were found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study indicates the significant occurrence of vertical transmission of CMV in southern Mozambique. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the true burden, clinical relevance and consequences of congenital infections with such pathogens in resource-constrained settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>90763807</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lola Madrid, Rosauro Varo, Sonia Maculuve, Tacilta Nhampossa, Carmen Muñoz-Almagro, Enrique J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Inequalities in health among groups of various socio-economic status (as measured by education, occupation, and income) constitute one of the main challenges for public health. Since 2006, the Lazio Regional Outcome Evaluation Program (P.Re.Val.E.), presents a set of indicators of hospital performance based on quality standards driven by strong clinical recommendations, and measures the variation in the access to effective health care for different population groups and providers in the Lazio Region. One of the aims of the program was to compare population subgroups in order to promote equity in service provision. Since June 2013, a new management strategy has been put in place that assigned specific goals based on performance assessment to the chief executive officers of the hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether, in recent years, there has been a reduction in the differential access to effective health care, among individuals with different educational levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We enrolled all patients discharged from both public and private hospitals of the Lazio region between 2012 and 2015, living in Lazio region. We analysed the proportion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes (primary PCI), the proportion of patients with hip fracture (HF) who underwent surgery within 2 days, and the proportion of women with primary C-section. We applied multivariate logistic regression models to assess the effect of educational level on health outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities that could affect the outcomes. For each year of the study period, we compared adjusted proportions of outcomes for the highest and the lowest level of education by using percentage differences.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, 44.6% of STEMI patients (N = 3,299) were treated with primary PCI, 54.4% of patients with hip fractures (N = 6,602) underwent surgery within 2 days, and 27.7% of women without a previous C-section (N = 34,718) delivered via C-section, in 2015. The corresponding proportions in 2012 were 27.8%, 31.3% and 31.5%, respectively. By comparing the adjusted proportions in patients with the highest education level (a university degree or higher) to those with the lowest level education level (None/Primary school), a decrease in the percentage difference was observed during the study period. In STEMI and delivery cohorts, the improvement of outcomes involved the least and the most educated patients, respectively, and the difference between the two educational levels was close to zero in 2015, whereas for hip patients, the improvement was more evident among the less educated patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, we observed a reduction in the differential access to effective heath care by educational level, in different clinical areas. Different factors might explain these results. On top of the public disclosure of outcome data, the management strategy applied in mid-2013 might have driven the overall improvement of the health system for the considered conditions, helping to achieve a fairer access to health.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bf9aff61</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Ventura, Danilo Fusco, Katia Bontempi, Paola Colais, Marina Davoli&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Pro-active case detection (Pro-ACD), in the form of voluntary screening and treatment (VSAT) following community mobilisation about ‘asymptomatic malaria’, is currently being evaluated as a tool for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; elimination in Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted to explore community understanding, perceptions, expectations and acceptability of the Pro-ACD intervention in order to identify aspects that could be improved in future Pro-ACD activities. This was ancillary to a three-round VSAT campaign, carried out in three villages between December 2015 and March 2016. Qualitative data collection began shortly after the end of the three rounds of screening. Purposive sampling was used to select participants. Nine focus group discussions with participants (n = 46) and non-participants (n = 40) in the Pro-ACD screening were conducted, in addition to in-depth interviews with key village figures (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Health promotion messages were well delivered and received, but it was difficult for many villagers to understand the messages around ‘asymptomatic malaria’. Overall, villagers and village leaders had a positive opinion about the VSAT intervention. Acceptability was high, as a direct consequence of favourable perceptions towards the screening activity: the Pro-ACD intervention was seen by the local population as an effective, inexpensive, reliable and readily available tool to protect individuals and the community from the insurgence of malaria. Physical absence and lack of time (both linked to work-related activities) were the main reasons for non-participation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although VSAT was generally well perceived and accepted, the ‘time factor’ related to the need to satisfy essential daily subsistence requirements played a significant role in determining participation in the screening. More well-adapted and meaningful Pro-ACD approaches could be implemented by improving the timing of the testing activites, and strengthening community participation and engagement to increase acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>89db08b6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pierluigi Taffon, Gabriele Rossi, Jean-Marie Kindermans, Rafael Van den Bergh, Chea Nguon, Mark Debackere, Lieven Vernaeve, Martin De Smet, Emilie Venables&lt;/p&gt;

Nine focus group discussions with participants (n = 46) and non-participants (n = 40) in the Pro-ACD screening were conducted, in addition to in-depth interviews with key village figures (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Health promotion messages were well delivered and received, but it was difficult for many villagers to understand the messages around ‘asymptomatic malaria’. Overall, villagers and village leaders had a positive opinion about the VSAT intervention. Acceptability was high, as a direct consequence of favourable perceptions towards the screening activity: the Pro-ACD intervention was seen by the local population as an effective, inexpensive, reliable and readily available tool to protect individuals and the community from the insurgence of malaria. Physical absence and lack of time (both linked to work-related activities) were the main reasons for non-participation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although VSAT was generally well perceived and accepted, the ‘time factor’ related to the need to satisfy essential daily subsistence requirements played a significant role in determining participation in the screening. More well-adapted and meaningful Pro-ACD approaches could be implemented by improving the timing of the testing activites, and strengthening community participation and engagement to increase acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195809</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195809</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>‘I could not join because I had to work for pay.’: A qualitative evaluation of &amp;lt;i&gt;falciparum&amp;lt;/i&gt;

In 2013, a large measles epidemic occurred in the Aketi Health Zone of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We conducted a two-stage, retrospective cluster survey to estimate the attack rate, the case fatality rate, and the measles-specific mortality rate during the epidemic. 1424 households containing 7880 individuals were included. The estimated attack rate was 14.0%, (35.0% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). The estimated case fatality rate was 4.2% (6.1% among children aged &amp;lt;5years). Spatial analysis and linear regression showed that younger children, those who did not receive care, and those living farther away from Aketi Hospital early in the epidemic had a higher risk of measles related death. Vaccination coverage prior to the outbreak was low (76%), and a delayed reactive vaccination campaign contributed to the high attack rate. We provide evidences suggesting that a comprehensive case management approach reduced measles fatality during this epidemic in rural, inaccessible resource-poor setting.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>6935a1f8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Etienne Gignoux, Jonathan Polonsky, Iza Ciglenecki, Mathieu Bichet, Matthew Coldiron, Enoch Thuambe Lwiyo, Innocent Akonda, Micaela Serafini, Klaudia Porten&lt;/p&gt;

This should surprise no one at all, but it’s good to have some quantitative data on the problem. There are limitations to the study – for one thing, it’s quite possible that (self-selected) respondents were among those more likely to have experienced these problems. The survey was done across 26 different countries (over 2200 respondents), 70% female/28% male/2% transgender, and the fields of study involved were 56% humanities and 38% physical sciences – no breakdown of the numbers by these categories is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these reservations, I have no trouble believing the overall conclusions – based on my own experience and my observations since, I think that anxiety and depression are &lt;em&gt;very close to inevitable&lt;/em&gt; in graduate study, and that students should be aware of what they’re getting into. What’s happening, in any field, is the rubber finally meeting the road: you’re not just sitting in classrooms; you’re doing what practitioners of your chosen line of work actually do, and you’re finding out what that’s really like and whether or not you’re any good at it. If that doesn’t bring on the occasional bout of anxiety and self-doubt, then something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from that to depression is not such a huge jump, either. All of us who have been through grad school have seen people who sort of freeze up at some point in their progress. Sometimes it happens near the beginning, such as when chemistry graduate students move out of classes and into the labs – some of them just can’t seem to get anything going. I remember people who were always just about to start something, just about to figure out what went wrong with the last thing (which was spread out into a bunch of inconclusive samples around their hoods), just about to really start making some progress. But they never did. Later in the process, another familiar figure is the person who’s been hanging around for years in the lab, running ever more experiments to avoid writing up, as is their near-relative, the person who’s actually out of the lab, writing up that dissertation/thesis, expected to set a defense date pretty soon. . .and who in the end, is never heard from again after a while, finding themselves unable to get the thing done. After a while, the official notices from the department come back stamped “Addressee unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression might well be a good description of what’s going on in many of these situations. Someone finds themselves in an untenable situation and sinks into a state that makes it more untenable every day. David Foster Wallace defined a harmful addiction as something that offered itself as the remedy for the problems that it itself was causing (as with alcohol), and the downward-spiral mode of life has some similarities, as a big factor in what put you into this spot makes you ever less likely to do anything about it. The canonical view of major depression from the inside is William Styron’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pFf7lZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but you don’t have to be as far along as Styron was to be in real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I got quite as far as depression myself, but there’s no doubt that I was under significant stress. Even the stock of stories that I have from grad school illustrates that. So many of them feature me losing my temper about something, and honestly, I rarely do that out here in the real world. I well recall unnerving bouts of fear and uncertainty, wondering if I was doing the right thing with my life, wondering if it was too late to do much about that even if I were, wondering if my research was any good or if I was any good at doing it, and what I was going to do about it if the answer to either or both of those were actually “No”. And so on. By the end of it, I was thoroughly sick of my project, wildly ready to get out the door and see what the post-doc life was going to be like (and very much wondering if it would turn out to be more of the same, in a different location).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw some outright breakdowns while I was in grad school – there’s no other way to describe them. In some cases a person’s hours and behavior would become erratic, their actions hard to understand or predict. Sometimes in these the ship would apparently right itself and sometimes it wouldn’t. I saw examples of just those situations mentioned above, with people unable to make a real start in research or unable to write up at the end of it. And there was one flat-out suicide attempt, very nearly successful and permanently damaging to the person involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my own worst moments, I would be standing there in the lab feeling like a pitcher out on the mound who had just shaken off every pitch he knew how to throw. I was hauling material up the mountainside of a long linear synthesis, and I was frustrated to a degree beyond anything I’d ever experienced. I didn’t feel like working up the reactions in front of me, and I didn’t feel like setting up others. Waiting for me was my reward at the end of twenty-odd linear steps, the chance to risk all my hard work by trying (finally) some new chemistry that would probably not work and might well destroy my starting material in the process. Oh joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve told this next story before, but can’t track down the post where I did. At any rate, a pivotal moment was when I was bashing along with the largest load of starting material I’d ever made. Up at around step 9 (I was still in liter-sized flask territory) I was ready to work up the whole batch after a late-night reaction. I added some ammonium chloride and extracted the black mixture. That didn’t worry me; it was always black. I evaporated it down to a bunch of black oil and loaded it on a big gravity column of coarse silica gel – from prior runs, I knew that would hold the black crud at the top and allow a big yellow band of product to elute. Except this time the whole column turned black. Must have overloaded the column with this big pile of material, I thought. I collected a bunch of black fractions and rota-vapped them down, only to find what I sort of thought was a lot less oil than I’d been expecting. Reserving worry, I set up another column on that stuff, and this time the whole column turned black again, and nothing at all came out the other end but slightly discolored solvent. I had, in fact, destroyed my entire huge batch, because at 2 AM I was too groggy to remember that I was supposed to work it up with saturated bicarb, not ammonium chloride. All gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there, alone, in the middle of the night, looking at all the mess I’d created. Ruined, all that batch of material that was going to finally get my synthesis finished and get me out of this place. I shook my head, cursed loudly, and went home, and to my surprise I fell asleep fairly quickly. What else was there to do? I woke up the next morning and went through that terrible disorienting feeling when after a few seconds you suddenly remember that something bad happened the night before. And then I got up and went to the lab, and set up an even larger batch back at the beginning of the synthesis, step one. Looking back, that night and that morning were a key episode in my graduate career and my life in general, because that batch I started that next day really did get me out in the end. I had bent and come very close to breaking at times, but it turned out that the worst had happened and I was still in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things definitely could have gone in other ways, though, and if they had there’s no telling where I would be now or what I would be doing. If that incident had happened to me a year before, I don’t know how I would have taken it. By the time I speak of, I had my eyes on the door and a PhD defense, having decided that the shortest way out of this awful situation was in that direction. I was devoting all my efforts to it, in an “OK, did today get me closer to defending, or not?” sort of way. Earlier, though, I was too far from the beginning and too far from the end to have that mindset, and a whopping failure would not have gone down well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important for graduate students to realize that &lt;em&gt;everyone has these doubts and bad stretches&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone has these moments when they wonder what they’ve done to their lives, but having these thoughts is &lt;em&gt;not a sign&lt;/em&gt; that the exact failure you’re fearing has arrived. That doesn’t mean that thinking about your purpose in grad school is a bad thing, but it probably is a bad thing to try to do it at periods of peak emotional stress. If you feel that it really is getting too much, definitely talk to someone. Universities have people around for just that purpose – more so than in my day, fortunately – and if you find yourself wondering if you should reach out like that, then odds are that you should. Do it. I wish some of the people I worked with had, or had been able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any meaningful graduate degree is going to be a test of your abilities and your resilience. Recognize this, and avoid the two extremes. On one end are the macho types whose response is “Eat stress for breakfast! That’s what I did in my day! If you don’t have the fire in your belly you don’t belong here!”. And on the other end are the voices, some perhaps external and some internal, telling you that you’re a failure already, an imposter, and that you’re never going to measure up anyway. These are two different sets of lies, and everyone has to steer their course between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2809f37c</fingerprint><keywords><item>Graduate School</item></keywords><description>According to this new survey, depression and anxiety are far more common among graduate students than in the general population.

Sublethal heat stress may weaken bed bug infestations to potentially ease control. In the present study, experimental populations exposed to 34, 36 or 38°C for 2 or 3 weeks suffered significant mortality during exposure. Among survivors, egg production, egg hatching, moulting success and offspring proliferation decreased significantly in the subsequent 7 week recovery period at 22°C. The overall population success was negatively impacted by increasing temperature and duration of the stress. Such heat stress is inadequate as a single tool for eradication, but may be included as a low cost part of an integrated pest management protocol.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;People with low health literacy are more likely to delay seeking care and experience adverse outcomes. While health literacy is the product of individuals’ capacities, it is also affected by the complexities of the health care system.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;People with low health literacy are more likely to delay seeking care and experience adverse outcomes. While health literacy is the product of individuals’ capacities, it is also affected by the complexities of the health care system. System-level changes are needed to align health care demands better with the public’s skills and abilities. We aimed to identify the evidence base for effective strategies for creating health literate organisations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review and narrative synthesis of empirical studies was performed. Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and CINHAL databases were searched for empirical studies from OECD countries published from 2008 onwards, focusing on health literacy interventions at the organisational level.

Terrestrial arthropods play an important role in saltmarsh ecosystems, mainly affecting the saltmarsh’s primary production as the main consumers of terrestrial primary production and decomposition. Some of these arthropods, including selected insects and spiders, can be used as ecological indicators of overall marsh environmental health, as they are differentially sensitive to ecological stressors, such as land loss, erosion, oil spills, and tropical storms. In the present study, we used terrestrial arthropods collected from seven (three lightly-oiled, four heavily-oiled) sites in Barataria Bay and from three unoiled reference sites in Delacroix, Louisiana, to determine the impacts of the distribution and re-distribution of &lt;i&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/i&gt; (DWH) oil on these saltmarsh ecosystems. A total of 9,476 and 12,256 insects were collected in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The results show that the terrestrial arthropods were negatively affected by the re-distribution of DWH oil by Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although the level of impacts varied among the arthropod groups. Moreover, the mean diversity index was higher (&gt;1.5) in 2014 than in 2013 (&amp;lt;1.5) for all sites, suggesting a recovery trajectory of the saltmarsh arthropod population. The higher taxonomic richness observed in the reference sites compared to the oiled sites for both years also indicated long-term impacts of DWH oil to the saltmarsh arthropod community. Whereas a slow recovery of certain terrestrial arthropods was observed, long-term monitoring of arthropod communities would help better understand the recovery and succession of the marsh ecosystems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>24bf6159</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wokil Bam, Linda M.

Novel rutin-loaded zein-sodium caseinate nanoparticles (ZP) with antioxidant activity in aqueous medium were investigated. The results showed that the sodium caseinate concentrations, dosages of rutin and ethanol volume fractions significantly affected the zein nanoparticles’ characteristics. Concerning the antioxidant properties, the highest values of rutin loaded ZP obtained using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging and 2 and 2&apos;-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) decolourisation assays were 52.7% and 71.2%, respectively, and the total antioxidant capacity was 0.40 nmol g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Recent comparative genomics studies have suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the major processes in bacterial evolution. In this study, HGT events of 64 &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; strains were investigated based on the pipeline employed in HGTree database constructed in our recent study. Tree reconciliation method was applied in order to calculate feasible HGT events. Following initial detection and an evaluation procedure, evidence of the HGT was identified in 548 gene families including 42 gene families transferred from outside of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydiae&lt;/i&gt; phylum with high reliability. The donor species of inter-phylum HGT consists of 12 different bacterial and archaeal phyla, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; might have even more various host range than in previous reports. In addition, each species of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; showed varying preference towards HGT, and genes engaged in HGT within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; and between other species showed different functional distribution. Also, examination of individual gene flows of niche-specific genes suggested that many of such genes are transferred mainly within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genus. Our results uncovered novel features of HGT acting on &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genome evolution, and it would be also strong evidence that HGT is an ongoing process for intracellular pathogens. We expect that the results provide more insight into lineage- and niche-specific adaptations regarding their infectivity and pathogenicity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f9fcd9df</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyaekang Kim, Woori Kwak, Sook Hee Yoon, Dae-Kyung Kang, Heebal Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Reporter virus is a versatile tool to visualize and to analyze virus infections. However, for flaviviruses, it is difficult to maintain the inserted reporter genes on the viral genome, limiting its use in several studies that require homogeneous virus particles and several rounds of virus replication. Here, we showed that flanking inserted GFP genes on both sides with ribosome-skipping 2A sequences improved the stability and the consistency of their fluorescent signals for dengue-virus-serotype 2 (DENV2) reporter viruses. The reporter viruses can infect known susceptible mammalian cell lines and primary CD14+ human monocytes. This design can accommodate several fluorescent protein genes, enabling the generation of multi-color DENV2-16681 reporter viruses with comparable replication capabilities, as demonstrated by their abilities to maintain their fluorescent intensities during co-infections and to exclude superinfections regardless of the fluorescent tags. The reported design of multi-color DENV2 should be useful for high-throughput analyses, single-cell analysis, and characterizations of interference and superinfection in animal models.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>150c3bc8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amporn Suphatrakul, Thaneeya Duangchinda, Natapong Jupatanakul, Kanjanawadee Prasittisa, Suppachoke Onnome, Jutharat Pengon, Bunpote Siridechadilok&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing breastfeeding rates have been associated with reductions in disease in babies and mothers as well as in related costs. ‘Nourishing Start for Health (NoSH)’, a financial incentive scheme has been proposed as a potentially effective way to increase both the number of mothers breastfeeding and duration of breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt; Aims &lt;p&gt;To establish women’s relative preferences for different aspects of a financial incentive scheme for breastfeeding and to identify importance of scheme characteristics on probability on participation in an incentive scheme.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A discrete choice experiment (DCE) obtained information on alternative specifications of the NoSH scheme designed to promote continued breastfeeding duration until at least 6 weeks after birth. Four attributes framed alternative scheme designs: value of the incentive; minimum breastfeeding duration required to receive incentive; method of verifying breastfeeding; type of incentive. Three versions of the DCE questionnaire, each containing 8 different choice sets, provided 24 choice sets for analysis. The questionnaire was mailed to 2,531 women in the South Yorkshire Cohort (SYC) aged 16–45 years in IMD quintiles 3–5. The analytic approach considered conditional and mixed effects logistic models to account for preference heterogeneity that may be associated with a variation in effects mediated by respondents’ characteristics.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;564 women completed the questionnaire and a response rate of 22% was achieved. Most of the included attributes were found to affect utility and therefore the probability to participate in the incentive scheme. Higher rewards were preferred, although the type of incentive significantly affected women’s preferences on average. We found evidence for preference heterogeneity based on individual characteristics that mediated preferences for an incentive scheme.ConclusionsAlthough participants’ opinion in our sample was mixed, financial incentives for breastfeeding may be an acceptable and effective instrument to change behaviour. However, individual characteristics could mediate the effect and should therefore be considered when developing and targeting future interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>83736884</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frauke Becker, Nana Anokye, Esther W. de Bekker-Grob, Ailish Higgins, Clare Relton, Mark Strong, Julia Fox-Rushby&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the included attributes were found to affect utility and therefore the probability to participate in the incentive scheme. Higher rewards were preferred, although the type of incentive significantly affected women’s preferences on average. We found evidence for preference heterogeneity based on individual characteristics that mediated preferences for an incentive scheme.ConclusionsAlthough participants’ opinion in our sample was mixed, financial incentives for breastfeeding may be an acceptable and effective instrument to change behaviour. However, individual characteristics could mediate the effect and should therefore be considered when developing and targeting future interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194231</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194231</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Women’s preferences for alternative financial incentive schemes for breastfeeding: A discrete choice experiment</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><published>1523566800000</published><author><name>Frauke Becker</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194231</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7126:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Impact of evolving greenhouse gas forcing on the warming signal in regional climate model experiments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impact of evolving greenhouse gas forcing on the warming signal in regional climate model experiments, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03527-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03527-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The inclusion of greenhouse gas forcing in regional climate model experiments is a non-regulated, non-documented practice.

The Salmon louse (&lt;i&gt;Lepeophtheirus salmonis&lt;/i&gt;) is a marine ectoparasite of salmonid fish in the Northern Hemisphere and considered as a major challenge in aquaculture and a threat to wild populations of salmonids. Adult female lice produce a large number of lipid-rich eggs, however, the mechanism of maternal lipid transport into developing eggs during salmon louse reproduction has not been described. In the present study, a full-length &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt; lipophorin receptor (&lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt;) consisting of 16 exons was obtained by RACE and RT-PCR. The predicted ORF was 952 amino acids and structural analysis showed five functional domains that are similar to LpR of insects and decapods. Phylogenetic analysis placed the LsLpR together with LpRs from decapods and insects. Expression analysis revealed that the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts was highest in the larvae and adult female lice. In adult females, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts and protein were found in the ovary and vitellogenic oocytes whereas, in larvae, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts were found in the neuronal somata of the brain and the intestine. Oil Red O stain results revealed that storage of neutral lipids was found in vitellogenic oocytes and ovaries of adult females, and in the yolk of larvae. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) was conducted to demonstrate the function of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; in reproduction and lipid metabolism in &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt;. In larvae, the transcription of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; was decreased by 44–54% while in an experiment &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; knockdown female lice produced 72% less offspring than control lice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f5ffbd1c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Tanveer Khan, Sussie Dalvin, Qaiser Waheed, Frank Nilsen, Rune Male&lt;/p&gt;

The structure and function of clinical dosage insulin and its analogues were assessed. This included ‘native insulins’ (human recombinant, bovine, porcine), ‘fast-acting analogues’ (aspart, glulisine, lispro) and ‘slow-acting analogues’ (glargine, detemir, degludec). Analytical ultracentrifugation, both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments, were employed to yield distributions of both molar mass and sedimentation coefficient of all nine insulins. Size exclusion chromatography, coupled to multi-angle light scattering, was also used to explore the function of these analogues. On ultracentrifugation analysis, the insulins under investigation were found to be in numerous conformational states, however the majority of insulins were present in a primarily hexameric conformation. This was true for all native insulins and two fast-acting analogues. However, glargine was present as a dimer, detemir was a multi-hexameric system, degludec was a dodecamer (di-hexamer) and glulisine was present as a dimer-hexamer-dihexamer system. However, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the two hexameric fast-acting analogues (aspart and lispro) dissociated into monomers and dimers due to the lack of zinc in the mobile phase. This comprehensive study is the first time all nine insulins have been characterised in this way, the first time that insulin detemir have been studied using analytical ultracentrifugation and the first time that insulins aspart and glulisine have been studied using sedimentation equilibrium. The structure and function of these clinically administered insulins is of critical importance and this research adds novel data to an otherwise complex functional physiological protein.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>72e2dd6e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gary G.

Haploid laboratory strains of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; are commonly used for genetic engineering to enable their xylose utilization but little is known about the industrial yeast which is often recognized as diploid and as well as haploid and tetraploid. Here we report three unique signature pathway expression patterns and gene interactions in the centre metabolic pathways that signify xylose utilization of genetically engineered industrial yeast &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; NRRL Y-50463, a diploid yeast. Quantitative expression analysis revealed outstanding high levels of constitutive expression of &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt;, a synthesized yeast codon-optimized xylose isomerase gene integrated into chromosome XV of strain Y-50463. Comparative expression analysis indicated that the &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt; was necessary to initiate the xylose metabolic pathway along with a set of heterologous xylose transporter and utilization facilitating genes including &lt;i&gt;XUT4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;XUT6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;XKS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;XYL2&lt;/i&gt;.

The significantly increased expression of the entire &lt;i&gt;PRS&lt;/i&gt; gene family facilitates functions of the life cycle and biosynthesis superpathway for the yeast. The outstanding higher levels of constitutive expression of &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt; and the first insight into the signature pathway expression and the gene interactions in the closely related centre metabolic pathways from the industrial yeast aid continued efforts for development of the next-generation biocatalyst.

Our results further suggest the industrial yeast is a desirable delivery vehicle for new strain development for efficient lignocellulose-to-advanced biofuels production.</description><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195633</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195633</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Signature pathway expression of xylose utilization in the genetically engineered industrial yeast &amp;lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><published>1522962000000</published><author><name>Quanzhou Feng</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195633</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195633</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d74a:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03171-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Reforms put in place after Ebola epidemic in West Africa have built Nigeria&apos;s capacity to diagnose diseases and track their spread.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>97f70333</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03171-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Reforms put in place after Ebola epidemic in West Africa have built Nigeria&apos;s capacity to diagnose diseases and track their spread.</description><crawled>1521129397322</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y</href></item></alternate><engagement>19</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency</title><unread>False</unread><published>1521097200000</published><author><name>Amy Maxmen</name></author><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y</originId><recrawled>1521130681627</recrawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03171-y/d41586-018-03171-y_15530340.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1622a609c4a:ba1f76:34f43e70</id></item><item><fingerprint>3333d881</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00152/20180403/images/medium/jm-2018-001529_0013.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00152&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Hydraulic fracturing can improve the permeability of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs effectively, which is of great significance to the commercial production of CBM. However, the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing is affected by multiple factors. The mechanism of fracture initiation, morphology and propagation in CBM reservoirs is not clear and need to be further explored. Hydraulic fracturing experiment is an accurate tool to explore these mechanisms. The quantity of experimental coal rock is large and processing method is complex, so specimen made of similar materials was applied to replace coal rock. The true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experimental apparatus, 3D scanning device for coal rock section were applied to carry out hydraulic fracturing experiment. The results show that the initiation pressure is inversely proportional to the horizontal stress difference (Δσ) and positively related to fracturing fluid injection rate. When vertical stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) is constant, the initiation pressure and fracture width decrease with the increasing of Δσ. Natural fractures can be connected by main fracture when propagates perpendicular to the direction of minimum horizontal stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;), then secondary fractures and fracture network form in CBM reservoirs. When two stresses of crustal stress are close and far different from the third one, the fracture morphology and propagation become complex. Influenced by perforations and filtration of fracturing fluid in specimen, fracturing fluid flows to downward easily after comparing horizontal well fracturing with vertical well fracturing. Fracture width increases with the decreasing of elastic modulus, the intensity of fracture is positively related with the elastic modulus of coal rock. The research results can provide theoretical basis and technical support for the efficient development of CBM.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>90602380</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fan Zhang, Geng Ma, Xiao Liu, Yunqi Tao, Dan Feng, Rui Li&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the expansion of literature on social accountability in low-and middle-income countries, little is known about how health providers experience daily social pressure and citizen feedback. This study used a narrative inquiry approach to explore the function of daily social accountability relations among maternal health care workers in rural Malawi. Through semi-structured interviews with 32 nurses and 19 clinicians, we collected 155 feedback cases allowing the identification of four main strategies social actors use to express their opinion and concerns about maternal health services. We found that women who used delivery care express their appreciation for successful deliveries directly to the health worker but complaints, such as on absenteeism and poor interpersonal behaviour, follow an indirect route via intermediaries such as the health workers’ spouse, co-workers or the health committee who forward some cases of misbehaviour to district authorities. The findings suggest that citizen feedback is important for the socialization, motivation and retention of maternal healthcare workers in under resourced rural settings. Practitioners and external development programmes should understand and recognize the value of already existing accountability mechanisms and foster social accountability approaches that allow communities as well as health workers to challenge the systemic obstacles to quality and respectful service delivery.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>19e35342</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elsbet Lodenstein, Christine Ingemann, Joyce M.

Although several studies have demonstrated a potential correlation of dietary patterns with cognitive function, the relationship between tooth loss and dietary patterns and cognitive function have not been identified. In this cross-sectional study, we used a reduced rank regression (RRR) analysis, a technique used previously to observe dietary patterns based on the intakes of nutrients or levels of biomarkers associated with the condition of interest, to identify tooth loss-related dietary patterns and investigate the associations of such patterns with cognitive impairment in 334 community-dwelling Japanese subjects aged ≥ 60 years. According to Pearson correlation coefficients, the intakes of six nutrients (ash content, sodium, zinc, vitamin B1, α- and β-carotene) correlated significantly with the number of remaining teeth. Using RRR analysis, we extracted four dietary patterns in our subject population that explained 86.67% of the total variation in the intakes of these six nutrients. Particularly, dietary pattern 1 (DP1) accounted for 52.2% of the total variation. Food groups with factor loadings of ≥ 0.2 included pickled green leafy vegetables, lettuce/cabbage, green leaves vegetables, cabbage, carrots/squash; by contrast, rice had a factor loading of &amp;lt;−0.2. In a multivariate regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratios regarding the prevalence of cognitive impairment for the lowest, middle and highest tertiles of the DP1 score were 1.00 (reference), 1.224 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.611–2.453) and 0.427 (95% CI: 0.191–0.954), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that tooth loss-related dietary patterns are associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment. These results may motivate changes in dental treatment and the dietary behaviours and thereby lower the risk of cognitive impairment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9a28d4ea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Ishimiya, Hiroyuki Nakamura, Yutaka Kobayashi, Moeko Noguchi-Shinohara, Chiemi Abe, Chiaki Dohmoto, Yoshihisa Ikeda, Kahori Tokuno, Kazuhiro Ooi, Masami Yokokawa, Kazuo Iwasa, Kiyonobu Komai, Shuichi Kawashiri, Masahito Yamada&lt;/p&gt;

Numerous factors affect how people choose a fine dining restaurant, including food quality, service quality, food safety, and hedonic value. A conceptual framework for evaluating restaurant selection behavior has not yet been developed. This study surveyed 150 individuals with fine dining experience and proposed the use of mental accounting and axiomatic design to construct a consumer economic behavior model. Linear and logistic regressions were employed to determine model correlations and the probability of each factor affecting behavior. The most crucial factor was food quality, followed by service and dining motivation, particularly regarding family dining. Safe ingredients, high cooking standards, and menu innovation all increased the likelihood of consumers choosing fine dining restaurants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>773d0fd3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sheng-Hsun Hsu, Cheng-Fu Hsiao, Sang-Bing Tsai&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Measuring viral DNA methylation in human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women showed promise for accurate detection of high-grade cervical lesions and cancer. Methylation status has been widely investigated for HPV16, sporadically for other HPV types.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Objective of this methodological study was to set up molecular methods to test the methylation levels in the twelve oncogenic HPV types by pyrosequencing, minimizing the number of HPV type-specific PCR protocols. Target CpGs were selected on the HPV L1 (two regions, L1 I and L1 II) and L2 genes.Study samples included DNA stored at Turin, Italy, purified by cervical cells collected in Standard Transport Medium or PreservCyt from women who participated in two studies (N = 126 and 140) nested within the regional organized screening programme.PCR consensus primers were designed by PyroMark Assay Design software to be suitable for amplification of many different oncogenic HPV types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Generation of consensus primers was successful for L1 I and II regions, unsuccessful for L2 region, for which HPV type-specific primers remained necessary. The difference between replicated tests on the same sample was ≤4% in 88%, 77% and 91% of cases when targeting the L1 I, L1 II and L2 regions, respectively. The corresponding intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were 0.94, 0.87 and 0.97 respectively. When comparing methylation measures based on consensus and type-specific primers, ICC was 0.97 for the L1 I region and 0.99 the for L1 II region.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The proposed protocols, applying consensus primers suitable to amplify the oncogenic HPV types and minimize the number of PCR reactions, represent a promising tool to quantify viral methylation in women positive for any high risk HPV type.&lt;/p&gt; Impact &lt;p&gt;Potential application of these methylation protocols in screening settings can be explored to identify women with high probability of progression to high grade lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>62cf8271</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Gillio-Tos, Valentina Fiano, Chiara Grasso, Morena Trevisan, Silvia Gori, Alessandra Mongia, Laura De Marco, Guglielmo Ronco, and the New Technologies for Cervical Cancer Screening (NTCC) Working Group &lt;/p&gt;

Offspring survival is generally more variable than adult survival and may limit population growth. Although white-tailed deer neonate survival has been intensively investigated, recent work has emphasized how specific cover types influence neonate survival at local scales (single study area). These localized investigations have often led to inconsistences within the literature. Developing specific hypotheses describing the relationships among environmental, habitat, and landscape factors influencing white-tailed deer neonate survival at regional scales may allow for detection of generalized patterns. Therefore, we developed 11 hypotheses representing the various effects of environmental (e.g., winter and spring weather), habitat (e.g., hiding and escape cover types), and landscape factors (e.g., landscape configuration regardless of specific cover type available) on white-tailed deer neonate survival up to one-month and from one- to three-months of age. At one-month, surviving fawns experienced a warmer lowest recorded June temperature and more June precipitation than those that perished. At three-months, patch connectance (percent of patches of the corresponding patch type that are connected within a predefined distance) positively influenced survival. Our results are consistent with white-tailed deer neonate ecology: increased spring temperature and precipitation are likely associated with a flush of nutritional resources available to the mother, promoting increased lactation efficiency and neonate growth early in life. In contrast, reduced spring temperature with increased precipitation place neonates at risk to hypothermia. Increased patch connectance likely reflects increased escape cover available within a neonate’s home range after they are able to flee from predators. If suitable escape cover is available on the landscape, then managers could focus efforts towards manipulating landscape configuration (patch connectance) to promote increased neonate survival while monitoring spring weather to assess potential influences on current year survival.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2ecedc0e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric S.

We sought to measure the response of cortisol concentrations around a professional tennis match and its association with hydration status and neuromuscular performance. Nine professional male tennis players were tested in a rest day, and 2-week after, during the first match of a professional tournament played in a clay-court. Salivary concentrations of cortisol (SalCC) were measured in a resting day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm), at the match day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm) and immediately before and after the match. Hydration status was assessed before the match (urine specific gravity; USG) while fluid turnover was tracked during the match. Finally, counter movement jump (CMJ) and handgrip isometric strength (HS) were measured before and after the match. SalCC, either in the morning (P = 0.161) and afternoon (P = 0.683) was similar in rest and match days. However, SalCC increased after the match (P = 0.033). Participants started the match hypohydrated (USG = 1.026±0.002) and during the match lost 1.0±0.3% of body weight despite 1.035±0.124 L/h of fluid ingested. CMJ and HS did not change post-match (P = 0.210 and P = 0.881, respectively). Correlations between the elevations in SalCC and dehydration (% BW loss) during the match were significant (r = -0.632; P = 0.034). Professional male tennis players did not show an anticipatory increase in SalCC the day of the match and neither signs of neuromuscular fatigue after it. During the match, the mild dehydration (i.e., &amp;lt;1.5%) was associated with the increases in cortisol levels which suggests that dehydration may be an added stress to be considered.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4405404f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Álvaro López-Samanes, Jesús G.

Salivary concentrations of cortisol (SalCC) were measured in a resting day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm), at the match day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm) and immediately before and after the match. Hydration status was assessed before the match (urine specific gravity; USG) while fluid turnover was tracked during the match. Finally, counter movement jump (CMJ) and handgrip isometric strength (HS) were measured before and after the match. SalCC, either in the morning (P = 0.161) and afternoon (P = 0.683) was similar in rest and match days. However, SalCC increased after the match (P = 0.033). Participants started the match hypohydrated (USG = 1.026±0.002) and during the match lost 1.0±0.3% of body weight despite 1.035±0.124 L/h of fluid ingested. CMJ and HS did not change post-match (P = 0.210 and P = 0.881, respectively). Correlations between the elevations in SalCC and dehydration (% BW loss) during the match were significant (r = -0.632; P = 0.034). Professional male tennis players did not show an anticipatory increase in SalCC the day of the match and neither signs of neuromuscular fatigue after it. During the match, the mild dehydration (i.e., &amp;lt;1.5%) was associated with the increases in cortisol levels which suggests that dehydration may be an added stress to be considered.</description><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Hormonal and neuromuscular responses during a singles match in male professional tennis players</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><published>1523048400000</published><author><name>Álvaro López-Samanes</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd072:7c9981b6</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zeng, Dorian Garrick, Jack Dekkers, Rohan Fernando&lt;/p&gt;
Genomic prediction exploits single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome for predicting genetic merit of selection candidates. In most models for genomic prediction, e.g. BayesA, B, C, R and GBLUP, independence of SNP effects is assumed. However, SNP effects are expected to be locally dependent given the presence of a nearby QTL because SNPs surrounding the QTL do not segregate independently. A consequence of ignoring this dependence is that SNPs with small effects may be overly shrunk, e.g. effects from markers with high minor allele frequencies (MAF) that flank QTL with low MAF. A nested mixture model (BayesN) is developed to account for the dependence of effects of SNPs that are closely linked, where the effects of SNPs in every non-overlapping genomic window &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; follow a point mass at zero for all SNPs or a mixture of some SNPs with nonzero effects and others with zero effects. It can be regarded as a parsimonious alternative to the existing antedependence model, antiBayesB, which allow a nonstationary dependence of SNP effects. Illumina 777K BovineHD genotypes from 948 Angus cattle were used to simulate 5,000 offspring, with 4,000 used for training and 1,000 for validation. Scenarios with 300 common (MAF &gt; 0.05) or rare (MAF &amp;lt; 0.05) QTL randomly selected from segregating SNPs were replicated 8 times. SNPs corresponding to QTL were masked from a 600k panel comprising SNPs with MAF &gt; 0.05 or a 50k evenly spaced subset of these. Compared with BayesB and a modified antiBayesB, BayesN improved the accuracy of prediction up to 2.0% with 50k SNPs and up to 7.0% with 600k SNPs, most improvements occurring in the rare QTL scenario. Computing time was reduced up to 60% with 50k SNPs and up to 75% with 600k SNPs. BayesN is an accurate and computationally efficient method for genomic prediction with whole-genome SNPs, especially for traits with rare QTL.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2b0a2650</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zeng, Dorian Garrick, Jack Dekkers, Rohan Fernando&lt;/p&gt;

I can state as a fact that the first time I heard a joking reference to his attitude towards traditional synthetic organic chemistry was in the summer of 1983, so it’s not like he’s been keeping his thoughts bottled up. But this is certainly a good summary of them, and here’s the key question that’s being asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The ability to put together molecules – bit‐by‐bit, simple or complex – is one of chemistry’s great accomplishments, and a source of amazement to those in many other fields of science. More than one physicist has told me that s/he cannot believe that it is possible to manipulate bonds between individual atoms with the skill that organic chemists do. When I look at a complex structure assembled in a beautifully organized campaign, I also am amazed. That said, all fields of science morph with time. The phrase “organic synthesis” has come to mean “synthesis of structurally complex natural products”, or, perhaps, “synthesis of complicated molecules with pharmaceutical activity.” Nature, and relevance to healthcare, define the targets, and provide the utilitarian justification for the effort. Is there (or should there be) more to it than that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidiary questions are whether organic synthesis of that sort is worth the effort that’s being put into it and whether it trains students to do useful things and whether other types of work could do a better job of that. In order to address these, Whitesides notes, we have to make sure that we’re talking about the same things. He defines “organic synthesis” (small letters) as any sort of putting-together-of-organic molecules, and “Organic Synthesis” (with the capitals) as the sort of complex and often natural-product-based synthesis practiced by R. B. Woodward, his contemporaries, and his intellectual heirs. The latter is what many people mean by those two words, to be sure, and Whitesides has some questions about just what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the field a science that generates new concepts and new theory? Is it instead more of an art form, driven at least partly by aesthetic choices (that can be appreciated by skilled observers) rather than utility &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;? Or is it something of a craft, achieving its results (in the end) through skilled empirical tinkering? These questions, especially in the way that they’re phrased, are likely to cause intense annoyance in some practitioners. But I think that the annoyance is a sign that these categories are uncomfortably plausible and recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the field partakes of all of these characteristics, but on what proportions? I think that the science/craft distinction is actually one question, and that these are on the same scale with opposite signs: the more solid the theoretical framework, the less Edisonian tinkering. My opinion is toward the Edisonian end. Organic synthesis is not bereft of theories and organizing concepts, but they do not operate strongly enough (that is, in a detailed enough fashion) to allow us to predict (for example) reaction conditions. That’s why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. The same goes for predicting new reactions, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/11/24/reaction_discovery_reviewed&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. No one sat down a few decades ago and said “Y’know, my knowledge of organometallic chemistry allows me to predict that palladium, in particular, will show oxidative addition/reductive elimination behavior that will be spectacularly useful in carbon-carbon bond formation. And while I’m making bold predictions, you might try aryl boronic acids for that reaction first, even though hardly any such things have even been described”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for art, I would very much like to have a dollar for every total-synthesis person who has talked about the field in terms of its artistic qualities. We have Woodward to thank for this – the man was a &lt;em&gt;tremendous&lt;/em&gt; scientist, but his influence has &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/22/woodwards-prose-style&quot;&gt;not always been&lt;/a&gt; for the good. I don’t think nearly as many people went into spasms about elegance and beauty in reference to total synthesis before him, and what’s more annoying is that those are valid concepts to apply even if Woodward sometimes came across like an Aubrey Beardsley aesthete about them. My own view is that we should let the artistic qualities of organic synthesis, which exist, speak for themselves. Because if they can’t, no amount of &lt;em&gt;raffiniert&lt;/em&gt; gushing about them will substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitesides isn’t through. That three-parter is just his first of three questions! The second one is a two-parter: is organic synthesis best thought of as an enabling technology to do things (such as make drugs, etc.) or as a framework that lets us ask questions about the nature of molecules and their behavior? That is, are the uses to which we put this field, and the justifications we give for it, best described as practical ones or intellectual ones? We tend to haul out the former first and start talking in better-living-through-(organic)-chemistry style, and that’s understandable. Compounds made through organic synthesis, and available through no other practical means, are crucial underpinnings of the modern world. If we’re not proud of that, what are we to be proud of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that second justification, while it sounds like more aesthetic hand-waving to the lay public (and to funding agencies), has some staying power. Ask the physicists, or even the mathematicians. Asking fundamental questions, and having the right framework in which to be able to ask them, can pay off hugely even from the practical end, intellectual satisfaction aside. There’s a lot of number theory that was just another ornament of mathematics until it became vital for modern cryptography and secure communications (G. H. Hardy would have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2IK9D0o&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;horrified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Relativity was a fantastic intellectual feat by Einstein, but relativistic corrections are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html&quot;&gt;needed&lt;/a&gt; to make the GPS system work correctly, among many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third question is, what should we teach chemistry students about the field? That is, what are the most important things for them to know? There’s a massive pile of empirical knowledge, famously dreaded by sophomores, but it’s taught (or should be!) according to general organizing principles – although those are the very ones that are not quite adequate enough to explain everything that’s going on. At what level should we teach this subject? You can say “Here are reactions that depend on alpha-carbonyl anions, and here’s why they happen”, you can say “Time to learn the difference between the Dieckmann and Claisen condensations”, or “Here are the kinds of products these reactions form and what they’re used for”, or “Here are some tips on how to run these things at the bench”, and on and on. What should be in the syllabus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own take on this is that there should definitely be a bias towards the general principles, which is what the better organic chemistry professors already do. Teaching the subject as a pile of reactions is a crime. I may be too loose about this stuff, but I would rather a student, if it came down to it, mess up a bit on the detailed mechanism of the Mitsunobu reaction if they understand that its driving force is the thermodynamic sink of triphenylphosphine oxide formation. The difference between the Dieckmann and the Claisen condensations is that the former is intramolecular and the latter is intermolecular, but I think it’s a waste of brain space to give them different names and memorize them as such. I would much rather that a student, in this case, immediately recognize the mechanism of an alpha-carbonyl anion attacking an ester carbonyl (no matter what the name associated with that process is) and recognize the influence of the leaving group of the ester, the stability vs. reactivity characteristics of the nucleophile, the likelihood of the various ring sizes being formed in the intramolecular reaction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nowhere near exhausted the Annoying Questions of George Whitesides, but this post is long enough as it is!

The signaling scaffold protein GIT1 is expressed widely throughout the brain, but its function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains elusive. Mice lacking GIT1 have been proposed as a model for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, due to alterations in basal locomotor activity as well as paradoxical locomotor suppression by the psychostimulant amphetamine. Since we had previously shown that GIT1-knockout mice have normal locomotor activity, here we examined GIT1-deficient mice for ADHD-like behavior in more detail, and find neither hyperactivity nor amphetamine-induced locomotor suppression. Instead, GIT1-deficient mice exhibit profound learning and memory defects and reduced synaptic structural plasticity, consistent with an intellectual disability phenotype. We conclude that loss of GIT1 alone is insufficient to drive a robust ADHD phenotype in distinct strains of mice. In contrast, multiple learning and memory defects have been observed here and in other studies using distinct GIT1-knockout lines, consistent with a predominant intellectual disability phenotype related to altered synaptic structural plasticity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f97b806f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amanda C.

The anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and cytoprotective activity of the &lt;i&gt;Attalea phalerata&lt;/i&gt; Mart. ex Spreng pulp oil was evaluated by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; methods. As for the chemical profile, the antioxidant activity was performed by spectrophotometry, and the profile of carotenoids and amino acids by chromatography. Our data demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;phalerata&lt;/i&gt; oil has high carotenoid content, antioxidant activity and the presence of 5 essential amino acids. In the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models of inflammation, the oil demonstrated the capacity to inhibit COX1 and COX2 enzymes, the production of nitric oxide and also induces macrophages to spreading. In the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models of inflammation, the oil inhibited edema and leukocyte migration in the &lt;i&gt;Wistar&lt;/i&gt; rats. In the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of antiproliferative and cytoprotective activity, the oil was shown inactive against the kidney carcinoma and prostate carcinoma lineage cells and with cytoprotective capacity in murine fibroblast cells, inhibiting the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype E almost exclusively occurs in African people, and its presence is more commonly associated with the development of chronic HBV (CHB) infection. Moreover, an epidemiological link has been found between the distribution of HBV genotype E infection and African countries with high incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma. As part of a programme for the health assessment of migrants, we evaluated 358 young African subjects for HBV infection; 58.1% (208/358) were positive for an HBV marker, and 54 (25.5%) had CHB. Eighty-one percent of the CHB subjects were infected with HBV genotype E, with a median serum HBV-DNA of 3.2 (IQR: 2.7–3.6) logIU/ml. All patients had high serum HBsAg titres (10,899 [range 5,359–20,272] IU/ml), and no correlation was found between HBsAg titres and HBV-DNA plasma levels. RT sequence analysis showed the presence of a number of immune escape mutations: strains from all of the patients had a serine at HBsAg position 140; 3 also had T116N, Y100C, and P142L+S143L substitutions; and 1 had a G112R substitution. Six (18%) patients had stop-codons at position 216. In 5 of the 9 (26.5%) CHB patients, ultrasound liver biopsy, quantification of total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA, and RT/HBsAg sequencing were performed. The median (IQR) total intrahepatic HBV-DNA was 766 (753–1139) copies/1000 cells, and the median (IQR) cccDNA was 17 (10–27) copies/1000 cells. Correlations were observed for both total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA with serum HBV-DNA, while no correlation was found for the HBsAg titres. A difference of 2.5/1,000 nucleotides was found in the HBsAg sequences obtained from plasma and from liver tissue, with 3 cases of possible viral anatomical compartmentalization. In conclusion, a high rate of CHB infection due to the E genotype was demonstrated in a group of immigrants from Western Africa. An analysis of the viral strains obtained showed the virological characteristics of immune escape, which may be the cause of viral replication persistence. Moreover, a fair percentage of stop codon mutations were found. The lack of correlation between HBsAg titres and plasma or intrahepatic HBV-DNA found in these subjects suggests a pathway of virus production that is not linked to HBsAg secretion. Studies with a larger number of patients with CHB due to the E genotype are advisable to corroborate these observations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>65b3ef36</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vincenzo Malagnino, Romina Salpini, Gaetano Maffongelli, Arianna Battisti, Lavinia Fabeni, Lorenzo Piermatteo, Luna Colagrossi, Vanessa Fini, Alessandra Ricciardi, Cesare Sarrecchia, Carlo Federico Perno, Massimo Andreoni, Valentina Svicher, Loredana Sarmati&lt;/p&gt;

Studies with a larger number of patients with CHB due to the E genotype are advisable to corroborate these observations.</description><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195045</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195045</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>High rates of chronic HBV genotype E infection in a group of migrants in Italy from West Africa: Virological characteristics associated with poor immune clearance</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><published>1522357200000</published><author><name>Vincenzo Malagnino</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195045</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195045</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1e:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aleikar Vásquez-Suárez, Francisco Lobos-González, Andrew Cronshaw, José Sepúlveda-Ugarte, Maximiliano Figueroa, Jorge Dagnino-Leone, Marta Bunster, José Martínez-Oyanedel&lt;/p&gt;
Phycobilisomes (PBS) are accessory light harvesting protein complexes formed mainly by phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The PBPs absorb light that is efficiently transferred to Photosystems due to chromophores covalently bound to specific cysteine residues. Besides phycobiliproteins (PE), the PBS contains linker proteins responsible for assembly and stabilization of the whole complex and the tuning of energy transfer steps between chromophores. The linker (γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria chilensis&lt;/i&gt;, is a chromophorylated rod linker associated to (αβ)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; hexamers of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE). Its role in the energy transfer process is not clear yet. Structural studies as well as the composition and location of the chromophores are essential to understand their involvement in the energy transfer process in PBS. To achieve this, the coding gene of γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was analyzed by informatics tools, to obtain preliminary information which leaded the next experiments. The protein was purified from R-phycoerythrin, and the sequence confirmed by mass spectrometry. The coding sequence analysis revealed a protein of 318 aminoacid residues containing a chloroplastidial transit peptide (cTP) of 39 aminoacids at the N-terminus. The conservation of cysteines revealed possible chromophorylation sites. Using α and β R-PE subunits as spectroscopic probes in denaturation assays, we deduced a double bonded phycourobilin (PUB) on γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; subunit that were confirmed between Cys62 and Cys73 (DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;62/73&lt;/sup&gt;) by mass spectrometry. The cysteines involved in the double link are located in a helical region, in a conformation that reminds the position of the DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;50/61&lt;/sup&gt; in the β subunit of R-PE. The position of single linked PUB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt; and a single linked PEB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; were also confirmed. Spectroscopic studies show the presence of both types of chromophores and that there are not energy transfer by FRET among them.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7c771e50</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aleikar Vásquez-Suárez, Francisco Lobos-González, Andrew Cronshaw, José Sepúlveda-Ugarte, Maximiliano Figueroa, Jorge Dagnino-Leone, Marta Bunster, José Martínez-Oyanedel&lt;/p&gt;

Wildlife mortality investigations are important for conservation, food safety, and public health; but they are infrequently reported for cryptic chelonian species. Eastern box turtles (&lt;i&gt;Terrapene carolina carolina&lt;/i&gt;) are declining due to anthropogenic factors and disease, and while mortality investigations have been reported for captive and translocated individuals, few descriptions exist for free-living populations. We report the results of four natural mortality event investigations conducted during routine health surveillance of three Illinois box turtle populations in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In April 2011, over 50 box turtles were found dead and a polymicrobial necrotizing bacterial infection was diagnosed in five survivors using histopathology and aerobic/anaerobic culture. This represents the first reported occurrence of necrotizing bacterial infection in box turtles. In August 2013, paired histopathology and qPCR ranavirus detection in nine turtles was significantly associated with occupation of moist microhabitats, identification of oral plaques and nasal discharge on physical exam, and increases in the heterophil count and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In July 2014 and 2015, ranavirus outbreaks reoccurred within a 0.2km radius of highly-disturbed habitat containing ephemeral ponds used by amphibians for breeding. qPCR ranavirus detection in five individuals each year was significantly associated with use of moist microhabitats (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Detection of single and co-pathogens (Terrapene herpesvirus 1, adenovirus, and &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma&lt;/i&gt; sp.) was common before, during, and after mortality events, but improved sample size would be necessary to determine the impacts of these pathogens on the occurrence and outcome of mortality events. This study provides novel information about the causes and predictors of natural box turtle mortality events. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2c9bb0c1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Adamovicz, Matthew C.

Detection of single and co-pathogens (Terrapene herpesvirus 1, adenovirus, and &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma&lt;/i&gt; sp.) was common before, during, and after mortality events, but improved sample size would be necessary to determine the impacts of these pathogens on the occurrence and outcome of mortality events. This study provides novel information about the causes and predictors of natural box turtle mortality events. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</description><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Investigation of multiple mortality events in eastern box turtles (&amp;lt;i&gt;Terrapene carolina carolina&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><published>1522962000000</published><author><name>Laura Adamovicz</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d746:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Development of the African Middle Stone Age (MSA) before 300,000 years ago raises the question of how environmental change influenced the evolution of behaviors characteristic of early &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drug performances depend on the viral genotype. So international recommendations give typing of the virus a prerequisite for treatment choice and patient management. Commercially available HCV genotyping kits are scarce and this analysis is often in-house using tedious PCRs and Sanger sequencing, leading to a lack of standardization. A newly commercialized HCV genotyping assay based on real-time PCR has been developed by Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). We compared this new assay with our in-house PCRs -sequencing technique on 101 regular samples and 81 LiPA failures or low viral load samples. No genotype or 1a/1b subtype mismatch was observed. Two samples were misidentified at the subtype level without clinical impact. Three genotype 1b and two genotype 1a samples with low viral load could not be subtyped. Nevertheless, 13 (13%) samples from the regular panel and 35 (43%) from the more difficult-to-type panels failed to give results on first pass with the Roche kit. Failures were mostly associated with genotype 3 subtype a, with genotype 4 subtype non-a, or with viral loads &amp;lt;200 IU/mL (p = 0.0061). The workflow allowed a non-specialized technician to obtain results in less than 4 hours whereas 2 to 3 days and experienced staff were required with the in-house assay. In conclusion, the Roche cobas&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; HCV GT kit is easy and rapid to use and provides reliable results. The high rate of uninterpretable results particularly for low viral load samples and less frequent genotypes, and the absence of subtyping for non-genotype 1 could require sending complex samples to a specialized laboratory.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>219d8986</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Némoz, Léa Roger, Vincent Leroy, Jean-Dominique Poveda, Patrice Morand, Sylvie Larrat&lt;/p&gt;

Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt; published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>42b24064</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rachel Borchardt, Cullen Moran, Stuart Cantrill, Chemjobber, See Arr Oh, Matthew R.

Based on this result, we used TANDEM, a method for drug response prediction, to identify which variables predictive of drug response were distinct to either gene expression or proteomics.</description><crawled>1522788377956</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293993v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293993v1?rss=1</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>iTOP: Inferring the Topology of Omics Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522738800000</published><author><name>Aben, N.</name></author><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/03/293993</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293993v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1628d42a564:97c97a5:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c938ccad</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021946?af=R</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021946?af=R</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Rotational and fine structure of open-shell molecules in nearly degenerate electronic states</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522134623000</published><author><name>Jinjun Liu</name></author><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021946?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f890a:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>315d57d1</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021502?af=R</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021502?af=R</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Effective diffusion coefficient including the Marangoni effect</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522814371000</published><author><name>Hiroyuki Kitahata</name></author><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021502?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b58:7c9981b6</id></item><item><author><name>Soroush Samadian</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Soroush Samadian, Jeff P.

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world’s largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian S.

Ocular tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes severe inflammation and vision loss in TB-endemic countries. The mechanism by which tuberculous infection becomes established in the eye is poorly understood. We have developed the zebrafish larva infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; as a model to study the early pathogenesis of ocular TB. We find that hematogenous bacterial seeding of the eye occurs despite a functional blood retinal barrier. Prototypical early granulomas form in response to bacteria in the eye. These granulomas involve the retinal vasculature and retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex which are characteristic locations for human ocular TB. We find that peripheral blood monocytes are recruited to the nascent ocular granuloma further suggesting that the immune privileged nature of the eye is breached by this inflammatory focus.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4c6f02bb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Takaki, Lalita Ramakrishnan, Soumyava Basu&lt;/p&gt;

Cadmium exposure can cause renal tubular dysfunction. Recent studies show that vitamin D can play multiple roles in the body. However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium. A total of 133 subjects living in control area and two cadmium polluted areas were included in the present study. Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D ≥ 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1–0.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1–1.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D &amp;lt; 30 ng/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed in those subjects living in cadmium polluted areas or with high level of UCd or BCd. Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2c4ab63a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiao Chen, Yan Dai, Zhongqiu Wang, Guoying Zhu, Xiaoqiang Ding, Taiyi Jin&lt;/p&gt;

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses. The most prominent effect was decreased pelvic rise that occurred as the rider was actively rising up in the stirrups, thus creating a downward momentum counteracting the horses push off. This mimics a push off lameness in the hindlimb that is in stance when the rider sits down in the saddle during the rising trot. On the circle, the asymmetries induced by rising trot on the correct diagonal counteracted the circle induced asymmetries, rendering the horse more symmetrical. This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness. This theory needs to be studied further in clinically lame horses.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b3a0b371</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Persson-Sjodin, Elin Hernlund, Thilo Pfau, Pia Haubro Andersen, Marie Rhodin&lt;/p&gt;

This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness. This theory needs to be studied further in clinically lame horses.</description><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Influence of seating styles on head and pelvic vertical movement symmetry in horses ridden at trot</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><published>1522962000000</published><author><name>Emma Persson-Sjodin</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4615:34f43e70</id></item><item><fingerprint>dd8769a4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00097/20180320/images/medium/cb-2018-00097e_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00097&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury still represents a major concern in clinical transplantation, especially in the era of extreme organ shortage and extended criteria donor organs. In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240–340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;RIC 1 group showed significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>968614f6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zoltan Czigany, Christian Bleilevens, Christian Beckers, Christian Stoppe, Michaela Möhring, Andras Fülöp, Attila Szijarto, Georg Lurje, Ulf P.

Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Limb remote ischemic conditioning of the recipient protects the liver in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><published>1522875600000</published><author><name>Zoltan Czigany</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec7:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><author><name>Annie M.

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling pathways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Annie M.

Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in sheep and an example of a disease that may be controlled through breeding for disease resistance. Member states of the European Union have introduced strategies for breeding against scrapie based on the selection of genetically resistant breeding rams. An ambitious strategy adopted in The Netherlands consisted of selecting resistant rams for breeding throughout both breeding and production sectors. Mathematical modelling of the effect of a breeding program on the spreading capacity of scrapie in a national flock is needed for making assessments on how long a breeding strategy needs to be maintained to achieve disease control. Here we describe such a model applied to the Dutch situation, with the use of data on the genetic content of the Dutch sheep population as well as on scrapie occurrence in this population. We show that the time needed for obtaining scrapie control depends crucially on two parameters measuring sheep population structure: the between-flock heterogeneity in genotype frequencies, and the heterogeneity of mixing (contact rates) between sheep flocks. Estimating the first parameter from Dutch genetic survey data and assuming scenario values for the second one, enables model prediction of the time needed to achieve scrapie control in The Netherlands.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ad6de948</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas J.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become an important issue in the healthcare systems of both developed and developing countries. Phytoestrogens have shown estrogenic effects, which may involve in the etiology of MetS. The current study consisted of 293 MetS cases and 264 healthy controls. The concentrations of seven plasma phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, equol, enterolactone, enterodiol and coumestrol) were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the associations between plasma phytoestrogens concentration and risks of MetS, as well as the associations between plasma phytoestrogens concentration and MetS components. Linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between equol concentration in equol-producers and MetS components. Higher concentrations of total isoflavone and equol were associated with decreased risk of MetS. The equol concentration was negatively associated with waist circumference and positively associated with HDL-C level. Increased daidzein was associated with both lower waist circumference and lower fasting blood glucose levels. Our results suggested that higher plasma total isoflavone, equol and daidzein might decrease MetS risk.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>40765f5b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jie Liu, Shengquan Mi, Li Du, Xiang Li, Peiqin Li, Keyu Jia, Jing Zhao, Hong Zhang, Wenhua Zhao, Ying Gao&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 (-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651). For every willingness-to-pay threshold, the incremental net monetary benefits did not significantly differ from zero.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The longer-term treatments were similar with regard to costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared to shorter-term treatment in patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms after one year of follow-up. Given the results of this study, and taking into account the external costs associated with antibiotic resistance, the shorter-term treatment is the antibiotic regimen of first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fd66eebf</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anneleen Berende, Lisette Nieuwenhuis, Hadewych J.

Given the results of this study, and taking into account the external costs associated with antibiotic resistance, the shorter-term treatment is the antibiotic regimen of first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195260</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195260</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Cost-effectiveness of longer-term versus shorter-term provision of antibiotics in patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><published>1522702800000</published><author><name>Anneleen Berende</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195260</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195260</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76932:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species, Published online: 02 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4096&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4096&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A new computational approach enables integrative analysis of disparate single-cell RNA–sequencing data sets by identifying shared patterns of variation between cell subpopulations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c08b44d6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species, Published online: 02 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4096&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4096&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A new computational approach enables integrative analysis of disparate single-cell RNA–sequencing data sets by identifying shared patterns of variation between cell subpopulations.</description><crawled>1522681774513</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4096</href></item></alternate><engagement>8</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4096</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522652400000</published><author><name>Andrew Butler</name></author><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4096</originId><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nbt.4096-F1.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>508</height><width>685</width></visual><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_16286e801b1:8b99f2c:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Designable ultra-smooth ultra-thin solid-electrolyte interphases of three alkali metal anodes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designable ultra-smooth ultra-thin solid-electrolyte interphases of three alkali metal anodes, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03466-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03466-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The dendrite growth of alkali metal anodes leads to charge/discharge cycling instability.

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hb&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA or protein. Instead, we find that Pum and Nos control the accumulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in testes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>cd12af8a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tammy H.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV is vulnerable to unplanned treatment interruptions–consecutively missed doses over a series of days–which can result in virologic rebound. Yet clinicians lack a simple, valid method for estimating the risk of interruptions. If the likelihood of ART interruption could be derived from a convenient-to-gather summary measure of medication adherence, it might be a valuable tool for both clinical decision-making and research. We constructed an &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; probability model of ART interruption based on average adherence and tested its predictions using data collected on 185 HIV-infected, treatment-naïve individuals over the first 90 days of ART in a prospective cohort study in Mbarara, Uganda. The outcome of interest was the presence or absence of a treatment gap, defined as &gt;72 hours without a dose. Using the pre-determined value of 0.50 probability as the cut point for predicting an interruption, the classification accuracy of the model was 73% (95% CI = 66%– 79%), the specificity was 87% (95% CI = 79%– 93%), and the sensitivity was 59% (95% CI = 48%– 69%). Overall model performance was satisfactory, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.80–0.91) and Brier score of 0.20. The study serves as proof-of-concept that the probability model can accurately differentiate patients on the continuum of risk for short-term ART interruptions using a summary measure of adherence. The model may also aid in the design of targeted interventions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fbd3cb51</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Arden Harris, Jessica E.

Overall model performance was satisfactory, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.80–0.91) and Brier score of 0.20. The study serves as proof-of-concept that the probability model can accurately differentiate patients on the continuum of risk for short-term ART interruptions using a summary measure of adherence. The model may also aid in the design of targeted interventions.</description><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194713</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194713</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Predicting short-term interruptions of antiretroviral therapy from summary adherence data: Development and test of a probability model</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><published>1521752400000</published><author><name>Rebecca Arden Harris</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194713</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194713</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34ab:34f43e70</id></item><item><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Chemical cross-linking/Mass Spectrometry (XLMS) is an experimental method to obtain distance constraints between amino acid residues, which can be applied to structural modeling of tertiary and quaternary biomolecular structures.

Transcription as the key step in gene expression is a highly regulated process. The speed of transcription elongation depends on the underlying gene sequence and varies on a gene by gene basis. The reason for this sequence dependence is not known in detail. Recently, our group studied the cross talk between the nascent RNA and the transcribing RNA polymerase by screening the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genome for RNA sequences with high affinity to RNA Pol by performing genomic SELEX. This approach led to the identification of RNA polymerase-binding APtamers termed “RAPs”. RAPs can have positive and negative effects on gene expression. A subgroup is able to downregulate transcription via the activity of the termination factor Rho. In this study, we used a similar SELEX setup using yeast genomic DNA as source of RNA sequences and highly purified yeast RNA Pol II as bait and obtained almost 1300 yeast-derived RAPs. Yeast RAPs are found throughout the genome within genes and antisense to genes, they are overrepresented in the non-transcribed strand of yeast telomeres and underrepresented in intergenic regions. Genes harbouring a RAP are more likely to show lower mRNA levels. By determining the endogenous expression levels as well as using a reporter system, we show that RAPs located within coding regions can reduce the transcript level downstream of the RAP. Here we demonstrate that RAPs represent a novel type of regulatory RNA signal in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; that act in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and interfere with the elongating transcription machinery to reduce the transcriptional output.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a37b0dbb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Klopf, Murielle Moes, Fabian Amman, Bob Zimmermann, Frederike von Pelchrzim, Christina Wagner, Renée Schroeder&lt;/p&gt;

Here we demonstrate that RAPs represent a novel type of regulatory RNA signal in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; that act in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and interfere with the elongating transcription machinery to reduce the transcriptional output.</description><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Nascent RNA signaling to yeast RNA Pol II during transcription elongation</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><published>1521838800000</published><author><name>Eva Klopf</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c7:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Correlations between gut microbiota community structures of Tibetans and geography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Correlations between gut microbiota community structures of Tibetans and geography, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23386-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23386-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Correlations between gut microbiota community structures of Tibetans and geography&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ou3sbhdJ3lI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f7fb53ce</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Correlations between gut microbiota community structures of Tibetans and geography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Correlations between gut microbiota community structures of Tibetans and geography, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23386-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23386-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Correlations between gut microbiota community structures of Tibetans and geography&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ou3sbhdJ3lI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1521447575413</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/ou3sbhdJ3lI/s41598-018-23386-3</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23386-3</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Author Correction: Correlations between gut microbiota community structures of Tibetans and geography</title><unread>False</unread><published>1521442800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23386-3</href></item></canonical><author><name>Daoliang Lan</name></author><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23386-3</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1623d579f75:24a07a6:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>Motivation: Although Secondary Structure Predictors have been developed for more than 60 years, current ab initio methods have still some way to go to reach their theoretical limits.

Background &lt;p&gt;Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) can reduce under-5 morbidity and mortality in low-income settings. A program to strengthen IMCI practices through Mentorship and Enhanced Supervision at Health centers (MESH) was implemented in two rural districts in eastern Rwanda in 2010.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We estimated cost per improvement in quality of care as measured by the difference in correct diagnosis and correct treatment at baseline and 12 months of MESH. Costs of developing and implementing MESH were estimated in 2011 United States Dollars (USD) from the provider perspective using both top-down and bottom-up approaches, from programmatic financial records and site-level data. Improvement in quality of care attributed to MESH was measured through case management observations (n = 292 cases at baseline, 413 cases at 12 months), with outcomes from the intervention already published. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty under different assumptions of quality of care and patient volume.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The total annual cost of MESH was US$ 27,955.74 and the average cost added by MESH per IMCI patient was US$1.06. Salary and benefits accounted for the majority of total annual costs (US$22,400 /year). Improvements in quality of care after 12 months of MESH implementation cost US$2.95 per additional child correctly diagnosed and $5.30 per additional child correctly treated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incremental costs per additional child correctly diagnosed and child correctly treated suggest that MESH could be an affordable method for improving IMCI quality of care elsewhere in Rwanda and similar settings. Integrating MESH into existing supervision systems would further reduce costs, increasing potential for spread.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3ecc9f82</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anatole Manzi, Jean Claude Mugunga, Hari S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in some patients who achieve sustained virological response (SVR) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection via anti-HCV therapy. To examine the pathogenesis of HCC development after HCV eradication, histopathological changes and clinical markers were evaluated in SVR patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Of 654 SVR patients treated with interferon (IFN)-based therapies, 34 patients who had undergone liver biopsy before initiating IFN therapy and after SVR achievement were enrolled: 11 patients with HCC and 23 patients without HCC (male/female, 9/2 and 8/15, respectively: age, 58 ± 5 and 54 ± 11 years, respectively). We compared the clinical and histopathological factors between the two groups. Immunohistochemistry for Cytoglobin (CYGB) and α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was also performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At baseline, prior to initiating the IFN-based therapy, there were significant differences between the SVR-non-HCC and SVR-HCC groups in the male gender, HBc antibody positivity, prothrombin activity, and histological inflammatory grade. Histopathological evaluation, using the new Inuyama classification system, revealed an improvement in the inflammatory grade, from 2.1 ± 0.6 to 1.0 ± 0.6 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), whereas the fibrosis stage remained unchanged, from 2.3 ± 0.9 to 2.0 ± 1.2 (p = 0.2749), during the 97 ± 72-month observation period in the SVR-HCC group. Both the grade and stage scores were significantly improved in the SVR-non-HCC group. The area of collagen deposition, evaluated using Sirius red staining, showed a marked decrease, from 18.6 ± 7.6% to 7.7 ± 4.6%, in the SVR-non-HCC group, with no change in the SVR-HCC group. CYGB- and α-SMA-positive hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), indicative of the HSC activated phenotype, remained in the fibrotic tissue of livers among patients in the SVR-HCC group.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stagnation of fibrosis regression is associated with a high risk for HCC after SVR.

&lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia chaffeensis&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, secretes several effector proteins that bind host DNA to modulate host gene expression. The tandem repeat protein 120 (TRP120), one of the largest effector proteins, has four nearly identical tandem repeat (TR) regions that each consists of 80 amino acids. In addition to playing a role in ehrlichial binding and internalization, TRP120 translocates to the host nucleus where it is thought to function as a transcription factor that modulates gene expression. However, sequence analysis of TRP120 does not identify the presence of DNA-binding or trans-activation domains typical of classical eukaryotic transcription factors. Thus, the mechanism by which TRP120 binds DNA and modulates gene expression remains elusive. Herein, we expressed the TR regions of the TRP120 protein, and characterized its solution structure and ability to bind DNA. TRP120, expressed as either a one or two TR repeat, is a monomer in solution, and is mostly disordered as determined by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Using NMR spectroscopy, we further show that the 1 TR construct selectively binds GC-rich DNA. Although low pH was required for TRP120 TR-DNA interaction, acidic pH alone does not induce any significant structural changes in the TR region. This suggests that TRP120 folds into an ordered structure upon forming a protein-DNA complex, and thus folding of TRP120 TR is coupled with DNA binding.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e8729ac</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Valerie J.

The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is becoming the method of choice for expression of many eukaryotic proteins and protein complexes for biochemical, structural and pharmaceutical studies. Significant technological advancement has made generation of recombinant baculoviruses easy, efficient and user-friendly. However, there is a tremendous variability in the amount of proteins made using the BEVS, including different batches of virus made to express the same proteins. Yet, what influences the overall production of proteins or protein complexes remains largely unclear. Many downstream applications, particularly protein structure determination, require purification of large quantities of proteins in a repetitive manner, calling for a reliable experimental set-up to obtain proteins or protein complexes of interest consistently. During our investigation of optimizing the expression of the Mediator Head module, we discovered that the ‘initial infectivity’ was an excellent indicator of overall production of protein complexes. Further, we show that this initial infectivity can be mathematically described as a function of multiplicity of infection (MOI), correlating recombinant protein yield and virus titer. All these findings led us to develop the Titer Estimation for Quality Control (TEQC) method, which enables researchers to estimate initial infectivity, titer/MOI values in a simple and affordable way, and to use these values to quantitatively optimize protein expressions utilizing BEVS in a highly reproducible fashion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e3336989</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsuyoshi Imasaki, Sabine Wenzel, Kentaro Yamada, Megan L.

Thyroid hormone (TH) orchestrates amphibian metamorphosis. Thus, this developmental phase is often used to study TH-dependent responses in specific tissues. However, TH signaling appears early in development raising the question of the control of TH availability in specific cell types prior to metamorphosis. TH availability is under strict temporal and tissue-specific control by deiodinases. We examined the expression of the TH-inactivating enzyme, deiodinase type 3 (D3), during early retinal development. To this end we created a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; transgenic line expressing GFP from the Xenopus &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter region (p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;) and followed p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;–GFP expression in pre-metamorphic tadpoles. To validate retinal GFP expression in the transgenic line as a function of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity, we used &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to compare endogenous &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression to reporter-driven GFP activity. Retinal expression of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; increased during pre-metamorphosis through stages NF41, 45 and 48. Both sets of results show &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; to have cell-specific, dynamic expression in the pre-metamorphic retina. At stage NF48, &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression co-localised with markers for photoreceptors, rods, Opsin-S cones and bipolar neurons. In contrast, in post-metamorphic juveniles &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression was reduced and spatially confined to certain photoreceptors and amacrine cells. We compared &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression at stages NF41 and NF48 with TH-dependent transcriptional responses using another transgenic reporter line: &lt;i&gt;THbZIP&lt;/i&gt;-GFP and by analyzing the expression of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-regulated genes in distinct TH availability contexts. At stage NF48, the majority of retinal cells expressing &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; were negative for T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signaling. Notably, most ganglion cells were virtually both &lt;i&gt;dio3-&lt;/i&gt;free and T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-responsive. The results show that &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; can reduce TH availability at the cellular scale. Further, a reduction in &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression can trigger fine-tuned T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; action in cell-type specific maturation at the right time, as exemplified here in photoreceptor survival in the pre-metamorphic retina.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>dff9ba9d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karine Le Blay, Laëtitia Préau, Ghislaine Morvan-Dubois, Barbara Demeneix&lt;/p&gt;

Analyzing extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an attractive approach to diagnosis of prostate diagnosis. However, existing methods of EVs isolation have low efficiency, purity, and long process time, and therefore have low diagnostic ability. To solve these the problems, a two-phase system is adapted to isolate EVs from a patient’s urine. Urine from 20 prostate cancer (PCA) patients and 10 benign prostate hyperplasia patients was used to quantify the EVs-isolation ability of an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) and to compare the diagnostic ability of ATPS with that of the conventional diagnosis method. An optimized ATPS isolates EVs with ~100% efficiency within ~30 min, with 14 times as high as achieved by ultracentrifugation. Afterward, PCR and ELISA are used to detect EVs derived from PCA cells in urine. The results demonstrate that diagnostic ability based on ATPS is better than other conventional diagnostic methods. ATPS can obtain a high quality and quantity of EVs from patients’ urine. EVs contain cancer-related protein and genes, so these abundant sources enable diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, ATPS is a useful tool to increase the specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>43d40a2f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunwoo Shin, Yong Hyun Park, Yong-Goo Kim, Ji Youl Lee, Jaesung Park&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Individuals with metabolic syndrome have increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to test the hypothesis that a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CR-fitness), counteracts accumulation of visceral fat, decreases inflammation and lowers risk factors of the metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;The study sample included 1,293 Danes (age 49–52 years) who from 2009 to 2011 participated in the Copenhagen Aging and Midlife Biobank, including a questionnaire, physical tests, and blood samples. Multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and plasma levels of cytokines and high sensitive C-reactive protein as outcomes and measures of abdominal obesity were added to test if they explained the potential association. Similarly, multiple linear regression models were performed with CR-fitness as exposure and factors of the metabolic syndrome as outcomes and the potential explanation by inflammatory biomarkers were tested. All models were adjusted for the effect of age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, socio-economic status, and acute inflammatory events within the preceding two weeks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;CR-fitness was inversely associated with high sensitive C-reactive protein, Interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-18, and directly associated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma or IL-1β. Abdominal obesity could partly explain the significant associations. Moreover, CR-fitness was inversely associated with an overall metabolic syndrome score, as well as triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin A&lt;sub&gt;1c&lt;/sub&gt;, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and directly associated with high-density lipoprotein. Single inflammatory biomarkers and a combined inflammatory score partly explained these associations.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Data suggest that CR-fitness has anti-inflammatory effects that are partly explained by a reduction in abdominal obesity and a decrease in the metabolic syndrome risk profile. The overall inflammatory load was mainly driven by high sensitive C-reactive protein and IL-6.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>891b71d8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne-Sophie Wedell-Neergaard, Rikke Krogh-Madsen, Gitte Lindved Petersen, Åse Marie Hansen, Bente Klarlund Pedersen, Rikke Lund, Helle Bruunsgaard&lt;/p&gt;

The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt; (Wiedemann), is a key pest of fruit crops in many tropical, subtropical and mild temperate areas worldwide. The economic importance of this fruit fly is increasing due to its invasion of new geographical areas. Efficient control and eradication efforts require adequate information regarding &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; adults in relation to environmental and physiological cues. This would allow effective characterisation of the population spatio-temporal dynamic of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; population at both the orchard level and the area-wide landscape.
The aim of this study was to analyse population patterns of adult medflies caught using two trapping systems in a peach orchard located in central Italy. They were differentiated by adult sex (males or females) and mating status of females (unmated or mated females) to determine the spatio-temporal dynamic and evaluate the effect of cultivar and chemical treatments on trap catches. Female mating status was assessed by spermathecal dissection and a blind test was carried out to evaluate the reliability of the technique. Geostatistical methods, variogram and kriging, were used to produce distributional maps. Results showed a strong correlation between the distribution of males and unmated females, whereas males versus mated females and unmated females versus mated females showed a lower correlation. Both cultivar and chemical treatments had significant effects on trap catches, showing associations with sex and female mating status. Medfly adults showed aggregated distributions in the experimental field, but hot spots locations varied. The spatial pattern of unmated females reflected that of males, whereas mated females were largely distributed around ripening or ripe fruit. The results give relevant insights into pest management. Mated females may be distributed differently to unmated females and the identification of male hot spots through monitoring would allow localisation of virgin female populations. Based on our results, a more precise IPM strategy, coupled with effective sanitation practices, could represent a more effective approach to medfly control.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9bff587c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Sciarretta, Maria Rosaria Tabilio, Elena Lampazzi, Claudio Ceccaroli, Marco Colacci, Pasquale Trematerra&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different types of bone conduction transducers with different physical and electro-acoustic properties are available for audiometric hearing threshold measurements.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different types of bone conduction transducers with different physical and electro-acoustic properties are available for audiometric hearing threshold measurements.

Autophagy plays a crucial role in health and disease, regulating central cellular processes such as adaptive stress responses, differentiation, tissue development, and homeostasis. However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti–hair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VVncDRle7Ww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Parodi, Jonathan A.

The immunological profiles of human specific IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) vary by genetic predisposition, living conditions in different geographical locations and patient’s age. The aim of our study was to analyze sIgE and sIgG4 patterns and their age-dependent changes in patients from the Moscow region. For identifying sIgE and sIgG4 profiles the blood samples from 513 patients aged 6 months to 17 years who were showing symptoms of allergic diseases were analyzed using microarrays containing 31 allergens. The highest sIgE prevalence was observed for birch pollen (32%) among pollen allergens, cat dander (24%) among indoor allergens, and egg whites (21%) among food allergens. The most common sIgG4 response was developed toward egg whites (80% of patients). Age-related elevation was identified for patients with increased sIgE to pollen allergens and indoor allergens (cat or dog dander and house dust mites). For each allergen, the proportion of cases with significant levels of sIgG4 appeared to increase with patients’ age. The data on allergen-specific sIgE and sIgG4 prevalence show both general trends and some local special aspects that are indicative for the Moscow region.

The aim of our study was to analyze sIgE and sIgG4 patterns and their age-dependent changes in patients from the Moscow region. For identifying sIgE and sIgG4 profiles the blood samples from 513 patients aged 6 months to 17 years who were showing symptoms of allergic diseases were analyzed using microarrays containing 31 allergens. The highest sIgE prevalence was observed for birch pollen (32%) among pollen allergens, cat dander (24%) among indoor allergens, and egg whites (21%) among food allergens. The most common sIgG4 response was developed toward egg whites (80% of patients). Age-related elevation was identified for patients with increased sIgE to pollen allergens and indoor allergens (cat or dog dander and house dust mites). For each allergen, the proportion of cases with significant levels of sIgG4 appeared to increase with patients’ age. The data on allergen-specific sIgE and sIgG4 prevalence show both general trends and some local special aspects that are indicative for the Moscow region. This information should be useful in terms of epidemiology of allergic diseases.</description><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194775</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194775</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Patterns of sensitization to inhalant and food allergens among pediatric patients from the Moscow region (Russian Federation)</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><published>1521752400000</published><author><name>Sergei Voloshin</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194775</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194775</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b2:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt;) is a Gram-negative bacterium that grows symbiotically with various edible plants, and the oral or sublingual administration of lipopolysaccharide derived from &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agglomerans&lt;/i&gt; (LPSp) have been suggested to contribute to prevention of immune-related diseases. Our previous study indicated that orally administered LPSp was shown to exhibit an LDL-lowering effect in hyperlipidemic volunteers; however, a preventive effect of LPSp on atherosclerosis is unclear. The present study attempted to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic effect by LPSp in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. For 16 weeks, apoE-deficient mice were fed an HFD and received drinking water containing LPSp (0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight/day). The results showed that the orally administered LPSp decreased body weight. A significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque deposition was observed even with the lower dose of LPSp. The biochemical analyses showed that LPSp markedly improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma LDL and oxidized LDL levels. In addition, LPSp significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators including MCP-1 (in the plasma), TNF-α and IL-6 (in the colon), and decreased the oxidative burst activities in the peripheral blood sample. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that oral administration of LPSp can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative responses to prevent atherosclerosis and related metabolic disorders.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9848fbe4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;

Bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) is one experimental model of vascular dementia thought to preferentially impact brain white matter. Indeed, few studies report hippocampal and cortical pathology prior to 30 days post-stenosis; though it is unclear whether those studies examined regions outside the white matter. Since changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability precede more overt brain pathology in various diseases, we hypothesized that changes within the BBB and/or BBB-associated extracellular matrix (ECM) could occur earlier after BCAS in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum and be a precursor of longer term pathology. Here, C57Bl/6 mice underwent BCAS or sham surgeries and changes in the BBB and ECM were analyzed by collagen IV (vascular basement membrane component), α5 integrin (marker of endothelial activation), claudin-5 and occludin (tight junction proteins), Evans blue (permeability marker), Ki-67 (cell proliferation marker), and GFAP and CD11b (glial cell markers) immunohistochemistry after 14 days. Significant changes in markers of cerebrovascular integrity and glial activation were detected, not only in the striatum, but also in the hippocampus and cortex. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that changes in the BBB/ECM occur shortly after BCAS and within multiple brain regions and suggests such changes might underlie the gradual development of BCAS non-white matter pathology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a5fc01f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jill M.

The modulatory role of the primary motor cortex (M1), reflected by an inhibitory effect of M1-stimulation on clinical pain, motivated us to deepen our understanding of M1’s role in pain modulation. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced virtual lesion (VL) to interrupt with M1 activity during noxious heat pain. We hypothesized that TMS-VL will effect experimental pain ratings. Three VL protocols were applied consisting of single-pulse TMS to transiently interfere with right M1 activity: (1) VL&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt;- TMS applied to 11 subjects, 20 msec before the individual’s first pain-related M1 peak activation, as determined by source analysis (sLORETA), (2) VL&lt;sub&gt;-50&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 50 ms prior to noxious stimulus onset), and (3) VL&lt;sub&gt;+150&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 150 ms after noxious stimulus onset). Each protocol included 3 conditions (&apos;pain-alone&apos;, &apos; TMS-VL&apos;, and ‘SHAM-VL’), each consisted of 30 noxious heat stimuli. Pain ratings were compared, in each protocol, for TMS-VL vs. SHAM-VL and vs. pain-alone conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance, corrected for multiple comparisons revealed no significant differences in the pain ratings between the different conditions within each protocol. Therefore, our results from this exploratory study suggest that a single pulse TMS-induced VL that is targeted to M1 failed to interrupt experimental pain processing in the specific three stimulation timing examined here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>228e14c4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lee-Bareket Kisler, Ilan Gurion, Yelena Granovsky, Alon Sinai, Elliot Sprecher, Simone Shamay-Tsoory, Irit Weissman-Fogel&lt;/p&gt;

Our study addresses how environmental variables, such as macronutrients concentrations, snow cover, carbonate chemistry and salinity affect the photophysiology and biomass of Antarctic sea-ice algae. We have measured vertical profiles of inorganic macronutrients (phosphate, nitrite + nitrate and silicic acid) in summer sea ice and photophysiology of ice algal assemblages in the poorly studied Amundsen and Ross Seas sectors of the Southern Ocean. Brine-scaled bacterial abundance, chl &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and macronutrient concentrations were often high in the ice and positively correlated with each other. Analysis of photosystem II rapid light curves showed that microalgal cells in samples with high phosphate and nitrite + nitrate concentrations had reduced maximum relative electron transport rate and photosynthetic efficiency. We also observed strong couplings of PSII parameters to snow depth, ice thickness and brine salinity, which highlights a wide range of photoacclimation in Antarctic pack-ice algae. It is likely that the pack ice was in a post-bloom situation during the late sea-ice season, with low photosynthetic efficiency and a high degree of nutrient accumulation occurring in the ice. In order to predict how key biogeochemical processes are affected by future changes in sea ice cover, such as &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; photosynthesis and nutrient cycling, we need to understand how physicochemical properties of sea ice affect the microbial community. Our results support existing hypothesis about sea-ice algal photophysiology, and provide additional observations on high nutrient concentrations in sea ice that could influence the planktonic communities as the ice is retreating.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7b493645</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anders Torstensson, Agneta Fransson, Kim Currie, Angela Wulff, Melissa Chierici&lt;/p&gt;

Our results support existing hypothesis about sea-ice algal photophysiology, and provide additional observations on high nutrient concentrations in sea ice that could influence the planktonic communities as the ice is retreating.</description><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195587</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195587</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Microalgal photophysiology and macronutrient distribution in summer sea ice in the Amundsen and Ross Seas, Antarctica</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><published>1523394000000</published><author><name>Anders Torstensson</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195587</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195587</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b5:9aea0a7d</id></item><item><content><content>Cell fate decisions play a pivotal role in development but technologies for dissecting them are limited.

Given the frequency with which MAP kinase signaling is dysregulated in cancer, much effort has been focused on inhibiting RAS signaling for therapeutic benefit. KSR1, a pseudokinase that interacts with RAF, is a potential target; it was originally cloned in screens for suppressors of constitutively active RAS, and its deletion prevents RAS-mediated transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In this work, we used a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer to assess whether KSR1 deletion would influence tumor development in the setting of oncogenic RAS. We found that &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice on this background had a modest but significant improvement in all-cause morbidity compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; cohorts. &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, however, still developed tumors, and precursor pancreatic intraepithelial neoplastic (PanIN) lesions were detected within a similar timeframe compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice.

It seems that faba bean (FB) seeds could be a good protein-energy component in animal feed, but the presence of anti-nutritional substances limits their use as a substitute of soybean meal. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of different concentrations of raw, low-tannin, FB seeds on the gut-bone axis in Ross 308 broilers. One-day old chickens were randomly subjected to one of the 3 dietary treatments: the control group was fed standard diet based on soybean meal and without FB seeds, and two groups were fed 8%/15% and 16%/22% of raw low-tannin FB seeds in the starter and grower, respectively. On the 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, hematological and serum biochemical analyses as well histomorphometry of the small intestine and liver tissue and bone mechanical tests were performed. The diet type had no effect on the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. However, the basal intestinal structures were significantly reduced in birds fed the lower concentration of FB. The enlargement of nerve plexuses was dependent on the concentration used in the diet and, additionally, on the kind of plexus and location in the intestinal tract. The liver was characterized by an increase in non-hepatocytes. There was no influence of the low-tannin FB seeds on most of the analyzed serum parameters in the 35-day-old broiler chickens, except the decreased concentration of total cholesterol and Ca in both experimental groups, triglycerides in group I, and P and uric acid in group II. Furthermore, the increasing concentration of the dietary low-tannin FB did not influence the activities of AspAT (except the group fed the higher amount of FB), ALAT, and LDH. The broiler chickens had no visible leg lesions and no problem in the locomotor function, but the tibiae were lighter mainly in birds fed the higher concentration of FB seeds. Geometric analysis revealed reduction of the cross section area and wall thickness, indicating a decline in the bone midshaft, which influenced the densitometric parameters and the results of mechanical tests. In conclusion, the dietary inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seeds had no negative effects on broiler growth, but disturbed the intestine structure and tibia characteristics. Therefore, all these negative effects necessitate additional examinations before inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seed into poultry diet.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>cb1db6ad</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ewa Tomaszewska, Piotr Dobrowolski, Renata Klebaniuk, Małgorzata Kwiecień, Agnieszka Tomczyk-Warunek, Sylwia Szymańczyk, Sylwester Kowalik, Anna Milczarek, Tomasz Blicharski, Siemowit Muszyński&lt;/p&gt;

Periodic DFT calculations with atom‐centered Gaussian basis functions with the Turbomole program are used to calculate lattice energies for several non‐covalently bound organic molecular crystals. The accuracy and convergence of results with basis set size and k‐space sampling from periodic calculations is evaluated for the two reference molecules benzoic acid and naphthalene. For the X23 benchmark set of small molecular crystals accurate lattice energies are obtained using the PBE‐D3 functional. In particular for hydrogen‐bonded systems, a sufficiently large basis set is required.

Periodic DFT calculations with atom‐centered Gaussian basis functions with the Turbomole program are used to calculate lattice energies for several non‐covalently bound organic molecular crystals. The accuracy and convergence of results with basis set size and k‐space sampling from periodic calculations is evaluated for the two reference molecules benzoic acid and naphthalene. For the X23 benchmark set of small molecular crystals accurate lattice energies are obtained using the PBE‐D3 functional. In particular for hydrogen‐bonded systems, a sufficiently large basis set is required. The calculated lattice energy differences between enantiopure and racemic crystal forms for a prototype set of chiral molecules are in good agreement with experimental results and allow the rationalization and computer‐aided design of chiral separation processes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162956fcc6f:a3d99e4:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>Efforts to improve the reproducibility and integrity of science are typically justified by a narrative of crisis, according to which most published results are unreliable due to growing problems with research and publication practices.

Perceived time constraints have been highlighted in sociological studies as representing a core issue in determining quality of life. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that gender inequalities regarding insufficiency of time play a role in the development of overweight and obesity in adults. The study used baseline data (2008–2010) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), which monitors a cohort of 15,105 civil servants of 35 to 74 years of age. Insufficient time for personal care and leisure due to professional and domestic duties, as detailed in a structured questionnaire, comprised the main exposure variable. The outcome variable was overweight/obesity measured according to body mass index. Prevalence ratios were calculated using multinomial logistic regression. A greater proportion of women compared to men reported insufficient time for personal care and leisure (34.5% versus 23.8%, respectively). The prevalence of overweight was greater in men, while obesity was more common in women. Insufficient time for personal care and leisure was associated with overweight (PR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.04–1.61) and obesity (PR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.28–2.12) only in women working over 40 hours/week. No significant association was found for males. These results suggest that the length of the working week influences factors underlying weight gain, possibly issues linked to behavior and/or stress mechanisms. The fact that such an association was restricted to women suggests that the results originate from gender inequalities involving relationships between time and health. The findings of this study provide data on which to base public policies aimed at encouraging the redistribution of domestic responsibilities in the direction of gender equity, as well as macrosocial policies such as providing public schools for workers’ children.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>85f03dc5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karina Araujo Pinto, Rosane Harter Griep, Lucia Rotenberg, Maria da Conceição Chagas Almeida, Rosane Sousa Barreto, Estela M.

Overall, we believe that this distributed representation of genes may be useful for more bioinformatics applications.</description><crawled>1521728559521</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286096v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286096v1?rss=1</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Gene2Vec: Distributed Representation of Genes Based on Co-Expression [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>False</unread><published>1521702000000</published><author><name>Du, J.</name></author><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/22/286096</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286096v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1624e1719a1:3eb69a9:7d6c1c1c</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sakari Joenvaara, Mayank Saraswat, Pentti Kuusela, Shruti Saraswat, Rahul Agarwal, Johanna Kaartinen, Asko Järvinen, Risto Renkonen&lt;/p&gt;
Bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality with rates varying from 10–25% and higher. Appropriate and timely onset of antibiotic therapy influences the prognosis of these patients. It requires the diagnostic accuracy which is not afforded by current gold standards such as blood culture. Moreover, the time from blood sampling to blood culture results is a key determinant of reducing mortality. No established biomarkers exist which can differentiate bloodstream infections from other systemic inflammatory conditions. This calls for studies on biomarkers potential of molecular profiling of plasma as it is affected most by the molecular changes accompanying bloodstream infections. N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification which is very sensitive to changes in physiology. Here we have performed targeted quantitative N-glycoproteomics from plasma samples of patients with confirmed positive blood culture together with age and sex matched febrile controls with negative blood culture reports. Three hundred and sixty eight potential N-glycopeptides were quantified by mass spectrometry and 149 were further selected for identification. Twenty four N-glycopeptides were identified with high confidence together with elucidation of the peptide sequence, N-glycosylation site, glycan composition and proposed glycan structures. Principal component analysis, orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (S-Plot) and self-organizing maps clustering among other statistical methods were employed to analyze the data. These methods gave us clear separation of the two patient classes. We propose high-confidence N-glycopeptides which have the power to separate the bloodstream infections from blood culture negative febrile patients and shed light on host response during bacteremia. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD009048.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1416d9ae</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sakari Joenvaara, Mayank Saraswat, Pentti Kuusela, Shruti Saraswat, Rahul Agarwal, Johanna Kaartinen, Asko Järvinen, Risto Renkonen&lt;/p&gt;

The growing area of European hazelnut (&lt;i&gt;Corylus avellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is increasing, as well as the number of producing countries, and there is a pressing need for new improved cultivars. Hazelnut conventional breeding process is slow, due to the length of juvenile phase and the high heterozygosity level. The development of genetic linkage maps and the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to QTL (quantitative trait loci) of agronomic interest are essential tools for speeding up the selection of seedlings carrying desired traits through marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to enrich a previous linkage map and confirm QTL related to time of leaf budburst, using an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; population obtained by crossing Tonda Gentile delle Langhe with Merveille de Bollwiller. Genotyping-by-Sequencing was used to identify a total of 9,999 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Well saturated linkage maps were constructed for each parent using the double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. A reciprocal translocation was detected in Tonda Gentile delle Langhe between two non-homologous chromosomes. Applying a bioinformatic approach, we were able to disentangle ‘pseudo-linkage’ between markers, removing markers around the translocation breakpoints and obtain a linear order of the markers for the two chromosomes arms, for each linkage group involved in the translocation. Twenty-nine QTL for time of leaf budburst were identified, including a stably expressed region on LG_02 of the Tonda Gentile delle Langhe map. The stability of these QTL and their coding sequence content indicates promise for the identification of specific chromosomal regions carrying key genes involved in leaf budburst.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>809ef603</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Torello Marinoni, Nadia Valentini, Ezio Portis, Alberto Acquadro, Chiara Beltramo, Shawn A.

In skeletal muscle the coordinated actions of two mechanically coupled Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels—the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1) and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1)–underlie the molecular mechanism of rapid cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] increase leading to contraction. While both [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and contractile activity have been implicated in the regulation of myogenesis, less is known about potential specific roles of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 and RYR1 in skeletal muscle development. In this study, we analyzed the histology and the transcriptomic changes occurring at E14.5 –the end of primary myogenesis and around the onset of intrauterine limb movement, and at E18.5 –the end of secondary myogenesis, in WT, RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; murine limb skeletal muscle. At E14.5 the muscle histology of both mutants exhibited initial alterations, which became much more severe at E18.5. Immunohistological analysis also revealed higher levels of activated caspase-3 in the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; muscles at E14.5, indicating an increase in apoptosis. With WT littermates as controls, microarray analyses identified 61 and 97 differentially regulated genes (DEGs) at E14.5, and 493 and 1047 DEGs at E18.5, in RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; samples, respectively. Gene enrichment analysis detected no overlap in the affected biological processes and pathways in the two mutants at E14.5, whereas at E18.5 there was a significant overlap of DEGs in both mutants, affecting predominantly processes linked to muscle contraction. Moreover, the E18.5 vs. E14.5 comparison revealed multiple genotype-specific DEGs involved in contraction, cell cycle and miRNA-mediated signaling in WT, neuronal and bone development in RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;, and lipid metabolism in Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; samples. Taken together, our study reveals discrete changes in the global transcriptome occurring in limb skeletal muscle from E14.5 to E18.5 in WT, RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice.

Our results suggest distinct functional roles for RYR1 and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 in skeletal primary and secondary myogenesis.</description><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194428</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194428</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Distinct transcriptomic changes in E14.5 mouse skeletal muscle lacking RYR1 or Ca&amp;lt;sub&gt;v&amp;lt;/sub&gt;1.1 converge at E18.5</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><published>1521147600000</published><author><name>Dilyana Filipova</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194428</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194428</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a61d:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ting-ting Ni, Ying Zhou, An-cui Yong, Lu Wang, Qing-he Zhou&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;In parturients with increased physiologically intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and a short stature, a greater cephalad spread of spinal anesthesia is often observed after a fixed amount of plain bupivacaine is administered. Therefore, we designed this prospective study to test whether IAP and vertebral column length (VCL) were predictors of spinal spread in parturients undergoing a cesarean section.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 113 parturients, all undergoing elective cesarean sections with single-shot spinal anesthesia, were enrolled. The L3-L4 interspace was entered, and 2 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space. Upon loss of temperature sensation at the T4 level, IAP was measured through a bladder catheter while the patient was in the supine position with a 10°left lateral tilt. Parturient demographic variables, including age, height, weight, IAP, and VCL were recorded. Linear regressions and multiple regressions were performed to analyze the relationships between parturient variables and the spread of spinal anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 109 parturients were included in the analysis. Linear regression analysis showed a significant univariate correlation of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), IAP, and VCL with cephalad spread (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.004). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that IAP and VCL were the key determinants of spinal spread (both &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), where as exclusion of age, weight, and height did not change the result (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt; 0.209).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that IAP and VCL were significant predictors of intrathecal spread of plain bupivacaine, and there was a positive association between IAP and abdominal girth in term parturients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e2e14759</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ting-ting Ni, Ying Zhou, An-cui Yong, Lu Wang, Qing-he Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

The prevalence of stunting among children below 5 years of age is higher in the slum-dwelling population of Bangladesh compared to that in both urban and rural areas. Studies have reported that several factors such as inadequate nutrition, low socio-economic status, poor hygiene and sanitation and lack of maternal education are the substantial predictors of childhood stunting. Almost all these factors are universally present in the slum-dwelling population of Bangladesh. However, few studies have prospectively examined such determinants of stunting among slum populations. In this paper, we reveal the findings of a cohort study with an aim to explore the status of micronutrient adequacy among such vulnerable children and establish its association with stunting along with other determinants. Two-hundred-sixty-five children were enrolled and followed since birth until 24 months of age. We collected anthropometric, morbidity and dietary intake data monthly. We used the 24-hour multiple-pass recall approach to collect dietary intake data from the age of 9 months onward. Micronutrient adequacy of the diet was determined by the mean adequacy ratio (MAR) which was constructed from the average intake of 9 vitamins and 4 minerals considered for the analysis. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models to establish the determinants of stunting between 12–24 months of age in our study population. The prevalence of low-birth-weight (LBW) was about 28.7% and approximately half of the children were stunted by the age of 24 months. The average micronutrient intake was considerably lower than the recommended dietary allowance and the MAR was only 0.48 at 24 months of age compared to the optimum value of 1. However, the MAR was not associated with stunting between 12–24 months of age. Rather, LBW was the significant determinant (AOR = 3.03, 95% CI: 1.69–5.44) after adjusting for other factors such as age (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.45–3.11 at 24 months and AOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.49–2.59 at 18 months, ref: 12 months) and sex (AOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.17–3.33, ref: female). Improving the nutritional quality of complementary food in terms of adequacy of micronutrients is imperative for optimum growth but may not be adequate to mitigate under-nutrition in this setting. Further research should focus on identifying multiple strategies that can work synergistically to diminish the burden of stunting in resource-poor settings.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>459b9215</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazi Istiaque Sanin, M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine during short-term treatment in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a comprehensive literature review of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials databases for randomized controlled trials(RCTs) comparing duloxetine or duloxetine plus other antipsychotics with placebo for the treatment of GAD in adults. Outcome measures were (1) efficacy, assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) anxiety subscale score, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety(HAM-A) psychic and somatic anxiety factor scores, and response and remission rates based on total scores of HAM-A; (2) tolerability, assessed by discontinuation rate due to adverse events, the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events(TEAEs) and serious adverse events(SAEs). Review Manager 5.3 and Stata Version 12.0 software were used for all statistical analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis included 8 RCTs. Mean changes in the HADS anxiety subscale score [mean difference(MD) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval(CI) 1.77–2.88, P&amp;lt;0.00001] and HAM-A psychic anxiety factor score were significantly greater in patients with GAD that received duloxetine compared to those that received placebo (MD = 2.15, 95%CI 1.61–2.68, P&amp;lt;0.00001). However, there was no difference in mean change in the HAM-A somatic anxiety factor score (MD = 1.13, 95%CI 0.67–1.58, P&amp;lt;0.00001). Discontinuation rate due to AEs in the duloxetine group was significantly higher than the placebo group [odds ratio(OR) = 2.62, 95%CI 1.35–5.06, P = 0.004]. The incidence of any TEAE was significantly increased in patients that received duloxetine (OR = 1.76, 95%CI 1.36–2.28, P&amp;lt;0.0001), but there was no significant difference in the incidence of SAEs (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 0.52–2.47, P = 0.75).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Duloxetine resulted in a greater improvement in symptoms of psychic anxiety and similar changes in symptoms of somatic anxiety compared to placebo during short-term treatment in adults with GAD and its tolerability was acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b54c3670</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xinyuan Li, Lijun Zhu, Chunkui Zhou, Jing Liu, Heqian Du, Chenglin Wang, Shaokuan Fang&lt;/p&gt;

The incidence of any TEAE was significantly increased in patients that received duloxetine (OR = 1.76, 95%CI 1.36–2.28, P&amp;lt;0.0001), but there was no significant difference in the incidence of SAEs (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 0.52–2.47, P = 0.75).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Duloxetine resulted in a greater improvement in symptoms of psychic anxiety and similar changes in symptoms of somatic anxiety compared to placebo during short-term treatment in adults with GAD and its tolerability was acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194501</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194501</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Efficacy and tolerability of short-term duloxetine treatment in adults with generalized anxiety disorder: A meta-analysis</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><published>1521579600000</published><author><name>Xinyuan Li</name></author><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194501</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194501</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37ad:9f3b30f2</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aspm&lt;/i&gt; knockout ferret reveals an evolutionary mechanism governing cerebral cortical size&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;Aspm&amp;lt;/i&gt; knockout ferret reveals an evolutionary mechanism governing cerebral cortical size, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0035-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0035-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In a ferret model, the microcephaly-associated gene Aspm regulates cortical expansion by controlling the transition of ventricular radial glial cells to more differentiated cell types.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>667500e9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aspm&lt;/i&gt; knockout ferret reveals an evolutionary mechanism governing cerebral cortical size&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;Aspm&amp;lt;/i&gt; knockout ferret reveals an evolutionary mechanism governing cerebral cortical size, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0035-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0035-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In a ferret model, the microcephaly-associated gene Aspm regulates cortical expansion by controlling the transition of ventricular radial glial cells to more differentiated cell types.</description><crawled>1523466919412</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0035-0</href></item></alternate><engagement>192</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0035-0</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Aspm knockout ferret reveals an evolutionary mechanism governing cerebral cortical size</title><unread>True</unread><published>1523430000000</published><author><name>Matthew B.

Objective &lt;p&gt;As genomic research gathers momentum in sub-Saharan Africa, it has become increasingly important to understand the reasons why individuals wish to participate in this kind of medical research. Against the background of communitarianism conceived as typical of African communities, it is often suggested that individuals consent to participate on the grounds of solidarity and to further the common good. In this paper, we seek to explore this contention by presenting data from focus groups with potential research participants about what would influence their decisions to participate in genomic research.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;These focus groups were conducted as part of a larger qualitative study with a purposively selected group of participants from a community situated in south west Nigeria. We conducted fifteen focus group sessions comprising 50 participants organized by age and sex, namely: 1) adult (&gt;30 years) males, 2) adult females, 3) youth (18–30 years) males, and 4) youth females. A mixed age-group was conducted to probe different views between the age groups. There was discordance and clear division between the adults and youths regarding the decision to participate in genomic research based on commitment to communal values. Adults based their decision to participate on altruism and furthering the common good while youths based their decisions on personal benefits and preferences and also took into account the views and welfare of family members and neighbours.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This discordance suggests a ‘generational shift’ and we advance a model of ‘relative solidarity’ among the youths, which is different from the communal solidarity model typical of African communitarianism. Our findings suggest the need for a closer look at strategies for implementation of community engagement and informed consent in genomic research in this region, and we recommend further studies to explore this emerging trend.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8cb246f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olubunmi Ogunrin, Kerry Woolfall, Mark Gabbay, Lucy Frith&lt;/p&gt;

The spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity pose a great challenge to accurately estimate the carbon flux in global carbon cycling, which has primarily been researched in flatlands versus hillslope ecosystems. On an eroded slope (35°) of the semiarid Loess Plateau, soil respiration, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; at upper and lower slope positions in triplicate from 2014 until 2016, and the soil biochemical and microbial properties were determined. The results showed that soil respiration was significantly greater (by 44.2%) at the lower slope position (2.6 μmol m&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;) than at the upper slope position, as were soil moisture, carbon, nitrogen fractions and root biomass. However, the temperature sensitivity was 13.2% greater at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The soil fungal community changed from being Basidiomycota-dominant at the upper slope position to being Zygomycota-dominant at the lower slope position, corresponding with increased β-D-glucosidase activity at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position. We concluded that soil respiration was enhanced by the greater soil moisture, root biomass, carbon and nitrogen contents at the lower slope position than at the upper slope position. Moreover, the increased soil respiration and decreased temperature sensitivity at the lower slope position were partially due to copiotrophs replacing oligotrophs. Such spatial variations along slopes must be properly accounted for when estimating the carbon budget and feedback of future climate change on hillslope ecosystems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>767ae66b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qiqi Sun, Rui Wang, Yaxian Hu, Lunguang Yao, Shengli Guo&lt;/p&gt;

By using the existing tool vg to build a pan-genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, we validate our approach by showing that Graph Peak Caller with a pan-genome reference graph can trace variants within peaks that are not part of the linear reference genome, and find peaks that in general are more motif-enriched than those found by MACS2.</description><crawled>1521844197208</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286823v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>3</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286823v1?rss=1</link><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Graph Peak Caller: calling ChIP-Seq Peaks on Graph-based Reference Genomes [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>False</unread><published>1521788400000</published><author><name>Grytten, I.</name></author><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/23/286823</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286823v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16254fb9758:4a295f4:34f43e70</id></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russian science chases escape from mediocrity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian science chases escape from mediocrity, Published online: 13 March 2018;

Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical features of postoperative delirium are similar to the core features of alpha synuclein-related cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which precede the cardinal motor features of PD, are likely to be risk factors for developing postoperative delirium. We investigated the association between PD-related NMSs and postoperative delirium in old people undergoing elective spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective study. Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis. We assessed eight easily-assessed and representative PD-related NMSs 1 day before the scheduled surgery using tests or questionnaires for each symptom. The presence of delirium was determined by using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Fifteen (14.4%) of the 104 participants (age, 71.7 ± 4.7 years; men, 34.6%) met the CAM criteria for post-operative delirium. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that decreased olfactory function (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.44–0.91) and exhibiting rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD, OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09–1.93) were significantly independent predictors of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study shows that hyposmia and RBD are significantly independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in general elderly population. Considering that NMSs may represent burden of alpha synuclein deposit, we postulate that an underlying alpha synucleinopathy may correlates with postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Significance &lt;p&gt;This study gives a novel insight for the risk factor of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>217a9dd7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ki Hoon Kim, Suk Yun Kang, Dong Ah Shin, Seong Yi, Yoon Ha, Keung Nyun Kim, Young Ho Sohn, Phil Hyu Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Past and contemporary human actions are causing numerous changes in patterns and processes at various ecosystem scales and trophic levels, including unintended downstream changes, such as species interactions. In its native range &lt;i&gt;Acca sellowiana&lt;/i&gt; (Feijoa) combines some characteristics of human interactions: incipient domestication, restricted to subtropical Atlantic Forest highlands, associated with the threatened conifer &lt;i&gt;Araucaria angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Araucaria), within a domesticated landscape with anthropogenic forest patches, and provides fruit at a time of resource shortage (Araucaria seeds—&lt;i&gt;pinhão&lt;/i&gt;). We quantify the trophic relationships between Feijoa and vertebrates, and evaluate the influences on interactions caused by environmental variations, Feijoa domestication evidences, spatial distance and fruit availability. In four sites within protected areas, we selected 28 focal individuals of Feijoa (seven/site) and collected three temporal replicas between 2015 and 2016, when we measured productivity and frugivory via 45-second videos taken with camera traps. Using ecological network, rarefaction curves and variation partitioning analyses, we evaluate the frugivory network topology, the spatiotemporal structure of communities in relation to fruit availability and the influence of predictive variables on frugivory. We found a large spatiotemporal variation in productivity of Feijoa and that 20 species consumed Feijoa fruits, with a species degree of 2.8 (±5.7) and average Feijoa degree of 14.4 (±10.1), in a modular network with intermediary connectance. Rarefaction curves showed that richness and the independent records are congruent with the fruit amount. Variation partitioning showed that, for the focal individuals, canopy area, green coverage, patch size and distance to water influenced frugivory, and the Feijoa domestication influenced significantly the mammalian frugivory. Feijoa is an important resource that provides food during the time of year when &lt;i&gt;Pinhão&lt;/i&gt; is absent, and attracts frugivores, maintain the residual diversity of vertebrates contributing to the structure of communities in highlands. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the interactions between vertebrates and an incipient domesticated tree, in a cultural landscape and highly threatened environment, under a basal foodweb approach with implications for bottom-up and top-down forces. The results contribute to understanding animal-plant relationships, including concepts that can be replicated for other sessile prey and mobile predators in any region or habitat under different gradients of management.

Plant mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) vary in sequence structure. We assembled the &lt;i&gt;Brassica oleracea&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; mtDNA using a mean coverage depth of 25X whole genome sequencing (WGS) and confirmed the presence of eight contigs/fragments by BLASTZ using the previously reported KJ820683 and AP012988 mtDNA as reference. Assembly of the mtDNA sequence reads resulted in a circular structure of 219,975 bp. Our assembled mtDNA, NCBI acc. no. KU831325, contained 34 protein-coding genes, 3 rRNA genes, and 19 tRNA genes with similarity to the KJ820683 and AP012988 reference mtDNA. No large repeats were found in the KU831325 assembly. However, KU831325 showed differences in the arrangement of bases at different regions compared to the previously reported mtDNAs. In the reference mtDNAs KJ820683 and AP012988, contig/fragment number 4 is partitioned into two contigs/fragments, 4a and 4b. However, contig/fragment number 4 was a single contig/fragment with 29,661 bp in KU831325. PCR and qRT-PCR using flanking markers from separate parts of contig/fragment number 4 confirmed it to be a single contig/fragment. In addition, genome re-alignment of the plastid genome and mtDNAs supported the presence of heteroplasmy and reverse arrangement of the heteroplasmic blocks within the other mtDNAs compared to KU831325 that might be one of the causal factors for its diversity. Our results thus confirm the existence of different mtDNAs in diverse &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oleracea&lt;/i&gt; subspecies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fb3602a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kiwoung Yang, Ujjal Kumar Nath, Manosh Kumar Biswas, Md Abdul Kayum, Go-eun Yi, Jonghoon Lee, Tae-Jin Yang, Ill-Sup Nou&lt;/p&gt;
