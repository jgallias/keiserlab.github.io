Currently, information on nearshore reef-associated fisheries is frequently disparate or incomplete, creating a challenge for effective management. This study utilized an existing non-commercial fishery dataset from Hawaiʻi, covering the period 2004–13, to estimate a variety of fundamental fishery parameters, including participation, effort, gear use, and catch per unit effort. We then used those data to reconstruct total catches per island. Non-commercial fisheries in this case comprise recreational, subsistence, and cultural harvest, which may be exchanged, but are not sold. By combining those data with reported commercial catch data, we estimated annual catch of nearshore reef-associated fisheries in the main Hawaiian Islands over the study period to be 1,167,758 ± 43,059 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (mean ± standard error). Average annual commercial reef fish catch over the same time period—184,911 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—was 16% of the total catch, but that proportion varied greatly among islands, ranging from 23% on Oʻahu to 5% on Molokaʻi. These results emphasize the importance of reef fishing in Hawaiʻi for reasons beyond commerce, such as food security and cultural practice, and highlight the large differences in fishing practices across the Hawaiian Islands.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Estimating nearshore coral reef-associated fisheries production from the main Hawaiian Islands</title><fingerprint>7ed2156e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kaylyn S.

Radiation-induced lung damage is an important treatment-related toxicity after lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). After implementing a tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co magnetic-resonance image guided system, ViewRay&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, we compared the associated early radiological lung density changes to those associated with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Eight patients treated with the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system were matched 1:1 with patients treated with LINAC. Prescription doses were 52 Gy or 60 Gy in four fractions, and lung dose-volumetric parameters were calculated from each planning system. The first two follow-up computed tomography (CT) were co-registered with the planning CT through deformable registration software, and lung density was measured by isodose levels. Tumor size was matched between the two groups, but the planning target volume of LINAC was larger than that of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036). With regard to clinically relevant dose-volumetric parameters in the lungs, the ipsilateral lung mean dose, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10Gy&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;20Gy&lt;/sub&gt; were significantly poorer in tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co plans compared to LINAC plans (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, 0.036, and 0.017, respectively). Increased lung density was not observed in the first follow-up scan compared to the planning scan. A significant change of lung density was shown in the second follow-up scan and there was no meaningful difference between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for all dose regions. In addition, no patient developed clinical radiation pneumonitis until the second follow-up scan. Therefore, there was no significant difference in the early radiological lung damage between the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system and LINAC for lung SABR despite of the inferior plan quality of the tri-&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co system compared to that of LINAC.

A suitable irrigation method adopted to arid desert conditions, including a special soil structure and specialized plants, has been continuously studied and improved. A field study was conducted in the Awei irrigation area of Aletai in Xinjiang in 2015 and 2016 to investigate the applicability of shallow subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) in an arid desert area. A completely randomized block design with three replications and three treatments for drip tape subsurface depths at 5, 10, 20 cm was established. The results indicated that the vertical distribution of the soil moisture of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI, buried depth at 20 cm) was mainly concentrated at 0–60 cm, while SSDI (buried depth at 5 and 10 cm) was concentrated at 0–30 cm. However, the roots distributions were concentrated at 0–30 cm for SDI and SSDI. The chlorophyll content and water consumption intensity for alfalfa first increased and then decreased in arid desert conditions. The dry yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of SSDI (buried depth at 10 cm) were higher than those of SDI. The SSDI was practical in arid desert conditions and the recommended buried depth was 10 cm.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195965</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195965</link><published>1523653200000</published><title>Adaptability of shallow subsurface drip irrigation of alfalfa in an arid desert area of Northern Xinjiang</title><fingerprint>2af7be7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shufang Wang, Xiyun Jiao, Weihua Guo, Jian Lu, Yungang Bai, Liping Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes progressive disability in 1 of every 5,000 boys due to the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Despite much advancement in knowledge about DMD disease presentation and progression—attributable in part to studies using mouse and canine models of the disease–current DMD treatments are not equally effective in all patients. There remains, therefore, a need for translational animal models in which novel treatment targets can be identified and evaluated. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of DMD. As with DMD, speed of disease progression in GRMD varies substantially. However, unlike DMD, all GRMD dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the GRMD dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 GRMD dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which GRMD stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with DMD and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of GRMD as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) in faster-progressing GRMD dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in GRMD and DMD. In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Expression profiling of disease progression in canine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title><fingerprint>816dcdf7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford, Candice Chu, Cynthia Balog-Alvarez, Xue Yu, James J.

Super-critical carbon dioxide energy-storage (SC-CCES) technology is a new type of gas energy-storage technology. This paper used orthogonal method and variance analysis to make significant analysis on the factors which would affect the thermodynamics characteristics of the SC-CCES system and obtained the significant factors and interactions in the energy-storage process, the energy-release process and the whole energy-storage system. Results have shown that the interactions in the components have little influence on the energy-storage process, the energy-release process and the whole energy-storage process of the SC-CCES system, the significant factors are mainly on the characteristics of the system component itself, which will provide reference for the optimization of the thermal properties of the energy-storage system.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195614</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195614</link><published>1523394000000</published><title>Analysis of exergy efficiency of a super-critical compressed carbon dioxide energy-storage system based on the orthogonal method</title><fingerprint>50523bc8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Qing He, Yinping Hao, Hui Liu, Wenyi Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Periodic DFT calculations with atom‐centered Gaussian basis functions with the Turbomole program are used to calculate lattice energies for several non‐covalently bound organic molecular crystals.

Indeed, this is essential for making controlled comparisons between different observations or distributing software to be used by others. Providing this type of reproducibility, however, is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which often contain multiple versions. In many fields as wells as bioinformatics, these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. We are proposing a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and taking care of their dependencies. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines for the analysis of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Bisulfite-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq. All pipelines process raw experimental data generating reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise apart from using the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own data sets or bioinformaticians who would want to automate parts or all of their analysis.

We present a series of excavated Middle Stone Age sites from the Olorgesailie basin, southern Kenya, dating from ≥295,000 to ~320,000 years ago by argon-40/argon-39 and uranium-series methods. Hominins at these sites made prepared cores and points, exploited iron-rich rocks to obtain red pigment, and procured stone tool materials from ≥25- to 50-kilometer distances.

We present a series of excavated Middle Stone Age sites from the Olorgesailie basin, southern Kenya, dating from ≥295,000 to ~320,000 years ago by argon-40/argon-39 and uranium-series methods. Hominins at these sites made prepared cores and points, exploited iron-rich rocks to obtain red pigment, and procured stone tool materials from ≥25- to 50-kilometer distances. Associated fauna suggests a broad resource strategy that included large and small prey. These practices imply notable changes in how individuals and groups related to the landscape and to one another and provide documentation relevant to human social and cognitive evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Anthropology, Geochemistry, Geophysics</item></keywords><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a52982d:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/90.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24092-w</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Swee Hoe Ong</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Optimised metrics for CRISPR-KO screens with second-generation gRNA libraries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Optimised metrics for CRISPR-KO screens with second-generation gRNA libraries, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24092-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24092-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Optimised metrics for CRISPR-KO screens with second-generation gRNA libraries&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/_gbJRuu6mMI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24092-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/_gbJRuu6mMI/s41598-018-24092-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24092-w</link><published>1523516400000</published><title>Author Correction: Optimised metrics for CRISPR-KO screens with second-generation gRNA libraries</title><fingerprint>da637f53</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Optimised metrics for CRISPR-KO screens with second-generation gRNA libraries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Optimised metrics for CRISPR-KO screens with second-generation gRNA libraries, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24092-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24092-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Optimised metrics for CRISPR-KO screens with second-generation gRNA libraries&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/_gbJRuu6mMI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b6cb9e2b:918ca2:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523485220395</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019405?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Milan K.

For CyberKnife-mediated prostate cancer treatment, a tumour-tracking approach is applied to correct the target location by acquiring X-ray images of implanted fiducial markers intermittently. This study investigated the dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion during CyberKnife treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients treated using the CyberKnife (35 Gy delivered in five fractions). Using log files of recorded prostate motion, the intra-fraction prostate motion was simulated. We defined the worst-case intra-fraction prostate motion as the difference between pre- and post-deviation on log files and shifted structure sets according to the corresponding offsets for each beam. The dose–volume indices were calculated and compared with the original plan in terms of clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (CTV plus a 2-mm margin), rectum, bladder, and urethra. Prostate motions of &gt;3, &gt;5, and &gt;10 mm were observed for 31.3, 9.1, and 0.5% of the 1929 timestamps, respectively. Relative differences between the simulated and original plans were mostly less than 1%. Although significant decreases were observed in D&lt;sub&gt;50%&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;98%&lt;/sub&gt; of the target, absolute dose differences were &amp;lt;0.1 Gy compared with the planned dose. The dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion may be small even with longer treatment durations, indicating that the tumour tracking using the CyberKnife could be a robust system for examining prostate motion.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195296</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195296</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion under a tumour-tracking system in hypofractionated robotic radiosurgery</title><fingerprint>9e0317df</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuhei Koike, Iori Sumida, Hirokazu Mizuno, Hiroya Shiomi, Keita Kurosu, Seiichi Ota, Yasuo Yoshioka, Osamu Suzuki, Keisuke Tamari, Kazuhiko Ogawa&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication. Participants were sampled purposefully and taking through in-depth interviews using an interview guide. Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability. Other factors identified to influence non-adherence included polypharmacy practice; tight work schedules; social norms; poor prescription instruction by health providers; and knowledge and experience of medication.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Findings suggests the need for health providers to adopt therapeutic approaches that take into account patients’ beliefs, values and norms in administering medications.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery programme (ERAS) is an approach to the perioperative care of patients encompassing multiple interventions and involving a wide range of different actors. It can thus be defined as a complex intervention. Despite the strength of the evidence-base in its support, the implementation of ERAS has been slow. This paper specifically explores the utility of Normalization Process Theory (NPT) as a methodological framework to aid exploration of ERAS implementation, with a focus on the core NPT construct &lt;i&gt;coherence&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and materials &lt;p&gt;The study employed qualitative methods guided by NPT. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-six healthcare professionals working in three specialities (thoracic, colorectal, head and neck) in a UK hospital. Data were analysed using an adapted Framework Approach.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coherence&lt;/i&gt;, or sense-making work, was key to successful implementation and demonstrated in the importance of participants believing in ERAS both as an individual and as a team. In order to invest in ERAS individuals needed to be able to differentiate its practices favourably with those enacted pre-implementation (differentiation). Participants also needed to understand their specific tasks and responsibilities (individual specification) and build a shared understanding (communal specification), resolving differences in planning meetings. Belief in the worth of ERAS was often aligned to evidence for its effectiveness or benefit to patients (internalization), so implementing ERAS therefore ‘made sense’. Sense-making work had strong links with aspects of implementation related to other NPT constructs including resource issues such as funding for data collection and feedback (reflexive monitoring: systemization) and failure to replace key staff members (collective action: skill set workability).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;NPT was found to be a valuable heuristic device to employ in the exploration of ERAS implementation processes. NPT was useful in facilitating recognition of the importance of &lt;i&gt;coherence&lt;/i&gt; work to successful implementation.

However despite participants’ strong beliefs in the worth of ERAS, it was in translating these beliefs into action that barriers were encountered, highlighting the interconnectedness of NPT constructs and the complicated nature of implementing complex interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195890</canonicalUrl><updated>1524085200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe33:34f43e70</id><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04534-1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>Robert Costanza</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to retool our concept of value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to retool our concept of value, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04534-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04534-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Robert Costanza applauds Mariana Mazzucato’s call for more-productive, equal and sustainable economies.</description><engagement>6</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04534-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04534-1</link><published>1524034800000</published><title>How to retool our concept of value</title><fingerprint>cf40773</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to retool our concept of value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to retool our concept of value, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04534-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04534-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Robert Costanza applauds Mariana Mazzucato’s call for more-productive, equal and sustainable economies.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162d8593b82:38d9fc0:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04534-1/d41586-018-04534-1_15632952.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1524048149378</crawled><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>0.43</engagementRate></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34420</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><author><name>jbloom@fredhutch.org (Adam S Dingens)</name></author><description>The immediate evolutionary space accessible to HIV is largely determined by how single amino-acid mutations affect fitness.

I can state as a fact that the first time I heard a joking reference to his attitude towards traditional synthetic organic chemistry was in the summer of 1983, so it’s not like he’s been keeping his thoughts bottled up. But this is certainly a good summary of them, and here’s the key question that’s being asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The ability to put together molecules – bit‐by‐bit, simple or complex – is one of chemistry’s great accomplishments, and a source of amazement to those in many other fields of science. More than one physicist has told me that s/he cannot believe that it is possible to manipulate bonds between individual atoms with the skill that organic chemists do. When I look at a complex structure assembled in a beautifully organized campaign, I also am amazed. That said, all fields of science morph with time. The phrase “organic synthesis” has come to mean “synthesis of structurally complex natural products”, or, perhaps, “synthesis of complicated molecules with pharmaceutical activity.” Nature, and relevance to healthcare, define the targets, and provide the utilitarian justification for the effort. Is there (or should there be) more to it than that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidiary questions are whether organic synthesis of that sort is worth the effort that’s being put into it and whether it trains students to do useful things and whether other types of work could do a better job of that. In order to address these, Whitesides notes, we have to make sure that we’re talking about the same things. He defines “organic synthesis” (small letters) as any sort of putting-together-of-organic molecules, and “Organic Synthesis” (with the capitals) as the sort of complex and often natural-product-based synthesis practiced by R. B. Woodward, his contemporaries, and his intellectual heirs. The latter is what many people mean by those two words, to be sure, and Whitesides has some questions about just what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the field a science that generates new concepts and new theory? Is it instead more of an art form, driven at least partly by aesthetic choices (that can be appreciated by skilled observers) rather than utility &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;? Or is it something of a craft, achieving its results (in the end) through skilled empirical tinkering? These questions, especially in the way that they’re phrased, are likely to cause intense annoyance in some practitioners. But I think that the annoyance is a sign that these categories are uncomfortably plausible and recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the field partakes of all of these characteristics, but on what proportions? I think that the science/craft distinction is actually one question, and that these are on the same scale with opposite signs: the more solid the theoretical framework, the less Edisonian tinkering. My opinion is toward the Edisonian end. Organic synthesis is not bereft of theories and organizing concepts, but they do not operate strongly enough (that is, in a detailed enough fashion) to allow us to predict (for example) reaction conditions. That’s why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. The same goes for predicting new reactions, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/11/24/reaction_discovery_reviewed&quot;&gt;we do this&lt;/a&gt;. No one sat down a few decades ago and said “Y’know, my knowledge of organometallic chemistry allows me to predict that palladium, in particular, will show oxidative addition/reductive elimination behavior that will be spectacularly useful in carbon-carbon bond formation. And while I’m making bold predictions, you might try aryl boronic acids for that reaction first, even though hardly any such things have even been described”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for art, I would very much like to have a dollar for every total-synthesis person who has talked about the field in terms of its artistic qualities. We have Woodward to thank for this – the man was a &lt;em&gt;tremendous&lt;/em&gt; scientist, but his influence has &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/22/woodwards-prose-style&quot;&gt;not always been&lt;/a&gt; for the good. I don’t think nearly as many people went into spasms about elegance and beauty in reference to total synthesis before him, and what’s more annoying is that those are valid concepts to apply even if Woodward sometimes came across like an Aubrey Beardsley aesthete about them. My own view is that we should let the artistic qualities of organic synthesis, which exist, speak for themselves. Because if they can’t, no amount of &lt;em&gt;raffiniert&lt;/em&gt; gushing about them will substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitesides isn’t through. That three-parter is just his first of three questions! The second one is a two-parter: is organic synthesis best thought of as an enabling technology to do things (such as make drugs, etc.) or as a framework that lets us ask questions about the nature of molecules and their behavior? That is, are the uses to which we put this field, and the justifications we give for it, best described as practical ones or intellectual ones? We tend to haul out the former first and start talking in better-living-through-(organic)-chemistry style, and that’s understandable. Compounds made through organic synthesis, and available through no other practical means, are crucial underpinnings of the modern world. If we’re not proud of that, what are we to be proud of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that second justification, while it sounds like more aesthetic hand-waving to the lay public (and to funding agencies), has some staying power. Ask the physicists, or even the mathematicians. Asking fundamental questions, and having the right framework in which to be able to ask them, can pay off hugely even from the practical end, intellectual satisfaction aside. There’s a lot of number theory that was just another ornament of mathematics until it became vital for modern cryptography and secure communications (G. H. Hardy would have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2IK9D0o&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;horrified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Relativity was a fantastic intellectual feat by Einstein, but relativistic corrections are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html&quot;&gt;needed&lt;/a&gt; to make the GPS system work correctly, among many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third question is, what should we teach chemistry students about the field? That is, what are the most important things for them to know? There’s a massive pile of empirical knowledge, famously dreaded by sophomores, but it’s taught (or should be!) according to general organizing principles – although those are the very ones that are not quite adequate enough to explain everything that’s going on. At what level should we teach this subject? You can say “Here are reactions that depend on alpha-carbonyl anions, and here’s why they happen”, you can say “Time to learn the difference between the Dieckmann and Claisen condensations”, or “Here are the kinds of products these reactions form and what they’re used for”, or “Here are some tips on how to run these things at the bench”, and on and on. What should be in the syllabus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own take on this is that there should definitely be a bias towards the general principles, which is what the better organic chemistry professors already do. Teaching the subject as a pile of reactions is a crime. I may be too loose about this stuff, but I would rather a student, if it came down to it, mess up a bit on the detailed mechanism of the Mitsunobu reaction if they understand that its driving force is the thermodynamic sink of triphenylphosphine oxide formation. The difference between the Dieckmann and the Claisen condensations is that the former is intramolecular and the latter is intermolecular, but I think it’s a waste of brain space to give them different names and memorize them as such. I would much rather that a student, in this case, immediately recognize the mechanism of an alpha-carbonyl anion attacking an ester carbonyl (no matter what the name associated with that process is) and recognize the influence of the leaving group of the ester, the stability vs. reactivity characteristics of the nucleophile, the likelihood of the various ring sizes being formed in the intramolecular reaction, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nowhere near exhausted the Annoying Questions of George Whitesides, but this post is long enough as it is! Look for Part II tomorrow or the next day. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Chemical News</item><item>General Scientific News</item><item>Natural Products</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162ba0b3650:dd4dc9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523539719760</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/12/the-thoughts-of-george-whitesides-part-i</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4140.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Ioanna Ntai, Luca Fornelli, Caroline J.

Previous methods for comparing GO terms have relied on the fact that GO terms are organized into a tree structure. In this paradigm, the locations of two GO terms in the tree dictate their similarity score. In this paper, we introduce two new solutions for this problem, by focusing instead on the definitions of the GO terms. We apply neural network based techniques from the natural language processing (NLP) domain. The first method does not rely on the GO tree, whereas the second indirectly depends on the GO tree. In our first approach, we compare two GO definitions by treating them as two unordered sets of words. The word similarity is estimated by a word embedding model that maps words into an N-dimensional space. In our second approach, we account for the word-ordering within a sentence. We use a sentence encoder to embed GO definitions into vectors and estimate how likely one definition entails another. We validate our methods in two ways. In the first experiment, we test the model&apos;s ability to differentiate a true protein-protein network from a randomly generated network. In the second experiment, we test the model in identifying orthologs from randomly-matched genes in human, mouse, and fly. In both experiments, a hybrid of NLP and GO-tree based method achieves the best classification accuracy.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/103648v4?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/103648v4?rss=1</link><published>1521529200000</published><title>Word and sentence embedding tools to measure semantic similarity of Gene Ontology terms by their definitions [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>98ffe6a5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Gene Ontology (GO) database contains GO terms that describe biological functions of genes.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) emphasises the role of biodiversity in delivering benefits essential for all people and, as a result, seeks to safeguard all life-forms. The indices that are used to measure progress towards international conservation and sustainability goals, however, focus solely on the ‘native’ component of biodiversity. A subset of non-native species can cause undesirable economic, social, or biological effects. But non-native species also contribute to regional biodiversity (species richness and biotic interactions) and ecosystem services. In some regions and cities, non-native species make up more than half of all species. Currently, the contributions of these species to biodiversity and ecosystem services are overlooked. Here, I argue that biodiversity and sustainability indices should include all species. This is not only consistent with definitions of biodiversity but also will promote the idea that long-term, sustainable, human well-being is intricately tied to benefits derived from nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-8DNjfEBZcQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523998800000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162d4c15df7:4bb2d:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martin A.

In applications of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in clinical psychiatry settings in Japan, a phonemic verbal fluency test (VFT) that includes “switching” (the ability to shift efficiently to a new word subcategory) to assess phonemic fluency is employed to capture disease-specific hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, to extend the specific features of this test, the VFT was repeated to examine an activation change in NIRS measurements in 20 healthy males.

In applications of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in clinical psychiatry settings in Japan, a phonemic verbal fluency test (VFT) that includes “switching” (the ability to shift efficiently to a new word subcategory) to assess phonemic fluency is employed to capture disease-specific hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, to extend the specific features of this test, the VFT was repeated to examine an activation change in NIRS measurements in 20 healthy males. Without task performance change, the hemodynamic activation induced by the VFT was significantly attenuated in the left PFC through repetition of the task. These findings suggest that the left PFC is involved in processing of the VFT. Further, it may be possible to extend the current VFT using this repetition to provide a more sensitive examination of the left PFC, whose dysfunction has been reported in several psychiatric diseases such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193994</canonicalUrl><updated>1521666000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087dd:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292987v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><author><name>Miraldi, E.

In this resource-rich mammalian setting, our extensive benchmarking provides quantitative, genome-scale evaluation of TRN inference combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data. We refine and extend our previous Th17 TRN, using our new TRN inference methods to integrate all Th17 data (gene expression, ATAC-seq, TF KO, ChIP-seq).

Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Identification of aaNAT5b as a spermine N-acetyltransferase in the mosquito, &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>ff4d936c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To investigate the factors associated with age at natural menopause in a large population of Chinese adult women.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study was part of the baseline survey of China Kadoorie Biobank in Zhejiang Province. A total of 17,076 postmenopausal women were included in the present study. Relevant data of socio-demographic, lifestyle, dietary and reproductive characteristics were collected. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the associated factors of age at natural menopause with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean age at natural menopause was 48.94 years, with 3.40% of the women experienced premature menopause and 6.75% early menopause. Younger age, higher education, consumption of meat (1–3 days per week) and increased parity were associated with late menopause. Current smoking, underweight, higher physical activity, consumption of sea food (1–3 days per week), fresh eggs (≥4 days per week), fresh fruits (≥1 day per week), taking vitamins, experiencing severe food shortage, earlier age at menarche and older age at first birth were associated with earlier age at natural menopause.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that certain factors involved with socio-demographic, lifestyle, dietary and reproductive characteristics are related to the age at natural menopause in Chinese women.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195658</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195658</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Age at natural menopause and associated factors in adult women: Findings from the China Kadoorie Biobank study in Zhejiang rural area</title><fingerprint>b857dbf0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Meng Wang, Wei-Wei Gong, Ru-Ying Hu, Hao Wang, Yu Guo, Zheng Bian, Jun Lv, Zheng-Ming Chen, Li-Ming Li, Min Yu&lt;/p&gt;

When matching sequencing reads to a database of genomes, low-complexity regions and contaminants in genome assemblies can attract many reads to the wrong genomes. Alignment information may be used to recognize that many reads are piling up in a small number of locations, but fast k-mer based metagenomic classifiers do not provide alignments, and re-alignment is expensive. We propose using k-mer coverage, which can be computed during classification, as a proxy for genome base coverage. Results: We present KrakenHLL, a sequence classifier that records the number of unique k-mers observed in each taxon in a metagenomics data set. KrakenHLL is based on the ultra-fast classification engine Kraken, which it combines with a cardinality estimator known as HyperLogLog (HLL). We demonstrate that many false-positive identifications can be identified using unique k-mer counts, especially when looking at species present in low abundance. KrakenHLL&apos;s database includes over 100,000 additional viral strain sequences not used in the standard Kraken database, and it also has the ability to map against multiple databases and identify plasmids and strains using an extended taxonomy. KrakenHLL&apos;s run time is similar to that of Kraken, and it requires only a very modest increase in memory.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262956v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262956v2?rss=1</link><published>1522738800000</published><title>KrakenHLL: Confident and fast metagenomics classification using unique k-mer counts [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>8b209955</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: False positive identifications are a significant problem in metagenomics.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is the transformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promote tumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motile tumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeleton regulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling of unbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2 (mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underlies tumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whether CAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media (CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly and robustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammary fibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAF cell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine array analysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative to control WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2 protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195278</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195278</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote breast cancer motility by suppressing mammalian Diaphanous-related formin-2 (mDia2)</title><fingerprint>8ed0de76</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kaitlyn M.

Transcription as the key step in gene expression is a highly regulated process. The speed of transcription elongation depends on the underlying gene sequence and varies on a gene by gene basis. The reason for this sequence dependence is not known in detail. Recently, our group studied the cross talk between the nascent RNA and the transcribing RNA polymerase by screening the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genome for RNA sequences with high affinity to RNA Pol by performing genomic SELEX. This approach led to the identification of RNA polymerase-binding APtamers termed “RAPs”. RAPs can have positive and negative effects on gene expression. A subgroup is able to downregulate transcription via the activity of the termination factor Rho. In this study, we used a similar SELEX setup using yeast genomic DNA as source of RNA sequences and highly purified yeast RNA Pol II as bait and obtained almost 1300 yeast-derived RAPs. Yeast RAPs are found throughout the genome within genes and antisense to genes, they are overrepresented in the non-transcribed strand of yeast telomeres and underrepresented in intergenic regions. Genes harbouring a RAP are more likely to show lower mRNA levels. By determining the endogenous expression levels as well as using a reporter system, we show that RAPs located within coding regions can reduce the transcript level downstream of the RAP. Here we demonstrate that RAPs represent a novel type of regulatory RNA signal in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; that act in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and interfere with the elongating transcription machinery to reduce the transcriptional output.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Nascent RNA signaling to yeast RNA Pol II during transcription elongation</title><fingerprint>a37b0dbb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Klopf, Murielle Moes, Fabian Amman, Bob Zimmermann, Frederike von Pelchrzim, Christina Wagner, Renée Schroeder&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA. HMR programs provide weekly group coaching to achieve reduced calorie intake, increased fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity ≥2,000 kcal/wk. A Markov model predicted avoidance of diabetes and cardiovascular events and projected cost savings due to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 500 patients included in the analysis, 67% were female and mean age was 54.1 years (s.d. 11.6). The baseline weight and BMI were 243.5 lbs (range 144.0–545.0) and 38.8 kg/m2 (range 25.4–85.0), respectively. Overall, patients lost an average of 47.4 lbs (18.9% of initial body weight [IBW]); the amount of weight loss was consistent among those with diabetes/pre-diabetes (50%), high/moderate risk for dyslipidemia (60%), hypertension/pre-hypertension (86%), and severe obesity (37%). The mean IBW lost was 16.4%, 19.3%, 20.7% for ≤6 months (n = 165), 7–12 months (n = 140), 13–24 months (n = 195) of program participation, respectively. The simulation model estimated 22 diabetes and 30 cardiovascular events and $1,992,370 medical costs avoided over 5 years in the 500 patients evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Patients in the HMR clinic-based HILI program achieved substantial weight loss regardless of duration of program participation, risk profile and comorbid status.

Overall, we believe that this distributed representation of genes may be useful for more bioinformatics applications.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/22/286096</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1624e1719a1:3eb69a9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521728559521</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195836</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Igor Yu.

Echinoderms are capable of asexual reproduction by fission. An individual divides into parts due to changes in the strength of connective tissue of the body wall. The structure of connective tissue and the mechanisms of variations in its strength in echinoderms remain poorly studied. An analysis of transcriptomes of individuals during the process of fission provides a new opportunity to understand the mechanisms of connective tissue mutability. In the holothurian &lt;i&gt;Cladolabes schmeltzii&lt;/i&gt;, we have found a rather complex organization of connective tissue. Transcripts of genes encoding a wide range of structural proteins of extracellular matrix, as well as various proteases and their inhibitors, have been discovered. All these molecules may constitute a part of the mechanism of connective tissue mutability. According to our data, the extracellular matrix of echinoderms is substantially distinguished from that of vertebrates by the lack of elastin, fibronectins, and tenascins. In case of fission, a large number of genes of transcription factors and components of different signaling pathways are expressed. Products of these genes are probably involved in regulation of asexual reproduction, connective tissue mutability, and preparation of tissues for subsequent regeneration. It has been shown that holothurian tensilins are a special group of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which has formed within the class Holothuroidea and is absent from other echinoderms. Our data can serve a basis for the further study of the mechanisms of extracellular matrix mutability, as well as the mechanisms responsible for asexual reproduction in echinoderms.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195836</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195836</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Molecular mechanisms of fission in echinoderms: Transcriptome analysis</title><fingerprint>9dc269e0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Igor Yu.

Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>The farm cost of decreasing antimicrobial use in dairy production</title><fingerprint>97dca45</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Lhermie, Loren William Tauer, Yrjo Tapio Gröhn&lt;/p&gt;

to fuels is required to enable the production of sustainable fuels and to
contribute to alleviating CO2 emissions. In considering conversion
of CO2, the initial step of adsorption and activation by the catalyst
is crucial. In addressing this difficult problem, we have examined how
nanoclusters of reducible metal oxides supported on TiO2 can promote
CO2 activation. In this paper we present density functional theory
(DFT) simulations of CO2 activation on heterostructures composed of extended
rutile and anatase TiO2 surfaces modified with chromia nanoclusters.
The heterostructures show non-bulk Cr and O sites in the nanoclusters and an
upshifted valence band edge that is dominated by Cr 3d- O 2p interactions. We
show that the supported chromia nanoclusters can adsorb and activate CO2 and
that activation of CO2 is promoted whether the TiO2
support is oxidised or hydroxylated. Reduced heterostructures, formed by
removal of oxygen from the chromia nanocluster, also promote CO2
activation. In the strong CO2 adsorption modes, the molecule bends
giving O-C-O angles of 127 - 132o and elongation of C-O distances up
to 1.30 Å; no carbonates are formed. The electronic properties show a strong CO2-Cr-O
interaction that drives the interaction of CO2 with the nanocluster
and induces the structural distortions. These results highlight that a metal
oxide support modified with reducible metal oxide nanoclusters can activate CO2,
thus helping to overcome difficulties associated with the difficult first step
in CO2 conversion.</description><engagement>4</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Activation_of_CO2_at_Chromia-Nanocluster-Modified_Rutile_and_Anatase_TiO2/6025658</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Converting CO2

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We wanted to re-evaluate the influence of confined placental mosaicism subtypes (type 2 and type 3) on pregnancy characteristics and outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;From July 2009 to December 2015, 5512 chorionic villus samplings were performed in our Fetal Medicine Center. Conventional karyotyping was performed after long-term and short-term cultured villi to define type 2 or type 3 confined placental mosaicisms. Karyotype after amniocentesis was performed to exclude true fetal mosaicism, when appropriate. Pregnancy characteristics and outcomes were collected and compared to a control population.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-six (0.65%) confined placental mosaicisms were observed (13 type 2 and 23 type 3). Nuchal translucency was not increased for type 2 and type 3 confined placental mosaicisms. Pregnancy characteristics and outcomes were comparable between type 2 confined placental mosaicisms and the control population. In type 3 confined placental mosaicisms, median first trimester serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A was lower than for the control population (p&amp;lt;0.001), preterm births were noticed in 56% (p&amp;lt;0.001), small for gestational age newborns in 74% (p&amp;lt;0.001), and adverse pregnancy outcome was reported in 35% (p&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although type 2 confined placental mosaicisms appeared to have no influence on pregnancy characteristics and outcome, type 3 confined placental mosaicisms were associated with low levels of first trimester serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, preterm birth, small for gestational age newborns, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195905</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195905</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Confined placental mosaicism revisited: Impact on pregnancy characteristics and outcome</title><fingerprint>4732019a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jérôme Toutain, Damien Goutte-Gattat, Jacques Horovitz, Robert Saura&lt;/p&gt;

This paper studies the Retailer Stackelberg game in a supply chain consisting of two manufacturers and one retailer where they compete simultaneously under three factors including price, service and simple price discount contract. It is assumed that the second manufacturer provides service directly to his customers, and the retailer provides service for the first product’s customers, while the retailer buys the first product under price discount from the first manufacturer. The analysis of the optimal equilibrium solutions and the results of the numerical examples show that if a manufacturer chooses the appropriate range of discount rate, he will gain more profit than when there is no discount given to the retailer. This situation can be considered as an effective tool for the coordination of the first manufacturer and the retailer to offer discount by manufacturer and to provide the service by the retailer. We obtain equilibrium solution of Retailer Stackelberg game and analyze the numerical examples under two cases: a) the manufacturers sell their products to the retailer without price discount contract. b) The first manufacturer sells his products to the retailer with the simple price discount contract. The preliminary results show that the service and the price discount contract can improve the performance of supply chain.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195109</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195109</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Retailer Stackelberg game in a supply chain with pricing and service decisions and simple price discount contract</title><fingerprint>2adf9807</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seyed Jafar Sadjadi, Hashem Asadi, Ramin Sadeghian, Hadi Sahebi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to summarize and discuss the similarities and differences in inflammatory biomarkers in postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic retrieval of literature up to June 2017 in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and the Wanfang database was conducted. Extracted data were analyzed with STATA (version 14). The standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each indicator were calculated using a random effect model. We also performed tests of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, assessments of bias, and meta-regression in this meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 54 observational studies were included. By meta-analysis we found significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (9 studies, SMD 0.883, 95% CI 0.130 to 1.637, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 10 studies, SMD -0.133, 95% CI -0.512 to 0.246, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.429 in POCD) and interleukin (IL)-6 (7 studies, SMD 0.386, 95% CI 0.054 to 0.717, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 16 studies, SMD 0.089, 95% CI -0.133 to 0.311, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.433 in POCD) concentrations in both POD and POCD patients. We also found that the SMDs of CRP and IL-6 from POCD patients were positively correlated with surgery type in the meta-regression (CRP: Coefficient = 1.555365, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 10 studies; IL-6: Coefficient = -0.6455521, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.086, 16 studies).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Available evidence from medium-to-high quality observational studies suggests that POD and POCD are indeed correlated with the concentration of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers. Some of these markers, such as CRP and IL-6, play roles in both POD and POCD, while others are specific to either one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195659</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195659</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Inflammatory markers in postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD): A meta-analysis of observational studies</title><fingerprint>626b5664</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xuling Liu, Yang Yu, Shengmei Zhu&lt;/p&gt;

The ABCG2 multidrug transporter provides resistance against various endo- and xenobiotics, and protects the stem cells against toxins and stress conditions. We have shown earlier that a GFP-tagged version of ABCG2 is fully functional and may be used to follow the expression, localization and function of this transporter in living cells. In the present work we have overexpressed GFP-ABCG2, driven by a constitutive (CAG) promoter, in HUES9 human embryonic stem cells. Stem cell clones were generated to express the wild-type and a substrate-mutant (R482G) GFP-ABCG2 variant, by using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. We found that the stable overexpression of these transgenes did not change the pluripotency and growth properties of the stem cells, nor their differentiation capacity to hepatocytes or cardiomyocytes. ABCG2 overexpression provided increased toxin resistance in the stem cells, and protected the derived cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin toxicity. These studies document the potential of a stable ABCG2 expression for engineering toxin-resistant human pluripotent stem cells and selected stem cell derived tissues.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194925</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194925</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Generation of multidrug resistant human tissues by overexpression of the ABCG2 multidrug transporter in embryonic stem cells</title><fingerprint>ad7fb478</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zsuzsa Erdei, Anita Schamberger, György Török, Kornélia Szebényi, György Várady, Tamás I.

&lt;i&gt;Lolium perenne&lt;/i&gt; L. (perennial ryegrass) is the most important pasture grass species in temperate regions of the world. However, its growth is restricted in summer dry environments. Germplasm screening can be used to identify accessions or individual plants for incorporation into breeding programs for drought tolerance. We selected nine perennial ryegrass accessions from different global origins and from a range of climatic and environmental conditions. In addition, the perennial ryegrass cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’ was chosen as a reference. The accessions were grown for 360 days in a controlled environment through six consecutive drought stress and recovery cycles. We observed intraspecific differences in drought stress responsiveness for shoot biomass and survival from the third stress cycle. An accession from Norway had 50% more shoot dry matter than the next best-performing accession after six drought cycles. Compared with the reference cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’, shoot dry matter of the accession from Norway was more than seven times higher after six drought cycles, indicating superior performance of this ecotype under drought stress. Drought tolerance was characterized by osmotic adjustment and higher relative leaf water content at low soil moisture levels. Furthermore, the findings of this study identify solute potential as an early predictor of drought stress tolerance. These intraspecific differences can be used in breeding programs for the development of drought-tolerant perennial ryegrass cultivars.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194977</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194977</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Intraspecific differences in long-term drought tolerance in perennial ryegrass</title><fingerprint>ffb78184</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daliya Cyriac, Rainer W.

Background &lt;p&gt;Heavy burden of child injuries and lack of policy response in Ethiopia call for an improved understanding of the situation and development of action plans from multiple governmental agencies and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A consortium of international and Ethiopian researchers and stakeholders used extensive literature review and mixed analytical methods to estimate and project the burden of fatal and non-fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2030. Estimates were derived for children aged 0–14 years. Data sources include a longitudinal study conducted by the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia and the World Bank as well as model-based estimates from World Health Organization 2017 and Global Burden of Disease 2016 project.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Injuries caused about 25 thousand deaths among 0-14-year olds in Ethiopia in 2015. The leading cause of fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia was road-traffic injuries, followed by fire, heat and hot substances and drowning. The death rate due to injuries among 0–14 years olds was about 50 percent higher in males than females. Rural children were exposed to a greater risk of injury than their urban peers. The longitudinal survey suggests that the incidence rate of child injuries increased during the period 2011–2014. The annual mortality caused by injuries is projected to increase from 10,697 in 2015 to 11,279 in 2020 and 11,989 in 2030 among children under 5 years, an increase of 12 percentage points in 15 years. The number of deaths among 0-14-year olds will be 26,463, 27,807, and 30,364 respectively in 2015, 2020, and 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;As the first multisectoral collaboration on child injuries in Ethiopia, this study identified gaps in understanding of the burden of child injuries in Ethiopia. In consultation with Ethiopian government and other stakeholders, we propose starting an injury surveillance system at health clinics and hospitals and building an intervention package based on existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194692</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194692</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Child injuries in Ethiopia: A review of the current situation with projections</title><fingerprint>6d69379</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Qingfeng Li, Olakunle Alonge, Collene Lawhorn, Yirga Ambaw, Smita Kumar, Troy Jacobs, Adnan A.

In consultation with Ethiopian government and other stakeholders, we propose starting an injury surveillance system at health clinics and hospitals and building an intervention package based on existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194692</canonicalUrl><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f08:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0118-0</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Neuroscience</title></origin><author><name>Ivan Soltesz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CA1 pyramidal cell diversity enabling parallel information processing in the hippocampus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CA1 pyramidal cell diversity enabling parallel information processing in the hippocampus, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0118-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0118-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In this Review the authors discuss recent findings supporting a framework in which the hippocampus comprises principal cell subpopulations forming nonuniform parallel circuits that are independently controlled and affect a variety of behaviors.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0118-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0118-0</link><published>1522220400000</published><title>CA1 pyramidal cell diversity enabling parallel information processing in the hippocampus</title><fingerprint>8b152104</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CA1 pyramidal cell diversity enabling parallel information processing in the hippocampus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CA1 pyramidal cell diversity enabling parallel information processing in the hippocampus, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0118-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0118-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In this Review the authors discuss recent findings supporting a framework in which the hippocampus comprises principal cell subpopulations forming nonuniform parallel circuits that are independently controlled and affect a variety of behaviors.</content></content><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_1626dcc82ab:6af8114:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41593-018-0118-0/MediaObjects/41593_2018_118_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><height>249</height></visual><crawled>1522260542123</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1366?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>Zitvogel, L., Ma, Y., Raoult, D., Kroemer, G., Gajewski, T.

We aimed to determine the effects of levodopa medication on the performance of a repetitive pointing task while standing, and to investigate the optimal trial duration in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, and older adults. Seventeen individuals with Parkinson’s disease (5 freezers) and 9 older adults stood on force platforms for 30 s and 120 s while performing a bilateral repetitive pointing task, tracked by motion capture. Participants with Parkinson’s disease were assessed on and off medication and older adults were also assessed on separate days. The main findings were that: 1) on medication, participants with Parkinson’s exhibited greater center of pressure root mean square in the medial-lateral direction, greater velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions, and greater range in the medial-lateral direction than off medication; 2) longer trial durations resulted in greater center of pressure range in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and greater coefficient of variation in finger pointing on the least affected side; 3) Parkinson’s participants exhibited larger range in the medial-lateral direction compared to older adults; 4) off medication, freezers presented with less range and root mean square in the anterior-posterior direction than non-freezers; and 5) a correlation emerged between the freezing of gait questionnaire and pointing asymmetry and the coefficient of variation of pointing on the most affected side. Therefore, Parkinson’s medication may increase instability during a repetitive pointing task. Longer trials may provide a better depiction of sway by discriminating between those with and without neurological impairment. Individuals with Parkinson’s were less stable than older adults, supporting that they are at a greater risk for falls. The greater restrictive postural strategy in freezers compared to non-freezers is likely a factor that augments fall-risk. Lastly, the link between freezing of gait and upper-limb movement indicates that freezing may manifest first in the lower-limbs.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Medication and trial duration influence postural and pointing parameters during a standing repetitive pointing task in individuals with Parkinson’s disease</title><fingerprint>15afb55e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Deborah A.

Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of built-up areas for a wide range of applications. Recently developed approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of built-up areas using road network data. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard to different administrative regions and cities/towns. The results show that in most cases, the most-appropriate thresholds or ranges for different subdivisions are either identical or overlap—thus validating the use of the most-appropriate thresholds to delineate built-up areas for one or multiple small subdivisions and, by inference, for a much larger region.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194806</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194806</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Empirical approach to threshold determination for the delineation of built-up areas with road network data</title><fingerprint>4fd4a592</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Qi Zhou, Lei Guo&lt;/p&gt;

The posterior auricular muscle (PAM) reflex to sounds has been used clinically to determine hearing threshold as an alternative to other audiological diagnostic measures such as the auditory brainstem response. We have shown that the PAM response is also sensitive to interaural timing differences in normally hearing adults. PAM responses were evoked by both ipsilateral/ contralateral monaural stimulation and by binaural stimulation. Introducing sound delays ipsilaterally or contralaterally decreased the PAM response amplitude and increased its latency. The PAM response in this study shows a qualitatively similar pattern to that seen by the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the auditory brainstem potential to binaural clicks described in previous studies, in that both: have their shortest latency and maximal amplitudes centred around zero interaural timing differences, have response latencies increase with increasing interaural delays up to 1.2 ms and have response amplitudes decrease with increasing interaural delays of up to 1.2 ms. Our data show that the PAM response may be useful in measuring binaural integration in humans non-invasively for diagnostic or research studies.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194965</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194965</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>The effect of interaural timing on the posterior auricular muscle reflex in normal adult volunteers</title><fingerprint>3fd41e2a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by T.

Deciphering a function of a given protein requires investigating various biological aspects. Usually, the protein of interest is expressed with a fusion tag that aids or allows subsequent analyses. Additionally, downregulation or inactivation of the studied gene enables functional studies. Development of the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology opened many possibilities but in many cases it is restricted to non-essential genes. Recombinase-dependent gene integration methods, like the Flp-In system, are very good alternatives. The system is widely used in different research areas, which calls for the existence of compatible vectors and efficient protocols that ensure straightforward DNA cloning and generation of stable cell lines. We have created and validated a robust series of 52 vectors for streamlined generation of stable mammalian cell lines using the FLP recombinase-based methodology. Using the sequence-independent DNA cloning method all constructs for a given coding-sequence can be made with just three universal PCR primers. Our collection allows tetracycline-inducible expression of proteins with various tags suitable for protein localization, FRET, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), protein dynamics studies (FRAP), co-immunoprecipitation, the RNA tethering assay and cell sorting. Some of the vectors contain a bidirectional promoter for concomitant expression of miRNA and mRNA, so that a gene can be silenced and its product replaced by a mutated miRNA-insensitive version. Our toolkit and protocols have allowed us to create more than 500 constructs with ease. We demonstrate the efficacy of our vectors by creating stable cell lines with various tagged proteins (numatrin, fibrillarin, coilin, centrin, THOC5, PCNA). We have analysed transgene expression over time to provide a guideline for future experiments and compared the effectiveness of commonly used inducers for tetracycline-responsive promoters. As proof of concept we examined the role of the exoribonuclease XRN2 in transcription termination by RNAseq.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194887</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194887</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Versatile approach for functional analysis of human proteins and efficient stable cell line generation using FLP-mediated recombination system</title><fingerprint>f6d0d0c8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Roman J.

As proof of concept we examined the role of the exoribonuclease XRN2 in transcription termination by RNAseq.</content></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4247:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022787?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>W.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drug performances depend on the viral genotype. So international recommendations give typing of the virus a prerequisite for treatment choice and patient management. Commercially available HCV genotyping kits are scarce and this analysis is often in-house using tedious PCRs and Sanger sequencing, leading to a lack of standardization. A newly commercialized HCV genotyping assay based on real-time PCR has been developed by Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). We compared this new assay with our in-house PCRs -sequencing technique on 101 regular samples and 81 LiPA failures or low viral load samples. No genotype or 1a/1b subtype mismatch was observed. Two samples were misidentified at the subtype level without clinical impact. Three genotype 1b and two genotype 1a samples with low viral load could not be subtyped. Nevertheless, 13 (13%) samples from the regular panel and 35 (43%) from the more difficult-to-type panels failed to give results on first pass with the Roche kit. Failures were mostly associated with genotype 3 subtype a, with genotype 4 subtype non-a, or with viral loads &amp;lt;200 IU/mL (p = 0.0061). The workflow allowed a non-specialized technician to obtain results in less than 4 hours whereas 2 to 3 days and experienced staff were required with the in-house assay. In conclusion, the Roche cobas&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; HCV GT kit is easy and rapid to use and provides reliable results. The high rate of uninterpretable results particularly for low viral load samples and less frequent genotypes, and the absence of subtyping for non-genotype 1 could require sending complex samples to a specialized laboratory.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194396</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194396</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Evaluation of the cobas&amp;lt;sup&gt;®&amp;lt;/sup&gt; GT hepatitis C virus genotyping assay in G1-6 viruses including low viral loads and LiPA failures</title><fingerprint>219d8986</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Némoz, Léa Roger, Vincent Leroy, Jean-Dominique Poveda, Patrice Morand, Sylvie Larrat&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Inequalities in health among groups of various socio-economic status (as measured by education, occupation, and income) constitute one of the main challenges for public health. Since 2006, the Lazio Regional Outcome Evaluation Program (P.Re.Val.E.), presents a set of indicators of hospital performance based on quality standards driven by strong clinical recommendations, and measures the variation in the access to effective health care for different population groups and providers in the Lazio Region. One of the aims of the program was to compare population subgroups in order to promote equity in service provision. Since June 2013, a new management strategy has been put in place that assigned specific goals based on performance assessment to the chief executive officers of the hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether, in recent years, there has been a reduction in the differential access to effective health care, among individuals with different educational levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We enrolled all patients discharged from both public and private hospitals of the Lazio region between 2012 and 2015, living in Lazio region. We analysed the proportion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes (primary PCI), the proportion of patients with hip fracture (HF) who underwent surgery within 2 days, and the proportion of women with primary C-section. We applied multivariate logistic regression models to assess the effect of educational level on health outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities that could affect the outcomes. For each year of the study period, we compared adjusted proportions of outcomes for the highest and the lowest level of education by using percentage differences.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, 44.6% of STEMI patients (N = 3,299) were treated with primary PCI, 54.4% of patients with hip fractures (N = 6,602) underwent surgery within 2 days, and 27.7% of women without a previous C-section (N = 34,718) delivered via C-section, in 2015. The corresponding proportions in 2012 were 27.8%, 31.3% and 31.5%, respectively. By comparing the adjusted proportions in patients with the highest education level (a university degree or higher) to those with the lowest level education level (None/Primary school), a decrease in the percentage difference was observed during the study period. In STEMI and delivery cohorts, the improvement of outcomes involved the least and the most educated patients, respectively, and the difference between the two educational levels was close to zero in 2015, whereas for hip patients, the improvement was more evident among the less educated patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, we observed a reduction in the differential access to effective heath care by educational level, in different clinical areas. Different factors might explain these results. On top of the public disclosure of outcome data, the management strategy applied in mid-2013 might have driven the overall improvement of the health system for the considered conditions, helping to achieve a fairer access to health.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194972</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194972</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Regional Outcome Evaluation Program (P.Re.Val.E.): Reduction of inequality in access to effective health care in the Lazio region of Italy (2012–2015)</title><fingerprint>bf9aff61</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Ventura, Danilo Fusco, Katia Bontempi, Paola Colais, Marina Davoli&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The molecular characterization of endometrial cancer (EC) can facilitate identification of various tumor subtypes. Although EC patients with &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations reproducibly demonstrate better prognosis, the outcome of patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) remains controversial. This study attempted to interrogate whether genetic stratification of EC can identify distinct subsets with prognostic significance.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A cohort of 138 EC patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent was enrolled. Sanger sequencing was used to evaluate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; genes. MSI analysis was performed using four mononucleotide repeat markers and methylation status of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was measured by a fluorescent bisulfite polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Protein expression for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Extensive hypermethylation of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was observed in 69.6% ECs with MLH1 deficiency and 3.5% with MMR proficiency, but in none of the ECs with loss of other MMR genes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .0001). MSI-positive and &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations were found in 29.0% and 8.7% EC patients, respectively. Our MSI analysis showed a sensitivity of 92.7% for EC patients with MMR deficiency, and a specificity of 97.9% for EC patients with MMR proficiency. In univariate and multivariate analyses, &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations and &lt;i&gt;MSI&lt;/i&gt; status was significantly associated with progression-free survival (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0129 and 0.0064, respectively) but not with endometrial cancer-specific survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study provides significant evidence that analyses of proofreading &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations and MSI status based on mononucleotide repeat markers are potentially useful biomarkers to identify EC patients with better prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195655</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195655</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Clinical impact of endometrial cancer stratified by genetic mutational profiles, &amp;lt;i&gt;POLE&amp;lt;/i&gt; mutation, and microsatellite instability</title><fingerprint>59e4e37f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoko Haruma, Takeshi Nagasaka, Keiichiro Nakamura, Junko Haraga, Akihiro Nyuya, Takeshi Nishida, Ajay Goel, Hisashi Masuyama, Yuji Hiramatsu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects a large number of people throughout the world. Anxiety, depression and fatigue are common symptoms of SLE that substantially contribute to decreased quality of life. This study investigates the interplay between physical and psychiatric manifestations of lupus. To this end, an SLE patient cohort was examined for correlations between clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and psychological indicators.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy-two lupus patients were evaluated for psychological status using a battery of instruments, including assessments for fatigue (CFS &amp;amp; FSS), depression (HADS), anxiety (HADS), overall health (SF-36 &amp;amp; PSQI) and intimate relationship satisfaction (RAS &amp;amp; CSI). Scores from these assessments were correlated with lupus clinical profiles and laboratory test values.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of depression in the SLE patient cohort was 41.7%, as measured by the hospital depression and anxiety scale. The study identified that pain (p = 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.026), Chalder’s fatigue scale (p &amp;lt; 0.001), fatigue severity scale (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001) are all positively correlated with depression in SLE patients. Total complement (CH50) (p = 0.032), and SF-36 physical and mental characteristic assessments are negatively correlated with depression. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the disease related complaint alopecia (p = 0.008) and relationship assessment scale scores (p = 0.004) may also be correlated to depression in SLE patients. Multivariant scrutiny of the clinical and psychosocial characteristics identified the fatigue severity scale (p = 0.026), SF-36 physical function (p = 0.040), physical role function (0.030), and mental health (p = 0.002) as the best indicators directly correlated with depression for the SLE cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results reveal the influence of physical manifestations of lupus including fatigue, pain, body mass index and anxiety, as well as decreased physical and mental function, on depression. Fatigue is the strongest factor correlated with depression in SLE patients in the cohort. Both physical and social/psychological aspects likely contribute to the depression and anxiety in lupus.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195579</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195579</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Correlation between physical markers and psychiatric health in a Portuguese systemic lupus erythematosus cohort: The role of suffering in chronic autoimmune disease</title><fingerprint>14635716</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Margarida Figueiredo-Braga, Caleb Cornaby, Miguel Bernardes, Marta Figueiredo, Cristina Dos Santos Mesquita, Lúcia Costa, Brian D.

In cases of natural disasters, epidemics or even in dangerous situations like an act of terrorism, battle fields, a shooting or a mountain accident, finding survivors is a challenge. In these kind of situations it is sometimes critical to know if a person has vital signs or not, without the need to be in contact with the victim, thus avoiding jeopardizing the lives of the rescue workers. In this work, we propose the use of video magnification techniques to detect small movements in human bodies due to breathing that are invisible to the naked eye. Two different video magnification techniques, intensity-based and phase-based, were tested. The utility of these techniques to detect people who are alive but injured in risk situations was verified by simulating a scene with three people involved in an accident. Several factors such as camera stability, distance to the object, light conditions, magnification factor or computing time were analyzed. The results obtained were quite positive for both techniques, intensity-based method proving more adequate if the interest is in almost instant results whereas the phase-based method is more appropriate if processing time is not so relevant but the degree of magnification without excessive image noise.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195290</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195290</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Detection of human vital signs in hazardous environments by means of video magnification</title><fingerprint>76a1cb83</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Celestino Ordóñez, Carlos Cabo, Agustín Menéndez, Antonio Bello&lt;/p&gt;

The usefulness of a diagnostic workup for occult cancer in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) is controversial. We used the RIETE (Registro Informatizado Enfermedad Trombo Embólica) database to perform a nested case-control study to validate a prognostic score that identifies patients with unprovoked VTE at increased risk for cancer. We dichotomized patients as having low- (≤2 points) or high (≥3 points) risk for cancer, and tried to validate the score at 12 and 24 months. From January 2014 to October 2016, 11,695 VTE patients were recruited. Of these, 1,360 with unprovoked VTE (11.6%) were eligible for the study. At 12 months, 52 patients (3.8%; 95%CI: 2.9–5%) were diagnosed with cancer. Among 905 patients (67%) scoring ≤2 points, 22 (2.4%) had cancer. Among 455 scoring ≥3 points, 30 (6.6%) had cancer (hazard ratio 2.8; 95%CI 1.6–5; p&amp;lt;0.01). C-statistic was 0.63 (95%CI 0.55–0.71). At 24 months, 58 patients (4.3%; 95%CI: 3.3–5.5%) were diagnosed with cancer. Among 905 patients scoring ≤2 points, 26 (2.9%) had cancer. Among 455 patients scoring ≥3 points, 32 (7%) had cancer (hazard ratio 2.6; 95%CI 1.5–4.3; p&amp;lt;0.01). C-statistic was 0.61 (95%CI, 0.54–0.69). We validated our prognostic score at 12 and 24 months, although prospective cohort validation is needed. This may help to identify patients for whom more extensive screening workup may be required.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194673</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194673</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Validation of a prognostic score for hidden cancer in unprovoked venous thromboembolism</title><fingerprint>d1586273</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luis Jara-Palomares, Remedios Otero, David Jimenez, Juan Manuel Praena-Fernandez, Carme Font, Conxita Falga, Silvia Soler, David Riesco, Peter Verhamme, Manuel Monreal, on behalf of RIETE Registry &lt;/p&gt;

This may help to identify patients for whom more extensive screening workup may be required.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194673</canonicalUrl><updated>1521579600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37bd:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301085v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Kianfar, K.</name></author><description>Finding approximate occurrences of a pattern in a text using a full-text index is a central problem in bioinformatics and has been extensively researched.

A number of different genetics-based vector control methods have been proposed. Two approaches currently under development in &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes are the two-locus engineered underdominance and killer-rescue gene drive systems. Each of these is theoretically capable of increasing in frequency within a population, thus spreading associated desirable genetic traits. Thus they have gained attention for their potential to aid in the fight against various mosquito-vectored diseases. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. it is self-sustaining) whilst in the killer-rescue system the rescue component should initially increase in frequency (while the lethal component (killer) is common) before eventually declining (when the killer is rare) and being eliminated (i.e. it is temporally self-limiting). The population genetics of both systems have been explored using discrete generation mathematical models. The effects of various ecological factors on these two systems have also been considered using alternative modelling methodologies. Here we formulate and analyse new mathematical models combining the population dynamics and population genetics of these two classes of gene drive that incorporate ecological factors not previously studied and are simple enough to allow the effects of each to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on the potential effects that may be obtained as a result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; and the relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared with their wild-type counterparts. We also extend our models to consider population dynamics in two demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal between neighbouring populations on the outcome of UD and KR gene drive systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3QzCHPdoiAg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1521838800000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16253fa0281:3c81d8:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. Controversies still exist over the relationship between hyponatremia and outcomes of hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To analyze the association of low serum sodium levels at hospital admission with in-hospital mortality and patient disposition and to compare the distribution of the risk of death associated with hyponatremia across the lifespan of hospitalized patients, we conducted an observational study of 2.3 million patients using data extracted from the Cerner Health Facts database between 2000 and 2014. Logistic regression models were used in the analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At hospital admission 14.4% of hospitalized patients had serum sodium levels [Na] &amp;lt;135 mEq/L. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, we found that the risk of in-hospital mortality significantly increases for [Na] levels &amp;lt; 135 or ≥143 to ≤145 mEq/L compared to the reference interval of 140 to &amp;lt;143 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001). We observed similar trends for the relationship between [Na] levels and discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility. We demonstrated that younger age groups (18 to &amp;lt;45, 45 to &amp;lt;65) had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to older age groups (65 to &amp;lt;75, ≥75) for [Na] levels &amp;lt;130 mEq/L or 143 to ≤145 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is common among hospitalized patients and is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility. The risk of death and other outcomes was more evident for [Na] &amp;lt;135 mEq/L.

Background &lt;p&gt;The comparison between long acting insulin analogues (LAIA) and human insulin (NPH) has been investigated for decades, with many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews giving mixed results. This overlapping and contradictory evidence has increased uncertainty on coverage decisions at health systems level.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To conduct an overview of systematic reviews and update existing reviews, preparing new meta-analysis to determine whether LAIA are effective for T1D patients compared to NPH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified systematic reviews of RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of LAIA glargine or detemir, compared to NPH insulin for T1D, assessing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and hypoglycemia. Data sources included Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and hand-searching. The methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by two reviewers, using AMSTAR and Jadad scale. We found 11 eligible systematic reviews that contained a total of 25 relevant clinical trials. Two reviewers independently abstracted data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found evidence that LAIA are efficacious compared to NPH, with estimates showing a reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia episodes (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.57; 0.76) and A1C (95% CI 0.23; 0.12). No significance was found related to severe hypoglycemia (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.71; 1.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study design has allowed us to carry out the most comprehensive assessment of RCTs on this subject, filling a gap in diabetes research.

Our paper addresses a question that is important not only for decision makers but also for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194801</canonicalUrl><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc712c:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020144?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Max Buchholz</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020144?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020144?af=R</link><published>1521513212000</published><title>Simplified approach to the mixed time-averaging semiclassical initial value representation for the calculation of dense vibrational spectra</title><fingerprint>5dcfdf2c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1625704c351:4c87b8c:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1521878352721</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3362.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Yuxi Liu, Shane Gonen, Tamir Gonen, Todd O.

Here, we implement GERAS (GEnetic Reference for Age of Single-cell), a machine learning based framework capable of assigning individual cells to chronological stages based on their transcriptomes. GERAS displays greater than 90% accuracy in classifying the chronological stage of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells. The framework demonstrates robustness against biological and technical noise, as evaluated by its performance on independent samplings of single-cells. Additionally, GERAS determines the impact of differences in calorie intake and BMI on the aging of zebrafish and human pancreatic cells, respectively. We further harness the predictive power of GERAS to identify genome-wide molecular factors that correlate with aging. We show that one of these factors, junb, is necessary to maintain the proliferative state of juvenile beta-cells.

The processes regulating peripheral naive T-cell numbers and clonal diversity remain poorly understood. Conceptually, homeostatic mechanisms must fall into the broad categories of neutral (simple random birth–death models), competition (regulation of cell numbers through quorum-sensing, perhaps via limiting shared resources), adaptation (involving cell-intrinsic changes in homeostatic fitness, defined as net growth rate over time), or selection (involving the loss or outgrowth of cell populations deriving from intercellular variation in fitness). There may also be stably maintained heterogeneity within the naive T-cell pool. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we confront very general models of these processes with an array of experimental data, both new and published. While reduced competition for homeostatic stimuli may impact cell survival or proliferation in neonates or under moderate to severe lymphopenia, we show that the only mechanism capable of explaining multiple, independent experimental studies of naive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell homeostasis in mice from young adulthood into old age is one of adaptation, in which cells act independently and accrue a survival or proliferative advantage continuously with their post-thymic age. However, aged naive T cells may also be functionally impaired, and so the accumulation of older cells via ‘conditioning through experience’ may contribute to reduced immune responsiveness in the elderly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_sQDfPObu6Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523480400000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162b5d1647d:50b536:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanket Rane, Thea Hogan, Benedict Seddon, Andrew J.

major challenge in synthetic biology, particularly for mammalian systems, is

Control at the transcriptional level can be achieved by adaptation of bacterial
repressor-operator systems (e.g. TetR), but altering the activity of a protein
by controlling transcription is indirect and for longer half-life mRNAs,
decreasing activity this way can be inconveniently slow. Where possible, direct
modulation of protein activity by soluble ligands has many advantages,

have uncovered detailed information on the interactions between large numbers
of small molecules and their primary protein targets (as well as off-target

resource for synthetic biology. Here we present SynPharm, a tool that draws
together information from the pharmacological database GtoPdb and the
structural database, PDB, to help synthetic biologists identify ligand-binding
domains of natural proteins. Consequently, as sequence cassettes, these may be
suitable for building into engineered proteins to confer small molecule

include; assessing contact changes between different ligands in the same
protein, predicting possible effects of genetic variants on binding residues
and insights into ligand cross-reactivity between species.</description><engagement>3</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/An_open-access_tool_for_designing_drug_control_into_engineered_proteins/6106541</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>A

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury still represents a major concern in clinical transplantation, especially in the era of extreme organ shortage and extended criteria donor organs. In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240–340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;RIC 1 group showed significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Limb remote ischemic conditioning of the recipient protects the liver in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation</title><fingerprint>968614f6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zoltan Czigany, Christian Bleilevens, Christian Beckers, Christian Stoppe, Michaela Möhring, Andras Fülöp, Attila Szijarto, Georg Lurje, Ulf P.

Assessment of researchers is necessary for decisions of hiring, promotion, and tenure. A burgeoning number of scientific leaders believe the current system of faculty incentives and rewards is misaligned with the needs of society and disconnected from the evidence about the causes of the reproducibility crisis and suboptimal quality of the scientific publication record. To address this issue, particularly for the clinical and life sciences, we convened a 22-member expert panel workshop in Washington, DC, in January 2017. Twenty-two academic leaders, funders, and scientists participated in the meeting. As background for the meeting, we completed a selective literature review of 22 key documents critiquing the current incentive system. From each document, we extracted how the authors perceived the problems of assessing science and scientists, the unintended consequences of maintaining the status quo for assessing scientists, and details of their proposed solutions. The resulting table was used as a seed for participant discussion. This resulted in six principles for assessing scientists and associated research and policy implications. We hope the content of this paper will serve as a basis for establishing best practices and redesigning the current approaches to assessing scientists by the many players involved in that process.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oSr6VqA7_WQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16272e5d344:b6d4a:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Moher, Florian Naudet, Ioana A.

With over 1 million species on earth, each biologically unique, do we have any hope of understanding whether species will persist in a warming world? We might, because it turns out that there is surprising regularity in how warming accelerates the major metabolic processes that power life. A persistent challenge has been to understand ecological effects of temperature in the context of species interactions, especially when individuals not only experience temperature but also mortality due to parasitism or predation. Kirk et al. have shown how the effects of parasites vary with warming in a manner entirely consistent with general temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/u5e7Nju7vII&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522702800000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16287756338:cba3d:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mary I.

Recently, alignment-free methods based on kmer composition have proven their ability to explore the accessory genome. However, they lead to redundant descriptions and results which are hard to interpret. Methods: Here, we introduce DBGWAS, an extended kmer-based GWAS method producing interpretable genetic variants associated with phenotypes. Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes identified by the association model into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is fast, alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. It produces annotated subgraphs representing local polymorphisms as well as mobile genetic elements (MGE) and offers a graphical framework to interpret GWAS results. Results: We validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - along with their MGE context. It also enabled us to formulate new hypotheses involving genetic variants not yet described in the antibiotic resistance literature. Conclusion: Our novel method proved its efficiency to retrieve any type of phenotype-associated genetic variant without prior knowledge. All experiments were computed in less than two hours and reported a compact set of meaningful subgraphs, thereby outperforming other GWAS approaches and facilitating the interpretation of the results.

Despite the double burden of infectious and chronic non-communicable diseases in Africa, health care expenditure disproportionately favours infectious diseases. In this paper, we examine quantitatively the extent of this disproportionate access to diagnoses and treatment of diabetes, hypertension and malaria in Ghana. A total of 220 health facilities was surveyed across the country in 2011. Findings indicate that diagnoses and treatment of infectious diseases were more accessible than NCDs. In terms of treatment, 78% and 87% of health facilities had two of the recommended malaria drugs while less than 35% had essential diabetes and hypertension drugs. There is a significant unmet need for diagnoses and treatment of NCDs in Ghana. These inequities have implications for high morbidity and mortality from NCDs. We recommend the use of task shifting as a model to increase the delivery of NCD services.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194677</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194677</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>The double burden of disease and the challenge of health access: Evidence from Access, Bottlenecks, Cost and Equity facility survey in Ghana</title><fingerprint>a3e5b8bd</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mawuli Komla Kushitor, Sandra Boatemaa&lt;/p&gt;

Plastic pollution has been well documented in natural environments, including the open waters and sediments within lakes and rivers, the open ocean and even the air, but less attention has been paid to synthetic polymers in human consumables. Since multiple toxicity studies indicate risks to human health when plastic particles are ingested, more needs to be known about the presence and abundance of anthropogenic particles in human foods and beverages. This study investigates the presence of anthropogenic particles in 159 samples of globally sourced tap water, 12 brands of Laurentian Great Lakes beer, and 12 brands of commercial sea salt. Of the tap water samples analyzed, 81% were found to contain anthropogenic particles. The majority of these particles were fibers (98.3%) between 0.1–5 mm in length. The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99% were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg. Based on consumer guidelines, our results indicate the average person ingests over 5,800 particles of synthetic debris from these three sources annually, with the largest contribution coming from tap water (88%).</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Anthropogenic contamination of tap water, beer, and sea salt</title><fingerprint>c135152e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mary Kosuth, Sherri A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine during short-term treatment in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a comprehensive literature review of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials databases for randomized controlled trials(RCTs) comparing duloxetine or duloxetine plus other antipsychotics with placebo for the treatment of GAD in adults. Outcome measures were (1) efficacy, assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) anxiety subscale score, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety(HAM-A) psychic and somatic anxiety factor scores, and response and remission rates based on total scores of HAM-A; (2) tolerability, assessed by discontinuation rate due to adverse events, the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events(TEAEs) and serious adverse events(SAEs). Review Manager 5.3 and Stata Version 12.0 software were used for all statistical analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis included 8 RCTs. Mean changes in the HADS anxiety subscale score [mean difference(MD) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval(CI) 1.77–2.88, P&amp;lt;0.00001] and HAM-A psychic anxiety factor score were significantly greater in patients with GAD that received duloxetine compared to those that received placebo (MD = 2.15, 95%CI 1.61–2.68, P&amp;lt;0.00001). However, there was no difference in mean change in the HAM-A somatic anxiety factor score (MD = 1.13, 95%CI 0.67–1.58, P&amp;lt;0.00001). Discontinuation rate due to AEs in the duloxetine group was significantly higher than the placebo group [odds ratio(OR) = 2.62, 95%CI 1.35–5.06, P = 0.004]. The incidence of any TEAE was significantly increased in patients that received duloxetine (OR = 1.76, 95%CI 1.36–2.28, P&amp;lt;0.0001), but there was no significant difference in the incidence of SAEs (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 0.52–2.47, P = 0.75).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Duloxetine resulted in a greater improvement in symptoms of psychic anxiety and similar changes in symptoms of somatic anxiety compared to placebo during short-term treatment in adults with GAD and its tolerability was acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194501</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194501</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Efficacy and tolerability of short-term duloxetine treatment in adults with generalized anxiety disorder: A meta-analysis</title><fingerprint>b54c3670</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xinyuan Li, Lijun Zhu, Chunkui Zhou, Jing Liu, Heqian Du, Chenglin Wang, Shaokuan Fang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ≥15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults. However, older adults have a higher all-cause mortality rate, perhaps partially driven by late presentation to care. Enhanced outreach and care to this group is imperative to improve their outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194047</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194047</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Retention in care among older adults living with HIV in western Kenya: A retrospective observational cohort study</title><fingerprint>ed8f8d28</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jepchirchir Kiplagat, Ann Mwangi, Alfred Keter, Paula Braitstein, Edwin Sang, Joel Negin, Charles Chasela&lt;/p&gt;

Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults. However, older adults have a higher all-cause mortality rate, perhaps partially driven by late presentation to care. Enhanced outreach and care to this group is imperative to improve their outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194047</canonicalUrl><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad280f:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195431</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Chris R.

Background &lt;p&gt;HIV prevalence varies from 1.7% to 14.8% between ethnic groups in Uganda. Understanding the factors responsible for this heterogeneity in HIV spread may guide prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the relationship between HIV prevalence by ethnic group and a range of risk factors as well as the prevalence of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), syphilis and symptomatic STIs in the 2004/2005 Uganda HIV/AIDS Sero-Behavioural Survey—a two stage, nationally representative, population based survey of 15–59-year-olds.

Understanding determinants shaping infection risk of endangered wildlife is a major topic in conservation medicine. The proboscis monkey, &lt;i&gt;Nasalis larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic primate flagship species for conservation in Borneo, is endangered through habitat loss, but can still be found in riparian lowland and mangrove forests, and in some protected areas. To assess socioecological and anthropogenic influence on intestinal helminth infections in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, 724 fecal samples of harem and bachelor groups, varying in size and the number of juveniles, were collected between June and October 2012 from two study sites in Malaysian Borneo: 634 samples were obtained from groups inhabiting the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS), 90 samples were collected from groups of the Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary (LBPMS), where monkeys are fed on stationary feeding platforms. Parasite risk was quantified by intestinal helminth prevalence, host parasite species richness (PSR), and eggs per gram feces (epg). Generalized linear mixed effect models were applied to explore whether study site, group type, group size, the number of juveniles per group, and sampling month predict parasite risk. At the LBPMS, prevalence and epg of &lt;i&gt;Trichuris&lt;/i&gt; spp., strongylids, and &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. but not &lt;i&gt;Ascaris&lt;/i&gt; spp., as well as host PSR were significantly elevated. Only for &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp., prevalence showed significant changes between months; at both sites, the beginning rainy season with increased precipitation was linked to higher prevalence, suggesting the external life cycle of &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. to benefit from humidity. Higher prevalence, epgs, and PSR within the LBPMS suggest that anthropogenic factors shape host infection risk more than socioecological factors, most likely via higher re-infection rates and chronic stress. Noninvasive measurement of fecal parasite stages is an important tool for assessing transmission dynamics and infection risks for endangered tropical wildlife. Findings will contribute to healthcare management in nature and in anthropogenically managed environments.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195584</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195584</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Fecal parasite risk in the endangered proboscis monkey is higher in an anthropogenically managed forest environment compared to a riparian rain forest in Sabah, Borneo</title><fingerprint>d13e25d3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Annette Klaus, Christina Strube, Kathrin Monika Röper, Ute Radespiel, Frank Schaarschmidt, Senthilvel Nathan, Benoit Goossens, Elke Zimmermann&lt;/p&gt;

Several studies highlighted the relevance of extrinsic noise in shaping cell decision making and differentiation in molecular networks. Bimodal distributions of gene expression levels provide experimental evidence of phenotypic differentiation, where the modes of the distribution often correspond to different physiological states of the system. We theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this interaction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target transcription rate almost no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We investigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a fluctuating miRNA-transcription rate. We find that the presence of extrinsic noise favours the presence of bimodal target distributions which can be observed for a wider range of parameters compared to the case with intrinsic noise only and for lower miRNA-target interaction strength. Our results suggest that combining threshold-inducing interactions with extrinsic noise provides a simple and robust mechanism for obtaining bimodal populations without requiring fine tuning. Furthermore, we characterise the protein distribution’s dependence on protein half-life.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kcCJaIvDnzk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523998800000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d4ba762b:4bed5c:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Del Giudice, Stefano Bo, Silvia Grigolon, Carla Bosia&lt;/p&gt;

The assessment of competitive movement demands in team sports has traditionally relied upon global positioning system (GPS) analyses presented as fixed-time epochs (e.g., 5–40 min). More recently, presenting game data as a rolling average has become prevalent due to concerns over a loss of sampling resolution associated with the windowing of data over fixed periods. Accordingly, this study compared rolling average (ROLL) and fixed-time (FIXED) epochs for quantifying the peak movement demands of international rugby union match-play as a function of playing position. Elite players from three different squads (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 119) were monitored using 10 Hz GPS during 36 matches played in the 2014–2017 seasons. Players categorised broadly as forwards and backs, and then by positional sub-group (FR: front row, SR: second row, BR: back row, HB: half back, MF: midfield, B3: back three) were monitored during match-play for peak values of high-speed running (&gt;5 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; HSR) and relative distance covered (m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) over 60–300 s using two types of sample-epoch (ROLL, FIXED). Irrespective of the method used, as the epoch length increased, values for the intensity of running actions decreased (e.g., For the backs using the ROLL method, distance covered decreased from 177.4 ± 20.6 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 60 s epoch to 107.5 ± 13.3 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the 300 s epoch). For the team as a whole, and irrespective of position, estimates of fixed effects indicated significant between-method differences across all time-points for both relative distance covered and HSR. Movement demands were underestimated consistently by FIXED versus ROLL with differences being most pronounced using 60 s epochs (95% CI HSR: -6.05 to -4.70 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 95% CI distance: -18.45 to -16.43 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For all HSR time epochs except one, all backs groups increased more (p &amp;lt; 0.01) from FIXED to ROLL than the forward groups. Linear mixed modelling of ROLL data highlighted that for HSR (except 60 s epoch), SR was the only group not significantly different to FR. For relative distance covered all other position groups were greater than the FR (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The FIXED method underestimated both relative distance (~11%) and HSR values (up to ~20%) compared to the ROLL method. These differences were exaggerated for the HSR variable in the backs position who covered the greatest HSR distance; highlighting important consideration for those implementing the FIXED method of analysis. The data provides coaches with a worst-case scenario reference on the running demands required for periods of 60–300 s in length. This information offers novel insight into game demands and can be used to inform the design of training games to increase specificity of preparation for the most demanding phases of matches.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195197</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195197</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Assessing worst case scenarios in movement demands derived from global positioning systems during international rugby union matches: Rolling averages versus fixed length epochs</title><fingerprint>12889cec</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel J.

are commonly used in untargeted metabolomics, providing retention time, m/z
values and metabolite specific-fragments all of which are used to identify and validate
an unknown analyte. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is emerging as an
enhancement to classic xC-MS strategies, by offering additional separation as
well as collision cross section (CCS) determination. In order to apply such an
approach to a synthetic biology workflow, verified data from metabolite
standards is necessary. In this work we present experimental DTCCSN2
values for a range of metabolites in positive and negative ionisation modes
using drift time-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (DT-IM-MS) with nitrogen as the
buffer gas. Creating a useful database containing DTCCSN2
measurements for application in metabolite identification relies on a robust
technique that acquires measurements of high reproducibility. We report that 86%
of the metabolites measured in replicate have a relative standard deviation
lower than 0.2 %. Examples of
metabolites with near identical mass are demonstrated to be separated by ion
mobility with over 4% difference in DTCCSN2 values. We conclude
that the integration of ion mobility into current LC-MS workflows can aid in
small molecule identification for both targeted and untargeted metabolite
screening which is commonly performed in synthetic biology.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Mobilising_Ion_Mobility_Mass_Spectrometry_in_a_Synthetic_Biology_Analytics_Workflow/6149204</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Chromatography based mass spectrometry approaches (xC-MS)

Global introductions of aquatic species and their associated pathogens are threatening worldwide biodiversity. The introduction of two North American crayfish species, &lt;i&gt;Procambarus clarkii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pacifastacus leniusculus&lt;/i&gt;, into Japan in 1927 seems to have negatively affected native Japanese crayfish populations of &lt;i&gt;Cambaroides japonicus&lt;/i&gt;. Several studies have shown the decline of these native populations due to competition, predation and habitat colonization by the two invasive North American crayfish species. Here, we identify an additional factor contributing to this decline. We report the first crayfish plague outbreaks in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonicus&lt;/i&gt; populations in Japan, which were diagnosed using both histological and molecular approaches (analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region). Subsequent analyses of the mitochondrial ribosomal rnnS and rnnL regions of diseased specimens indicate that these outbreaks originated from a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt; population and identify a novel haplotype of &lt;i&gt;Aphanomyces astaci&lt;/i&gt;, d3-haplotype, hosted by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt;. Overall, our findings demonstrate the first two cases of crayfish plague in Japan, and the first case in a non-European native crayfish species, which originated from the red swamp crayfish &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt;. This finding is a matter of concern for the conservation of the native freshwater species of Japan and also highlights the risk of introducing crayfish carrier species into biogeographic regions harboring species susceptible to the crayfish plague.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195353</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195353</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Crayfish plague in Japan: A real threat to the endemic &amp;lt;i&gt;Cambaroides japonicus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>118c0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Martín-Torrijos, Tadashi Kawai, Jenny Makkonen, Japo Jussila, Harri Kokko, Javier Diéguez-Uribeondo&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings could be an important breakthrough in the design of OGT specific and/or AchE OGT dual inhibitors.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/303040</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162d81eb3ba:39b8de2:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1524044313530</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024219?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Ravishankar Sundararaman</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024219?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024219?af=R</link><published>1523415260000</published><title>Improving accuracy of electrochemical capacitance and solvation energetics in first-principles calculations</title><fingerprint>4946137d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162c30cf7b9:1b85305:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523690829753</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023170?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Alberto Ambrosetti</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023170?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023170?af=R</link><published>1522907148000</published><title>Anomalous van der Waals-Casimir interactions on graphene: A concerted effect of temperature, retardation, and non-locality</title><fingerprint>ebf03306</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b62:7c9981b6</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195111</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Omid Rasouli</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Omid Rasouli, Ottar Vasseljen, Egil A.

As many similar symptoms are reported in fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), underlying defcits may potentially also be similar. Postural disequilibrium reported in both conditions may thus be explained by similar deviations in postural control strategies. 75 females (25/group FM, CFS and control, age 19–49 years) performed 60 s of quiet standing on a force platform in each of three conditions: 1) firm surface with vision, 2) firm surface without vision and, 3) compliant surface with vision. Migration of center of pressure was decomposed into a slow and a fast component denoting postural sway and lateral forces controlling postural sway, analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Main effects of group for the antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions showed that patients displayed larger amplitudes (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.021) and lower frequencies (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) for the slow component, as well as for the fast component (amplitudes: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001 and frequencies: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029) compared to controls. Post hoc analyses showed no significant differences between patient groups. In conclusion, both the CFS- and the FM-group differed from the control group. Larger postural sway and insufficient control was found in patients compared to controls, with no significant differences between the two patient groups.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195111</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195111</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Lower regulatory frequency for postural control in patients with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome</title><fingerprint>1c1055c0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Omid Rasouli, Ottar Vasseljen, Egil A.

Wind has a significant effect on the control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), resulting in changes in their ground speed and direction, which has an important influence on the results of integrated optimization of UAV task allocation and path planning. The objective of this integrated optimization problem changes from minimizing flight distance to minimizing flight time. In this study, the Euclidean distance between any two targets is expanded to the Dubins path length, considering the minimum turning radius of fixed-wing UAVs. According to the vector relationship between wind speed, UAV airspeed, and UAV ground speed, a method is proposed to calculate the flight time of UAV between targets. On this basis, a variable-speed Dubins path vehicle routing problem (VS-DP-VRP) model is established with the purpose of minimizing the time required for UAVs to visit all the targets and return to the starting point. By designing a crossover operator and mutation operator, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, the results of which show that an effective UAV task allocation and path planning solution under steady wind can be provided.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Integrated optimization of unmanned aerial vehicle task allocation and path planning under steady wind</title><fingerprint>5e6e4f2a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by He Luo, Zhengzheng Liang, Moning Zhu, Xiaoxuan Hu, Guoqiang Wang&lt;/p&gt;

The existing protein complex detection methods can be broadly divided into two categories: unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Most of the unsupervised learning methods assume that protein complexes are in dense regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks even though many true complexes are not dense subgraphs. Supervised learning methods utilize the informative properties of known complexes; they often extract features from existing complexes and then use the features to train a classification model. The trained model is used to guide the search process for new complexes. However, insufficient extracted features, noise in the PPI data and the incompleteness of complex data make the classification model imprecise. Consequently, the classification model is not sufficient for guiding the detection of complexes. Therefore, we propose a new robust score function that combines the classification model with local structural information. Based on the score function, we provide a search method that works both forwards and backwards. The results from experiments on six benchmark PPI datasets and three protein complex datasets show that our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for protein complex detection, occasionally significantly outperforming such methods.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194124</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194124</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Predicting protein complexes using a supervised learning method combined with local structural information</title><fingerprint>608c2992</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yadong Dong, Yongqi Sun, Chao Qin&lt;/p&gt;

During the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century the discussion on early human behavioral patterns revolved around the &lt;i&gt;hunting versus scavenging&lt;/i&gt; debate. The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks– 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores–were virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194324</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194324</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Differentiating percussion pits and carnivore tooth pits using 3D reconstructions and geometric morphometrics</title><fingerprint>a2c9073e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by José Yravedra, Julia Aramendi, Miguel Ángel Maté-González, Lloyd Austin Courtenay, Diego González-Aguilera&lt;/p&gt;

Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194324</canonicalUrl><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2819:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/157?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>Kimble, J.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/157?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/157?rss=1</link><published>1523554635000</published><title>John Sulston (1942-2018)</title><fingerprint>cb24f62a</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/157.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fecea4:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Junchao Cai</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/T66k2hUTN34/ncomms16196</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196</link><published>1522393200000</published><title>Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC</title><fingerprint>e5ca8a41</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16196&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/T66k2hUTN34&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162764edef1:7865ba5:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16196&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/T66k2hUTN34&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1522403303153</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/104034v4?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Steinegger, M.</name></author><description>Metagenomic datasets contain billions of protein sequences that could greatly enhance large-scale functional annotation and structure prediction.

Background &lt;p&gt;Research investigating Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) has largely focused on the cervical spine yet symptoms can be widespread. Thoracic spine pain prevalence is reported ~66%; perhaps unsurprising given the forceful stretch/eccentric loading of posterior structures of the spine, and the thoracic spine’s contribution to neck mobility/function. Approximately 50% WAD patients develop chronic pain and disability resulting in high levels of societal and healthcare costs. It is time to look beyond the cervical spine to fully understand anatomical dysfunction in WAD and provide new directions for clinical practice and research.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the scope and nature of dysfunction in the thoracic region in patients with WAD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review and data synthesis was conducted according to a pre-defined, registered (PROSPERO, CRD42015026983) and published protocol. All forms of observational study were included. A sensitive topic-based search strategy was designed from inception to 1/06/16. Databases, grey literature and registers were searched using a study population terms and key words derived from scoping search. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third reviewer checked for consistency and clarity. Extracted data included summary data: sample size and characteristics, outcomes, and timescales to reflect disorder state. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were tabulated to allow enabling a semi-qualitative comparison and grouped by outcome across studies. Strength of the overall body of evidence was assessed using a modified GRADE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty eight studies (n&gt;50,000) which were conducted across a range of countries were included. Few authors responded to requests for further data (5 of 9 contacted). Results were reported in the context of overall quality and were presented for measures of pain or dysfunction and presented, where possible, according to WAD severity and time point post injury. Key findings include: 1) high prevalence of thoracic pain (&gt;60%); higher for those with more severe presentations and in the acute stage, 2) low prevalence of chest pain (&amp;lt;22%), 3) evidence of thoracic outlet syndrome, with some association to and involvement of the brachial plexus, 4) muscle dysfunction in the form of heightened activity of the sternocleidomastoid or delayed onset of action of the serratus anterior, 5) high prevalence of myofascial pain and trigger points in the scalene muscles, sternocleidomastoid and mid/lower fibres of trapezius muscle (48–65%), and 6) inconclusive evidence of altered thoracic posture or mobility.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence supports thoracic pain and dysfunction in patients with WAD, involving primarily nerves and muscles. Notwithstanding the low/very low level of evidence from this review, our findings do support a more extensive clinical evaluation of patients presenting with WAD. Additional high quality research is required to further characterise dysfunction across other structures in the thoracic region, including but not limited to the thoracic spine (mobility and posture) and thoracic muscles (stiffness, activation patterns). In turn this may inform the design of clinical trials targeting such dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194235</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194235</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Thoracic dysfunction in whiplash associated disorders: A systematic review</title><fingerprint>9195ced1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicola R.

Background &amp;amp; aims &lt;p&gt;To determine the prognostic potential of classic and novel serologic antibodies regarding unfavorable disease course in a prospective ulcerative colitis (UC) patient cohort, since few and conflicting data are available in the literature regarding this matter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;187 consecutive patients were studied prospectively (median follow-up: 135 months) from a single referral IBD center in Hungary. Sera were tested for different IgA/IgG type autoantibodies (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic [ANCA], anti-DNA-bound-lactoferrin [anti-LFS], anti-goblet cell [anti-GAB] and anti-pancreatic [PAB: anti-CUZD1 and anti-GP2)]) by indirect immunofluorescence technique and for anti-microbial (anti-&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; [ASCA] IgG/IgA and anti-OMP Plus&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; IgA) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 73.6%, 62.4% and 11.2% of UC patients were positive for IgA/IgG type of atypical perinuclear-ANCA, anti-LFS and anti-GAB, respectively. Occurrences of PABs were 9.6%, while ASCA IgA/IgG and anti-OMP IgA were 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Antibody status was stable over time. IgA type PABs were more prevalent in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (37.5% vs. 4.7% for anti-CUZD1 and 12.5% vs. 0% for anti-GP2, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; for both). IgA type ASCA and anti-CUZD1 antibodies were associated with higher risk of requirement for long-term immunosuppressant therapy in Kaplan-Meier analysis (pLogRank &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt; for both). However, in multivariate Cox-regression analysis only ASCA IgA (HR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.46–5.14, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;) remained independent predictor.

The high risk of experiencing domestic violence (DV) among married women in India who reside in slum communities underscores the need for effective, evidence-based, and culturally-tailored primary prevention. To inform such DV primary prevention strategies for this population, we herein aimed to identify correlates of DV experience in early marriage. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, potential correlates of DV experience were explored among a geographically-clustered random sample of 100 recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India. In multivariable regression, DV experience was associated with less educational attainment by the participant’s spouse (standardized β = -0.281, p = 0.004), less satisfaction of the spouse’s family with the &lt;i&gt;maanpaan&lt;/i&gt; (wedding-related gifts provided by the bride’s family) they received at the time of marriage (standardized β = -0.298, p&amp;lt;0.001), poorer conflict negotiation skills (standardized β = -0.308, p&amp;lt;0.001), and greater acknowledgement of DV occurrence in family and friends (standardized β = 0.436, p&amp;lt;0.001). These correlates suggest strategies that could be incorporated into future DV primary prevention interventions for this vulnerable population (i.e. promoting completion of formal education of boys alongside girls, mitigating causes of familial dowry harassment, improving conflict negotiation skills, and challenging norms surrounding DV).</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195152</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195152</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Correlates of domestic violence experience among recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India</title><fingerprint>44227742</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ameeta S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Diagnosing HIV and/or TB is not sufficient; linkage to care and treatment is conditional to reduce the burden of disease. This study aimed to determine factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based services in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected data from clients who utilized stand-alone (fixed site not attached to a health facility) and mobile HIV testing services in eight communities in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan district, between January 2008 and June 2012. Clients were included in the analysis if they were ≥12 years and had a known HIV status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to assess the association between determinants (sex, age, HIV testing service and co-infection status) and self-reported linkage to HIV care and/or TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Linkage to HIV care was 3 738/5 929 (63.1%). Linkage to HIV care was associated with the type of HIV testing service. Clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services had a significantly reduced odds of linking to HIV care (aOR 0.7 (CI 95%: 0.6–0.8), p&amp;lt;0.001. Linkage to TB treatment was 210/275 (76.4%). Linkage to TB treatment was not associated with sex and service type, but was associated with age. Clients in older age groups were less likely to link to TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years (all, p-value&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A large proportion of clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services did not link to care. Almost a quarter of clients diagnosed with TB did not link to treatment. Integrated community-based HIV and TB testing services are efficient in diagnosing HIV and TB, but strategies to improve linkage to care are required to control these epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195208</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195208</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based HIV testing services in Cape Town, South Africa</title><fingerprint>68002b94</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sue-Ann Meehan, Rosa Sloot, Heather R.

On the performance side, efficient algorithms have been developed, and parallelized on public clouds. On the privacy side, since genomic data are utterly sensitive, several cryptographic mechanisms have been proposed to align reads securely, with a lower performance than the former, which in turn are not secure. This manuscript proposes a novel contribution to improving the privacy X performance product in current genomic studies. Building on recent works that argue that genomics data needsto be treated according to a threat-risk analysis, we introduce a multi-level sensitivity classification of genomic variations. Our classification prevents the amplification of possible privacy attacks, thanks to promoting and partitioning mechanisms among sensitivity levels. Thanks to this classification, reads can be aligned, stored, and later accessed, using different security levels. We then extend a recent filter, which detects the reads that carry sensitive information, to classify reads into sensitivity levels. Finally, based on a review of the existing alignment methods, we show that adapting alignment algorithms to reads sensitivity allows high performance gains, whilst enforcing high privacy levels. Our results indicate that using sensitivity levels is feasible to optimize the performance of privacy preserving alignment, if one combines the advantages of private and public clouds.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292227v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292227v1?rss=1</link><published>1522393200000</published><title>Sensitivity Levels: Optimizing the Performance of Privacy Preserving DNA Alignment [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>331d12eb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The advent of high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) machines made DNA sequencing cheaper, but also put pressure on the genomic life-cycle, which includes aligning millions of short DNA sequences, called reads, to a reference genome. On the performance side, efficient algorithms have been developed, and parallelized on public clouds. On the privacy side, since genomic data are utterly sensitive, several cryptographic mechanisms have been proposed to align reads securely, with a lower performance than the former, which in turn are not secure. This manuscript proposes a novel contribution to improving the privacy X performance product in current genomic studies.

As an intrinsically global effect of protein dynamics, it is difficult to associate protein allostery with individual residues, hindering effective selection of key residues for mutagenesis studies. The machine learning models including decision tree (DT) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were applied to develop classification model for a cell signaling allosteric protein with two states showing extremely similar tertiary structures in both crystallographic structures and molecular dynamics simulations. Both DT and ANN models were developed with 75% and 80% of predicting accuracy, respectively. Good agreement between machine learning models and previous experimental as well as computational studies of the same protein validates this approach as an alternative way to analyze protein dynamics simulations and allostery.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to construct a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for measuring self-care performance (the CAT-SC) in children with developmental disabilities (DD) aged from 6 months to 12 years in a content-inclusive, precise, and efficient fashion.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was divided into 3 phases: (1) item bank development, (2) item testing, and (3) a simulation study to determine the stopping rules for the administration of the CAT-SC. A total of 215 caregivers of children with DD were interviewed with the 73-item CAT-SC item bank. An item response theory model was adopted for examining the construct validity to estimate item parameters after investigation of the unidimensionality, equality of slope parameters, item fitness, and differential item functioning (DIF). In the last phase, the reliability and concurrent validity of the CAT-SC were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The final CAT-SC item bank contained 56 items. The stopping rules suggested were (a) reliability coefficient greater than 0.9 or (b) 14 items administered. The results of simulation also showed that 85% of the estimated self-care performance scores would reach a reliability higher than 0.9 with a mean test length of 8.5 items, and the mean reliability for the rest was 0.86. Administering the CAT-SC could reduce the number of items administered by 75% to 84%. In addition, self-care performances estimated by the CAT-SC and the full item bank were very similar to each other (Pearson &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.98).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The newly developed CAT-SC can efficiently measure self-care performance in children with DD whose performances are comparable to those of TD children aged from 6 months to 12 years as precisely as the whole item bank. The item bank of the CAT-SC has good reliability and a unidimensional self-care construct, and the CAT can estimate self-care performance with less than 25% of the items in the item bank. Therefore, the CAT-SC could be useful for measuring self-care performance in children with DD in clinical and research settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193936</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193936</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Item-saving assessment of self-care performance in children with developmental disabilities: A prospective caregiver-report computerized adaptive test</title><fingerprint>cdb72b1d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng-Te Chen, Yu-Lan Chen, Yu-Ching Lin, Ching-Lin Hsieh, Jeng-Yi Tzeng, Kuan-Lin Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Qualitative studies indicated that cancer survivors may be worried about finding a partner in the future, but whether this concern is warranted is unknown. We examined single people´s interest in dating a cancer survivor, how they perceive survivors’ traits, and their preferences about the timing of disclosing a cancer history.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In three experimental vignette studies, dating website members (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 324) and college students (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 138 and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 131) were randomly assigned to a vignette of a person with or without a history of cancer (experiment 1 &amp;amp; 2), or a cancer survivor beyond or during active follow-up (experiment 3). Respondents rated their interest in dating this fictive person, this person’s traits, and indicated their preferences about the timing of disclosure. ANOVAs with main and interaction effects of condition, gender, and relationship history were conducted, partial eta squared and Cohen’s &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; were used to estimate the magnitude of effects. Correlations were used to investigate relationships between interest in a date and assessment of traits.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors’ traits were assessed more positively, but interest to date them did not differ from healthy vignettes for both men and women. However, widowed respondents were much less interested in a date with a cancer survivor, and women showed less interest in a cancer survivor during active follow-up relative to survivors beyond follow-up. Most respondents wanted to hear about the cancer diagnosis after a few dates, hardly anyone wanted to hear about this before the first date (2% - 5%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion and implications for cancer survivors &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors do not have to expect any more problems in finding a date than people without a cancer history, and can wait a few dates before disclosing.

In medicine, diagnoses based on medical test results are probabilistic by nature. Unfortunately, cognitive illusions regarding the statistical meaning of test results are well documented among patients, medical students, and even physicians. There are two effective strategies that can foster insight into what is known as Bayesian reasoning situations: (1) translating the statistical information on the prevalence of a disease and the sensitivity and the false-alarm rate of a specific test for that disease from probabilities into natural frequencies, and (2) illustrating the statistical information with tree diagrams, for instance, or with other pictorial representation. So far, such strategies have only been empirically tested in combination for “1-test cases”, where one binary hypothesis (“disease” vs. “no disease”) has to be diagnosed based on one binary test result (“positive” vs. “negative”). However, in reality, often more than one medical test is conducted to derive a diagnosis. In two studies, we examined a total of 388 medical students from the University of Regensburg (Germany) with medical “2-test scenarios”. Each student had to work on two problems: diagnosing breast cancer with mammography and sonography test results, and diagnosing HIV infection with the ELISA and Western Blot tests. In Study 1 (N = 190 participants), we systematically varied the presentation of statistical information (“only textual information” vs. “only tree diagram” vs. “text and tree diagram in combination”), whereas in Study 2 (N = 198 participants), we varied the kinds of tree diagrams (“complete tree” vs. “highlighted tree” vs. “pruned tree”). All versions were implemented in probability format (including probability trees) and in natural frequency format (including frequency trees). We found that natural frequency trees, especially when the question-related branches were highlighted, improved performance, but that none of the corresponding probabilistic visualizations did.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195029</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195029</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Visualizing the Bayesian 2-test case: The effect of tree diagrams on medical decision making</title><fingerprint>272c294d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karin Binder, Stefan Krauss, Georg Bruckmaier, Jörg Marienhagen&lt;/p&gt;

We found that natural frequency trees, especially when the question-related branches were highlighted, improved performance, but that none of the corresponding probabilistic visualizations did.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195029</canonicalUrl><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f21:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3286.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Lengshi Dai, Virginia Best, Barbara G.

Background &lt;p&gt;While links between disability and poverty are well established, there have been few longitudinal studies to clarify direction of causality, particularly among older adults in low and middle income countries. We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as ‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64–2.22) in care households.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people’s needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195567</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195567</link><published>1523653200000</published><title>A cohort study of the effects of older adult care dependence upon household economic functioning, in Peru, Mexico and China</title><fingerprint>9d62ddb3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maëlenn M.

In the present study, we examined the effects of different drying conditions on the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages. We approached this objective by comparing invertebrate assemblages in perennial and intermittent sites along two intermittent Mediterranean streams with contrasting predictability, duration, and spatial patterns of drying: Fuirosos (high predictability, short duration, downstream drying pattern) and Rogativa (low predictability, long duration, patchy drying pattern). Specifically, we quantified the contribution of individual taxa to those differences, the degree of nestedness, and shifts in the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages along flow intermittence gradients. We observed greater effects of drying on the benthic invertebrate composition in Fuirosos than in Rogativa, resulting in a higher dissimilarity of assemblages between perennial and intermittent sites, as well as a lower degree of nestedness. Furthermore, a higher number of biotic metrics related to richness, abundance and biological traits were significantly different between perennial and intermittent sites in Fuirosos, despite a shorter dry period compared to Rogativa. At the same time, slightly different responses were detected during post-drying (autumn) than pre-drying (spring) conditions in this stream. In Rogativa, shifts in benthic invertebrate assemblages along increasing gradients of flow intermittence were found for three metrics (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and Odonata, Coleoptera and Heteroptera (OCH) abundances and aerial active dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined gradients of dry period duration and distance to nearest perennial reach can generate complex, and different, responses of benthic invertebrate assemblages, depending on the flow intermittence metric. Our study advances the notion that special attention should be paid to the predictability, duration and spatial patterns of drying in intermittent streams in order to disentangle the effects of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages, in particular in areas subject to high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in drying conditions.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193933</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193933</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Understanding the effects of predictability, duration, and spatial pattern of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages in two contrasting intermittent streams</title><fingerprint>2ad5a22a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by María Mar Sánchez-Montoya, Daniel von Schiller, Gonzalo G.

Our study advances the notion that special attention should be paid to the predictability, duration and spatial patterns of drying in intermittent streams in order to disentangle the effects of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages, in particular in areas subject to high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in drying conditions.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193933</canonicalUrl><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2807:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04087-3</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How a chicken makes a good egg&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How a chicken makes a good egg, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04087-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04087-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nanostructures and a binding protein create a shell strong enough to protect a chick but soft enough for it to hatch.</description><engagement>26</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04087-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04087-3</link><published>1522738800000</published><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>accef635</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How a chicken makes a good egg&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How a chicken makes a good egg, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04087-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04087-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nanostructures and a binding protein create a shell strong enough to protect a chick but soft enough for it to hatch.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1628d091f62:95ea4db:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04087-3/d41586-018-04087-3_15574038.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1522784608098</crawled><title>How a chicken makes a good egg</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006083</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><author><name>The PLOS Computational Biology Staff</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS Computational Biology Staff &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TL7IjpfSpYk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006083</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/TL7IjpfSpYk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006083</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Correction: MAGPIE: Simplifying access and execution of computational models in the life sciences</title><fingerprint>f094e52d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS Computational Biology Staff &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TL7IjpfSpYk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522098000000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b9:a077e55f</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><unread>True</unread><recrawled>1522095842894</recrawled></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3114.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Naina Kurup, Yunbo Li, Alexandr Goncharov, Yishi Jin</name></author><description>Neural circuits utilize a coordinated cellular machinery to form and eliminate synaptic connections, with the neuronal cytoskeleton playing a prominent role.

The sodium-independent cystine-glutamate antiporter plays an important role in extracellular cystine uptake. It comprises the transmembrane protein, xCT and its chaperone, CD98. Because glutathione is only weakly cell membrane permeable, cellular uptake of its precursor, cystine, is known to be a key step in glutathione synthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that xCT expression affects the progression of tumors and their resistance to therapy. Sulfasalazine is an inhibitor of xCT that is known to increase cellular oxidative stress, giving it anti-tumor potential. Here, we describe a radio-sensitizing effect of sulfasalazine using a B16F10 melanoma model. Sulfasalazine decreased glutathione concentrations and resistance to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in B16F10 melanoma cells, but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. It synergistically enhanced the cyto-killing effect of X-irradiation in B16F10 cells. It inhibited cellular DNA damage repair and prolonged cell cycle arrest after X-irradiation. Furthermore, in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; transplanted melanoma model, sulfasalazine decreased intratumoral glutathione content, leading to enhanced susceptibility to radiation therapy. These results suggest the possibility of using SAS to augment the treatment of radio-resistant cancers.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195151</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195151</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Sulfasalazine, an inhibitor of the cystine-glutamate antiporter, reduces DNA damage repair and enhances radiosensitivity in murine B16F10 melanoma</title><fingerprint>1aa12fc1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Masaki Nagane, Eiichi Kanai, Yuki Shibata, Takuto Shimizu, Chie Yoshioka, Takuya Maruo, Tadashi Yamashita&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of the study was to develop Tizanidine HCl (TZN) and Meloxicam (MLX) loaded bilayer mucoadhesive films intended for buccal administration, aiming to enhance the bioavailability. Bilayer films were prepared by solvent evaporation technique selecting arabinoxylan (ARX) as a sustained release (SR) layer forming polymer and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) E-15 as an immediate release (IR) layer-forming polymer. Prepared films were subjected to &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug release, surface morphology, mechanical strength, compatibility of the ingredients, drug contents, &lt;i&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/i&gt; mucoadhesion strength and drug permeation. Crossover study design was applied to study the i&lt;i&gt;n-vivo&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetics by using albino rabbits. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; of both drugs loaded in films were compared with standard solution/dispersion administered to the rabbits at the dose of 1mg/kg. The results unveiled instant release and permeation of MLX from IR layer, while good controlled release and permeation characteristics of TZN from SR films over 8 h. films were of uniform thickness with smooth surface and satisfactory mechanical strength. Mucoadhesion strength was sufficient to provide suitable contact time with mucosal membrane. The pharmacokinetic study exhibited prompt absorption of MLX with better AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (6655.64 ng/ml*h vs 6538.99 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (436.98 ng/ml vs 411.33 ng/ml) from oral dispersion. Similarly buccal films has shown enhanced half-life (9.91hr vs 2.51 hr), AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (1043.4 ng/ml*h vs 149.1 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (91.92 ng/ml vs 42.29 ng/ml) from oral solution. A statistical investigation disclosed a significantly improved pharmacokinetics of TZN and MLX after their absorption across buccal route following administration of buccal film &lt;i&gt;(p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05)&lt;/i&gt;.

The goal of this study was to evaluate survival of important viral pathogens of livestock in animal feed ingredients imported daily into the United States under simulated transboundary conditions. Eleven viruses were selected based on global significance and impact to the livestock industry, including Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV), Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), Influenza A Virus of Swine (IAV-S), Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Nipah Virus (NiV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Swine Vesicular Disease Virus (SVDV), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) and Vesicular Exanthema of Swine Virus (VESV). Surrogate viruses with similar genetic and physical properties were used for 6 viruses. Surrogates belonged to the same virus families as target pathogens, and included Senecavirus A (SVA) for FMDV, Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) for CSFV, Bovine Herpesvirus Type 1 (BHV-1) for PRV, Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) for NiV, Porcine Sapelovirus (PSV) for SVDV and Feline Calicivirus (FCV) for VESV. For the remaining target viruses, actual pathogens were used. Virus survival was evaluated using Trans-Pacific or Trans-Atlantic transboundary models involving representative feed ingredients, transport times and environmental conditions, with samples tested by PCR, VI and/or swine bioassay.

The goal of this study was to evaluate survival of important viral pathogens of livestock in animal feed ingredients imported daily into the United States under simulated transboundary conditions. Eleven viruses were selected based on global significance and impact to the livestock industry, including Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV), Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), Influenza A Virus of Swine (IAV-S), Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Nipah Virus (NiV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Swine Vesicular Disease Virus (SVDV), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) and Vesicular Exanthema of Swine Virus (VESV). Surrogate viruses with similar genetic and physical properties were used for 6 viruses. Surrogates belonged to the same virus families as target pathogens, and included Senecavirus A (SVA) for FMDV, Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) for CSFV, Bovine Herpesvirus Type 1 (BHV-1) for PRV, Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) for NiV, Porcine Sapelovirus (PSV) for SVDV and Feline Calicivirus (FCV) for VESV. For the remaining target viruses, actual pathogens were used. Virus survival was evaluated using Trans-Pacific or Trans-Atlantic transboundary models involving representative feed ingredients, transport times and environmental conditions, with samples tested by PCR, VI and/or swine bioassay. SVA (representing FMDV), FCV (representing VESV), BHV-1 (representing PRV), PRRSV, PSV (representing SVDV), ASFV and PCV2 maintained infectivity during transport, while BVDV (representing CSFV), VSV, CDV (representing NiV) and IAV-S did not. Notably, more viruses survived in conventional soybean meal, lysine hydrochloride, choline chloride, vitamin D and pork sausage casings. These results support published data on transboundary risk of PEDV in feed, demonstrate survival of certain viruses in specific feed ingredients (“high-risk combinations”) under conditions simulating transport between continents and provide further evidence that contaminated feed ingredients may represent a risk for transport of pathogens at domestic and global levels.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194509</canonicalUrl><updated>1521579600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37ae:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0127-z</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Neuroscience</title></origin><author><name>Jinyue Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tbr1 instructs laminar patterning of retinal ganglion cell dendrites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tbr1 instructs laminar patterning of retinal ganglion cell dendrites, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0127-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0127-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Specific retinal connectivity depends on laminar restriction of neuronal processes.

Often &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; are harmless and/or beneficial bacteria inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of livestock and humans. However, Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) have been linked to human disease. Cattle are the primary reservoir for STEC and STEC “super-shedders” are considered to be a major contributor in animal to animal transmission. Among STEC, O157:H7 is the most recognized serotype, but in recent years, non-O157 STEC have been increasingly linked to human disease. In Argentina and Germany, O178 is considered an emerging pathogen. Our objective was to compare populations of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178, O157, shiga toxin 1 and 2 in western Canadian cattle feces from a sampling pool of ~80,000 beef cattle collected at two slaughterhouses. Conventional PCR was utilized to screen 1,773 samples for presence/absence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178. A subset of samples (n = 168) was enumerated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and proportions of O178, O157 and shiga toxins 1 &amp;amp; 2 specific-fragments were calculated as a proportion of generic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (GEC) specific-fragments. Distribution of &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by comparing &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O157 enumerations. Conventional PCR detected the presence of O178 in 873 of 1,773 samples and ddPCR found the average proportion of O178, O157, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the samples 2.8%, 0.6%, 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively. Quantification of &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; revealed more virulence genes than could be exclusively attributed to O157. Our results confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178 in western Canadian cattle and ddPCR revealed O178 as a greater proportion of GEC than was O157.

Endothelial dysfunction is one of the main pathological changes in Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway is associated with endothelial dysfunction. However, the interaction between ROCK and nuclear factor of activated T cells isoform c3 (NFATc3) in the development of this pathological response under chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is unclear. To simulate the OSA model, we established a moderate CIH rat model by administering the fraction of inspired O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from 21% to 9%, 20 times/h, 8 h/day for 3 weeks. Fasudil (ROCK inhibitor, 8 mg/kg/d, i.p.) was administrated in the rats exposed to CIH for 3 weeks. Our results demonstrated that CIH caused significantly endothelial dysfunction, accompanying with increased ET-1 level, decreased eNOS expression and NO production, which reduced ACh-induced vascular relaxation responses. Moreover, RhoA/ROCK-2/NFATc3 expressions were up-regulated. Fasudil significantly improved CIH induced endothelial dysfunction. Data suggested that the ROCK activation is necessary for endothelial dysfunction during CIH.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195604</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195604</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Fasudil improves endothelial dysfunction in rats exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia through RhoA/ROCK/NFATc3 pathway</title><fingerprint>37a8a2b4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jie-Ru Li, Ya-Shuo Zhao, Yue Chang, Sheng-Chang Yang, Ya-Jing Guo, En-Sheng Ji&lt;/p&gt;

Biofilms are microbial collectives that occupy a diverse array of surfaces. It is well known that the function and evolution of biofilms are strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of different strains and species within them, but how spatiotemporal distributions of different genotypes in biofilm populations originate is still underexplored. Here, we study the origins of biofilm genetic structure by combining model development, numerical simulations, and microfluidic experiments using the human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt;. Using spatial correlation functions to quantify the differences between emergent cell lineage segregation patterns, we find that strong adhesion often, but not always, maximizes the size of clonal cell clusters on flat surfaces. Counterintuitively, our model predicts that, under some conditions, investing in adhesion can reduce rather than increase clonal group size. Our results emphasize that a complex interaction between fluid flow and cell adhesiveness can underlie emergent patterns of biofilm genetic structure. This structure, in turn, has an outsize influence on how biofilm-dwelling populations function and evolve.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LcIezdmCHM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d1:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ricardo Martínez-García, Carey D.

Several studies suggest that low birthweight resulting from restricted intrauterine growth can leave a metabolic footprint which may persist into adulthood. To investigate this, we performed metabolomic profiling on 5036 female twins, aged 18–80, with weight at birth information available from the TwinsUK cohort and performed independent replication in two additional cohorts. Out of 422 compounds tested, 25 metabolites associated with birthweight in these twins, replicated in 1951 men and women from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS, aged 66) and in 2391 men and women from the North Finland Birth 1986 cohort (NFBC, aged 16). We found distinct heterogeneity between sexes and, after adjusting for multiple tests and heterogeneity, two metabolites were reproducible overall (propionylcarnitine and 3-4-hydroxyphenyllactate). Testing women only, we found other metabolites associated with lower birthweight from the meta-analysis of the three cohorts (2-hydroxy-butyric acid and γ-glutamylleucine). Higher levels of all these metabolites can be linked to insulin resistance, oxidative stress or a dysfunction of energy metabolism, suggesting that low birthweight in both twins and singletons are having an impact on these pathways in adulthood.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194316</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194316</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Metabolomic signatures of low birthweight: Pathways to insulin resistance and oxidative stress</title><fingerprint>eb11472a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah Jane Metrustry, Ville Karhunen, Mark H.

&lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of &lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

Sinkholes are a well-known geologic hazard but their past occurrence, useful for subsidence risk prediction, is difficult to define, especially for ancient historic times. Consequently, our knowledge about Holocene carbonate landscapes is often limited. A multidisciplinary study of Trieste Karst (Italy), close to early Roman military fortifications, led to the identification of possible ancient road tracks, cut by at least one sinkhole. Electrical Resistivity Tomography through the sinkhole has suggested the presence of a cave below its bottom, possibly responsible of the sinkhole formation, while Ground Penetrating Radar has detected no tectonic disturbances underneath the tracks. Additionally, archaeological surveys led to the discovery of over 200 Roman shoe hobnails within or close to the investigated route. According to these data, the tracks are interpreted as the remains of a main Roman road, whose itinerary has been reconstructed for more than 4 km together with other elements of ancient landscape. Our results provide the first known evidence of a Roman main road swallowed by sinkholes and suggest that Holocene karst landscapes could be much different from what previously believed. In fact, sinkholes visible nowadays in the investigated region could have been flat areas filled by sediments up to the Roman time.</description><engagement>41</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194939</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194939</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Discovery of ancient Roman &quot;highway&quot; reveals geomorphic changes in karst environments during historic times</title><fingerprint>9df99bf0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Bernardini, Giacomo Vinci, Emanuele Forte, Stefano Furlani, Michele Pipan, Sara Biolchi, Angelo De Min, Andrea Fragiacomo, Roberto Micheli, Paola Ventura, Claudio Tuniz&lt;/p&gt;

Many fossil specimens exhibit deformations caused by taphonomic processes. Due to these deformations, even important specimens have to be excluded from morphometric analyses, impoverishing an already poor paleontological record. Techniques to retrodeform and virtually restore damaged (i.e. deformed) specimens are available, but these methods genenerally imply the use of a sparse set of bilateral landmarks, ignoring the fact that the distribution and amount of control points directly affects the result of the retrodeformation. We propose a method developed in the R environment and available in the R-package “Morpho” that, in addition to the landmark configurations, also allows using a set of semi-landmarks homogeneously distributed along curves and on surfaces. We evaluated the outcome of the retrodeformation, regarding the number of semi-landmarks used and its robustness against asymmetric noise, based on simulations using a virtually deformed gorilla cranium. Finally, we applied the method to a well-known Neanderthal cranium that exhibits signs of taphonomically induced asymmetry.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Retrodeformation of fossil specimens based on 3D bilateral semi-landmarks: Implementation in the R package “Morpho”</title><fingerprint>eedb143f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Schlager, Antonio Profico, Fabio Di Vincenzo, Giorgio Manzi&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, we applied the method to a well-known Neanderthal cranium that exhibits signs of taphonomically induced asymmetry.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</canonicalUrl><updated>1521493200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88eb:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00082</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Oliver W.

RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/05/293670</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16296e5e0b0:a681943:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522950070448</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24170-z</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Jenny-Ann Phan</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24170-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/ZOgUmxq9lP0/s41598-018-24170-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24170-z</link><published>1523862000000</published><title>Author Correction: Radioligand binding analysis of α 2 adrenoceptors with [11C]yohimbine in brain in vivo: Extended Inhibition Plot correction for plasma protein binding</title><fingerprint>9fa2079d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Radioligand binding analysis of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adrenoceptors with [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]yohimbine in brain in vivo: Extended Inhibition Plot correction for plasma protein binding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Radioligand binding analysis of &amp;lt;i&gt;α&amp;lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; adrenoceptors with [&amp;lt;sup&gt;11&amp;lt;/sup&gt;C]yohimbine in brain in vivo: Extended Inhibition Plot correction for plasma protein binding, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24170-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24170-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Radioligand binding analysis of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adrenoceptors with [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]yohimbine in brain in vivo: Extended Inhibition Plot correction for plasma protein binding&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ZOgUmxq9lP0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162cd4ec639:27fb976:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Radioligand binding analysis of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adrenoceptors with [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]yohimbine in brain in vivo: Extended Inhibition Plot correction for plasma protein binding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Radioligand binding analysis of &amp;lt;i&gt;α&amp;lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; adrenoceptors with [&amp;lt;sup&gt;11&amp;lt;/sup&gt;C]yohimbine in brain in vivo: Extended Inhibition Plot correction for plasma protein binding, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24170-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24170-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Radioligand binding analysis of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adrenoceptors with [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]yohimbine in brain in vivo: Extended Inhibition Plot correction for plasma protein binding&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ZOgUmxq9lP0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523862914617</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2970.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Weihua Wu, Fang Liu, Seema Singh</name></author><description>Efficient lignin valorization could add more than 10-fold the value gained from burning it for energy and is critical for economic viability of future biorefineries.

Background &lt;p&gt;Concerns regarding vaccine safety are increasing along with lack of compliance to vaccination schedules. This study aimed to assess vaccination-related risks and the impact of a Special Immunization Service (SIS) at the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of Padua on vaccination compliance among participants.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study included all children attending the SIS from January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2002 to December 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2015. The Service is divided into a clinic (SIS-C) where all referred children undergo a pre-vaccination visit and an area within the Pediatric Emergency Department (SIS-PED) where children are vaccinated if indicated. During each SIS-C visit, age, gender, admission criteria and scheduled vaccinations were recorded, with any vaccine-related adverse events captured during SIS-PED visits. Follow-up was conducted to evaluate vaccination plan completion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;359 children received 560 vaccine administrations (41.3% MMR/MMRV, 17.5% hexavalent) at the SIS during the 14 year study. Admission criteria were adverse events after previous vaccination (immediate, IgE/not IgE mediated, and late) in 27.2% of cases, non-anaphylactic allergies (mostly egg allergy) in 42.7% and anaphylaxis in 10.3%.

Background &lt;p&gt;African Americans are disproportionately affected by both HIV and hypertension. Failure to modify risk factors for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease such as hypertension among HIV-infected patients may attenuate the benefits conferred by combination antiretroviral therapy. In the general population, African Americans with hypertension are less likely to have controlled blood pressure than whites. However, racial differences in blood pressure control among HIV-infected patients are not well studied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study evaluating racial differences in hypertension prevalence, treatment, and control among 1,664 patients attending the University of Alabama at Birmingham HIV Clinic in 2013. Multivariable analyses were performed to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measure of association between race and hypertension prevalence and control while adjusting for other covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean age of patients was 47 years, 77% were male and 54% African-American. The prevalence of hypertension was higher among African Americans compared with whites (49% vs. 43%; p = 0.02). Among those with hypertension, 91% of African Americans and 93% of whites were treated (p = 0.43). Among those treated, 50% of African Americans versus 60% of whites had controlled blood pressure (systolic blood pressure &amp;lt;140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &amp;lt;90 mmHg) (p = 0.007). After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, prevalence of hypertension was higher among African Americans compared to whites (PR 1.25; 95% CI 1.12–1.39) and prevalence of BP control was lower (PR 0.80; 95% CI 0.69–0.93).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Despite comparable levels of hypertension treatment, African Americans in our HIV cohort were less likely to achieve blood pressure control. This may place them at increased risk for adverse outcomes that disproportionately impact HIV-infected patients, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, and thus attenuate the benefits conferred by combination antiretroviral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194940</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194940</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Racial disparities in the prevalence and control of hypertension among a cohort of HIV-infected patients in the southeastern United States</title><fingerprint>27d56c6d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Greer A.

In eukaryotes, oscillatory dynamics are thought to arise from interactions at the protein and RNA levels; however, the role of non-coding RNA in regulating these dynamics remains understudied. In this work, using a mathematical model, we show how non-coding RNA acting as miRNA sponges in a conserved miRNA - transcription factor feedback motif, can give rise to oscillatory behaviour. Control of these non-coding RNA can dynamically create oscillations or stability, and we show how this behaviour predisposes to oscillations in the stochastic limit.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). Natural killer cell responses play a crucial role in autoimmune disease through innate immunity, in which killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are closely involved. Although the genetic combination of KIRs with their specific HLA class I ligands has been associated with IBD in Caucasians, such KIR-HLA receptor-ligand combinations are not fully understood in the Japanese. We investigated 14 KIR genes along with HLA-Bw and -C ligands in 90 patients with UC and 50 patients with CD and compared them with the characteristics of 325 healthy control subjects. The frequency of HLA-Bw4 was significantly increased in patients with UC (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;; odds ratio [OR] = 3.39) and CD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0065; OR = 2.32) versus controls. The UC group had a significantly higher frequency of KIR2DS3 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024; OR = 1.94) and lower frequency of KIR2DS4 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019; OR = 0.40) and KIR2DL1-HLA-C2 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.035; OR = 0.47). The Tel-A/B haplotype was significantly decreased in UC patients (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0056; OR = 0.49). The frequency of KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 was significantly higher in patients with UC (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;; OR = 3.12) and CD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0067; OR = 2.30).

Increasingly, ecoimmunology studies aim to use relevant pathogen exposure to examine the impacts of infection on physiological processes in wild animals. Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (“arboviruses”) responsible for millions of cases of human illnesses each year. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is a unique alphavirus that is transmitted by a cimicid insect, the swallow bug, and is amplified in two avian species: the house sparrow (&lt;i&gt;Passer domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) and the cliff swallow (&lt;i&gt;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota)&lt;/i&gt;. BCRV, like many alphaviruses, exhibits age-dependent susceptibility where the young are most susceptible to developing disease and exhibit a high mortality rate. However, alphavirus disease etiology in nestling birds is unknown. In this study, we infected nestling house sparrows with Buggy Creek virus and measured virological, pathological, growth, and digestive parameters following infection. Buggy Creek virus caused severe encephalitis in all infected nestlings, and the peak viral concentration in brain tissue was over 34 times greater than any other tissue. Growth, tissue development, and digestive function were all significantly impaired during BCRV infection. However, based on histopathological analysis performed, this impairment does not appear to be the result of direct tissue damage by the virus, but likely caused by encephalitis and neuronal invasion and impairment of the central nervous system. This is the first study to examine the course of alphavirus diseases in nestling birds and these results will improve our understanding of age-dependent infections of alphaviruses in vertebrate hosts.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195467</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195467</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>High costs of infection: Alphavirus infection reduces digestive function and bone and feather growth in nestling house sparrows (&amp;lt;i&gt;Passer domesticus&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><fingerprint>bdc671fd</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carol A.

Background &lt;p&gt;PPAR-gamma (γ) is highly expressed in macrophages and its activation affects their polarization. The effect of PPAR-γ activation on Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) has not yet been evaluated. We investigated the effect of PPAR-γ activation on KC-polarization and IRI.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy percent (70%) liver ischemia was induced for 60mins. PPAR-γ-agonist or vehicle was administrated before reperfusion. PPAR-γ-antagonist was used to block PPAR-γ activation. Liver injury, necrosis, and apoptosis were assessed post-reperfusion. Flow-cytometry determined KC-phenotypes (pro-inflammatory Nitric Oxide +, anti-inflammatory CD206+ and anti-inflammatory IL-10+).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liver injury assessed by serum AST was significantly decreased in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group at all time points post reperfusion (1hr: 3092±105 vs 4469±551; p = 0.042; 6hr: 7041±1160 vs 12193±1143; p = 0.015; 12hr: 5746±328 vs 8608±1259; p = 0.049). Furthermore, liver apoptosis measured by TUNEL-staining was significantly reduced in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group post reperfusion (1hr:2.46±0.49 vs 6.90±0.85%;p = 0.001; 6hr:26.40±2.93 vs 50.13±8.29%; p = 0.048). H&amp;amp;E staining demonstrated less necrosis in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (24hr:26.66±4.78 vs 45.62±4.57%; p = 0.032). The percentage of pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs was significantly lower at all post reperfusion time points in the PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (1hr:28.49±4.99 vs 53.54±9.15%; p = 0.040; 6hr:5.51±0.54 vs 31.12±9.58%; p = 0.009; 24hr:4.15±1.50 vs 17.10±4.77%; p = 0.043). In contrast, percentage of anti-inflammatory CD206+ KCs was significantly higher in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group prior to IRI (8.62±0.96 vs 4.88 ±0.50%; p = 0.04). Administration of PPAR-γ-antagonist reversed the beneficial effects on AST, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;PPAR-γ activation reduces IRI and decreases the pro-inflammatory NO+ Kupffer cells.

The occurrence of water stress during wheat growth is more frequent due to climate change. Three experiments (cyclic drought, cyclic waterlogging, and cyclic drought plus waterlogging) were conducted to investigate the effects of mild and severe cyclic/single water stress at elongation and heading stages on winter wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.) yield. The effect of either mild drought at elongation or mild waterlogging at heading on wheat yield was not significant; however, significance did occur under other single water stresses. As the stress becomes more severe, the yield loss significantly increases. Extreme drought/waterlogging treatment at elongation caused a greater yield penalty than stress at heading stage. Except the combination of mild drought and mild waterlogging treatment, cyclic water stress significantly decreased wheat yields. The decrease in wheat yield under cyclic severe drought and waterlogging was significantly higher than any other treatment, with percentage decreases of 71.52 and 73.51%, respectively. In general, a yield reduction from mild cyclic water stress did not indicate more severe damage than single treatments; in contrast, grain yield suffered more when water stress occurred again after severe drought and waterlogging. Drought during elongation significantly decreased kernel number, whereas drought at heading/waterlogging during elongation and heading decreased the spike weight, which might be the main reason for the yield penalty. Furthermore, water stress caused variation in the decrease of total biomass and/or harvest index. The present study indicates comprehensive understanding of the types, degree, and stages of water stress are essential for assessing the impact of multiple water stresses on wheat yield.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195535</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195535</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Does cyclic water stress damage wheat yield more than a single stress?</title><fingerprint>84746a3f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinfeng Ding, Zhengjin Huang, Min Zhu, Chunyan Li, Xinkai Zhu, Wenshan Guo&lt;/p&gt;

The necrophilous insect fauna on carcasses varies seasonally and geographically.

The necrophilous insect fauna on carcasses varies seasonally and geographically.

Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is the complex homeostatic regulatory relationship between blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). This study aimed to analyze the frequency-specific coupling function between cerebral oxyhemoglobin concentrations (delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) signals based on a model of coupled phase oscillators and dynamical Bayesian inference. Delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] was measured by 24-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and arterial BP signals were obtained by simultaneous resting-state measurements in patients with stroke, that is, 9 with left hemiparesis (L–H group), 8 with right hemiparesis (R–H group), and 17 age-matched healthy individuals as control (healthy group). The coupling functions from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] oscillators were identified and analyzed in four frequency intervals (I, 0.6–2 Hz; II, 0.145–0.6 Hz; III, 0.052–0.145 Hz; and IV, 0.021–0.052 Hz). In L–H group, the CS from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in interval III in channel 8 was significantly higher than that in healthy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). Compared with the healthy controls, the coupling in MAP→delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] showed higher amplitude in interval I and IV in patients with stroke. The increased CS and coupling amplitude may be an evidence of impairment in CA, thereby confirming the presence of impaired CA in patients with stroke. In interval III, the CS in L–H group from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in channel 16 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) was significantly lower than that in healthy controls, which might indicate the compensatory mechanism in CA of the unaffected side in patients with stroke. No significant difference in region-wise CS between affected and unaffected sides was observed in stroke groups, indicating an evidence of globally impaired CA. These findings provide a method for the assessment of CA and will contribute to the development of therapeutic interventions in stroke patients.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195936</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195936</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Alterations in the coupling functions between cerebral oxyhaemoglobin and arterial blood pressure signals in post-stroke subjects</title><fingerprint>479055e5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Honglun Su, Congcong Huo, Bitian Wang, Wenhao Li, Gongcheng Xu, Qianying Liu, Zengyong Li&lt;/p&gt;

The substitution of fish resources as ingredients for aquafeeds by those based on vegetable sources is needed to ensure aquaculture sustainability in the future. It is known that Senegalese sole (&lt;i&gt;Solea senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;) accepts high dietary content of plant ingredients without altering growth or flesh quality parameters. However, scarce information is available regarding the long-term impact of vegetable diets (combining the inclusion of both vegetable protein and oils) on the stress response and immunity of this fish species. This study aims to evaluate the concomitant effect of the extended use of vegetable protein-based diets with fish oil (FO) replacement (0, 50 or 100%) by vegetable oils (VO), on the response to acute (10 min) or prolonged (4 days) stress, induced by thermal shock. Plasma levels of cortisol, glucose and lactate as well as hepatic levels of glucose, glycogen and lactate were evaluated as primary and secondary responses to stress, 6 and 18 months after feeding the experimental diets (6 and 18 MAF). The brain monoaminergic activity in telencephalon and hypothalamus, and non-specific immune parameters were also evaluated. As expected, thermal shock induced an increase in values of plasma parameters related to stress, which was more evident in acute than in prolonged stress. Stress also affected lactate levels in the liver and the values of the alternative complement pathway-ACH50 in the plasma. Dietary substitution of FO induced an effect &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on some parameters such as decreased hepatic glucose and glycogen levels and peroxidase activity in plasma as well enhanced serotonergic activity in brain of non-stressed fish. The results obtained in some parameters indicate that there is an interaction between the use of vegetable diets with the physiological response to thermal stress, as is the case of the hepatic lactate, serotonergic neurotransmission in brain, and the activity of ACH50 in plasma. These results suggest that the inclusion of VO in plant protein based diets point to a slightly inhibited stress response, more evident for an acute than a prolonged stress.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194353</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194353</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Influence of vegetable diets on physiological and immune responses to thermal stress in Senegalese sole (&amp;lt;i&gt;Solea senegalensis&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><fingerprint>2d6b30d0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Conde-Sieira, Manuel Gesto, Sónia Batista, Fátima Linares, José L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Different outcomes among patients hospitalized for bleeding after starting anticoagulation could influence choice of anticoagulant. We compared length of hospitalization, proportion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and 30- and 90-day mortality for adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An US commercial database of 38 million members from 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2014 was used to examine adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin (2,446), dabigatran (442), or rivaroxaban (256). Outcomes included difference in mean total length of hospitalization, proportion of ICU admissions, mean length of ICU stay, and all-cause 30- and 90-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Warfarin users were older and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression modeling with propensity score weighting showed warfarin users were hospitalized 2.0 days longer (95% CI 1.8–2.3; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than dabigatran users and 2.6 days longer (95% CI 2.4–2.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. Dabigatran users were hospitalized 0.6 days longer (95% CI 0.2–1.0; p = 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in the proportion of ICU admissions. Among ICU admissions, warfarin users stayed 3.0 days (95% CI 1.9–3.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) longer than dabigatran users and 2.4 days longer (95% CI 0.9–3.7; p = 0.003) than rivaroxaban users.

There were no differences in 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with shorter hospitalizations; however, there were no differences in 30- and 90-day mortality.

Background &lt;p&gt;Different outcomes among patients hospitalized for bleeding after starting anticoagulation could influence choice of anticoagulant. We compared length of hospitalization, proportion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and 30- and 90-day mortality for adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An US commercial database of 38 million members from 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2014 was used to examine adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin (2,446), dabigatran (442), or rivaroxaban (256).

The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular and respiratory effects of two volumes of bupivacaine 0.25% (0.2 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—treatment BUP02—and 0.4 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; –treatment BUP04) administered epidurally at the lumbosacral intervertebral space in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane. This experimental prospective randomized crossover design trial used six mixed breed adult dogs, four neutered males and two spayed females. Each dog was anesthetized on three different occasions: the first for isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) measurement, and the following two assigned treatments (BUP02 or BUP04). On the two treatment days, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane at 1.3 MAC during the experiments. Cardiovascular and respiratory measurements were recorded before (T0) and 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the epidural administration of bupivacaine. Comparisons between and within groups were performed by a mixed-model ANOVA and Friedman’s test when appropriate followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test or Dunnet’s test to compare time points within each treatment with T0 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly from 15 to 90 minutes after the administration of BUP02 and from 5 to 60 minutes in BUP04, with lower values in BUP04 than in BUP02 lasting up to 30 minutes after bupivacaine administration. No significant changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were observed in either treatment. Hypoventilation was only detected in BUP04. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial oxygen content decreased after both treatment of bupivacaine with no significant decrease in oxygen delivery. Two dogs in BUP04 developed Horner’s syndrome. The epidural administration of 0.4 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of bupivacaine to dogs in sternal recumbency anesthetized with isoflurane 1.3 MAC caused more cardiovascular and respiratory depression than 0.2 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195867</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195867</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Cardiovascular and respiratory effects of lumbosacral epidural bupivacaine in isoflurane-anesthetized dogs: The effects of two volumes of 0.25% solution</title><fingerprint>84badf49</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Raquel Sartori Gonçalves Dias, João Henrique Neves Soares, Douglas dos Santos e Castro, Maria Alice Kuster de Albuquerque Gress, Marcela Lemos Machado, Pablo E.

Background &lt;p&gt;In Kazakhstan, scarce official prevalence data exists for mood disorders. This study investigates the occurrence of depressive symptoms among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and the relationship between depressive symptoms, HIV treatment initiation and antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients seen at the Almaty AIDS Center between April and December 2013. Two data sources were used: 1) self-administered survey that included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to capture depression symptoms and 2) medical record review. Two primary outcomes were evaluated with log-binomial models and Fisher’s exact test: the relationship between depression symptoms and 1) HIV treatment group, and 2) HIV adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 564 participants, 9.9% reported symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder. None had received treatment for depression. Among those not on ART, a relationship between depressive symptoms and low CD4 counts (≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident (7.1% for CD4 ≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 0.9% for CD4 &gt; 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, p = 0.029). In multivariable analysis, a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms was statistically associated with ART treatment, positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) status, and being unmarried. For those taking ART, treatment adherence was not statistically associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms (12.5% vs 20.0%, p = 0.176); limited power may have impacted statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Untreated depression was found among PLWHA suggesting the need to evaluate access to psychiatric treatment.

Background &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have established a correlation between coronary artery calcification (CAC) measured by ECG-gated chest computed tomography (CT) and cardiovascular disease. Recent reports which included asymptomatic patients suggest that CAC measured on non-ECG gated CT is similarly associated with cardiovascular risk. This study investigates the correlation between the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and an incidental finding of CAC on a non-gated chest CT performed for non-cardiac indications in young and seemingly healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study that included 162 CT scans performed in young patients aged 18–50 years old for non-cardiac indications in our institution was conducted. CAC score (CACS) was calculated using the Agatston method. FRS was calculated and compared to the CACS using three different approaches. The correlations between the CACS and several specific factors (i.e. age, body mass index, smoking, statins, etc.), were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of patients was 36.43 year old and 105 (64.8%) were male. We found a significant positive correlation between the CACS and the FRS in all three approaches (p&amp;lt;0.05). Increased age, smoking and statin use were the only individual factors clearly associated with an increase in CACS (p = 0.002, p = 0.045 and p = 0.009, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This is the first report indicating that incidental CACS identified in non-gated MDCT is also associated with cardiovascular risk evaluated by FRS in a young population. Our findings suggest that young asymptomatic individuals with incidental CAC should be seriously evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors despite presumption of belonging to a low cardiovascular risk category.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195061</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195061</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Correlation between coronary artery calcification by non-cardiac CT and Framingham score in young patients</title><fingerprint>95b0b8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Lichtenstein, Amichai Perlman, Shoshana Shpitzen, Ronen Durst, Dorit Shaham, Eran Leitersdorf, Auryan Szalat&lt;/p&gt;

But change in this area is a hard thing to bring about. &lt;em&gt;Biocentury&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/biocentury/regulation/2018-04-12/why-john-ioannidis-says-norm-p-values-should-shift-0005&quot;&gt;a good interview&lt;/a&gt; with someone who can tell you about that, John Ioannidis, of scientific reproducibility fame. He’s recently set off a lot of comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2676503?redirect=true&quot;&gt;with a proposal&lt;/a&gt; to lower the threshold for “significance” to p &amp;lt; 0.005, and as you’d imagine, there are some strong opinions on that. His estimate is that this would shift about a third of the published biomedical results to “suggestive” rather than significant, and his take on this is, basically “good riddance”. According to Ioannidis, a lot of those are false positives anyway, and a lot of the ones that are real are not really useful. Here’s the root of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: What is the correct way to think about a p-value?&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: A p-value is the probability or the chance that you’ll see a result that is so extreme as the one that you see if the null hypothesis is true and if there is no bias. Many people say a p-value is the chance of the null hypothesis being wrong, of some effect being there. This completely ignores the fact that you have these two ‘ifs’ that are required to interpret the p-value. So it is the chance of seeing such an extreme result, or something even more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true and if we have no bias.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he’s upfront about the fact that his suggested new threshold is not the final answer, but just an interim step towards larger reforms. He wants to see better experimental and trial designs (Bayesian and traditional), larger sample sizes, and more attention paid to potential sources of bias and to effect size. In fact, if people just go wild for the new, stricter p-values, it’ll be a loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: Don’t you have a concern that by moving to a smaller p-value you are reinforcing the fetish about p-values and driving people to create enormous data sets? With data sets that are big enough, you can get very small p-values, but that doesn’t mean the results mean anything.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: Absolutely. And this is why 80% of the literature should not be using p-values, maybe 90% of the literature. With huge amounts of data, with big data, using a p-value means nothing, because everything can be statistically significant at 0.05 or even at 0.005. &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the question is, how do you change the mentality of people who are kind of automatically hooked to using a single magic number? It’s not that the alternative approaches that are better, like using effect size and confidence intervals or using Bayesian statistics, are recent. They have been out there for a long time, but their adoption, even though it is accelerating, has not been what we want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, he thinks that p-value is the right tool for the job about 20% of the time, whereas Bayesian measures could be useful half the time, maybe even more. One instant objection to the idea of lowering p-value cutoffs is that it will make everything much more expensive and time-consuming (clinical trials, first and foremost), but his contention is that it doesn’t have to be that way. Better designs and more appropriate measures could cancel a lot of the brute-force bigger-sample stuff – and you get the impression that he’s deliberately pushing people towards those by making it too expensive to do it the old way. “We have some very strong tools that we don’t apply”, says Ioannidis, and he’s going to try to make people apply them, one way or another. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Clinical Trials</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162ce5485f1:29ae598:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523880068593</crawled><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>0.08</engagementRate><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/16/tighten-up-your-numbers</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/522/eaat6003?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Signaling current issue</title></origin><author><name>Ferrarelli, L.

We previously demonstrated that transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 5 (TRPV5) expression was decreased in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) compared with that in normal kidney tissues, a finding that was correlated with vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, but further investigations is warranted. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether VDR could regulate the expression of TRPV5 and affect proliferation and metastasis in RCC. In this study, we used lentivirus to conduct the model of VDR overexpression and knockdown caki-1 and 786-O RCC cell lines &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The results demonstrated that VDR overexpression significantly inhibited RCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis by the MTT, transwell cell migration/invasion and flow cytometry assays, respectively. However, VDR knockdown in RCC cells had the opposite effect. The RNA-sequence assay, which was assessed in caki-1 cells after VDR overexpression and knockdown, also indicated that significantly differentially expressed genes were associated with cell apoptotic, differentiation, proliferation and migration. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that VDR knockdown increased TRPV5 expression and VDR overexpression decreased TRPV5 expression in caki-1 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of TRPV5 expression suppressed the VDR knockdown-induced change in the proliferation, migration and invasion in caki-1 cells. Taken together, these findings confirmed that VDR functions as a tumour suppressor in RCC cells and suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of RCC through regulating the expression of TRPV5.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195844</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195844</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Vitamin D receptor suppresses proliferation and metastasis in renal cell carcinoma cell lines via regulating the expression of the epithelial Ca&amp;lt;sup&gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; channel TRPV5</title><fingerprint>21cb99ee</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by YongMing Chen, XinYu Liu, FaBiao Zhang, ShanFan Liao, XiYuan He, DeXiang Zhuo, HuaiBin Huang, YongYang Wu&lt;/p&gt;

The study aimed to compare the chronic eccentric-overload training effects of unilateral (lateral lunge) vs bilateral (half-squat) using an inertial device, on hypertrophy and physical performance. Twenty-seven young team sports male players performed a 4 sets of 7 repetitions of inertial eccentric overload training, biweekly for 6 weeks, distributed in unilateral lunge group (UG: age: 22.8 ± 2.9 years; body mass: 75.3 ± 8.8 kg; height: 177.3 ± 3.7 cm) and bilateral squat group (BG: age: 22.6 ± 2.7 years; body mass: 79.5 ± 12.8 kg; height: 164.2 ± 7 cm). Lower limb muscle volume, counter movement jump (CMJ), power with both (POWER), dominant (POWERd) and no-dominant leg (POWERnd), change of direction turn of 90° with dominant (COD90d) and no-dominant leg (COD90nd) and 180° (COD180d and COD180nd), and 10m sprint time (T-10m) were measured pre and post-intervention. The UG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;adductor major&lt;/i&gt; (+11.1%) and &lt;i&gt;vastus medialis&lt;/i&gt; (+12.6%) higher than BG. The BG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;vastus lateralis&lt;/i&gt; (+9.9%) and &lt;i&gt;lateral gastrocnemius&lt;/i&gt; (+9.1%) higher than UG. Both groups improved CMJ, POWER, POWERd, POWERnd, COD90 and DEC-COD90, without changes in T-10m. The UG decrease DEC-COD90nd (-21.1%) and BG increase POWER (+38.6%) substantially more than the other group. Six-weeks of unilateral / bilateral EO training induce substantial improvements in lower limbs muscle volume and functional performance, although unilateral training seems to be more effective in improving COD90 performance.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193841</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193841</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>The effects of unilateral and bilateral eccentric overload training on hypertrophy, muscle power and COD performance, and its determinants, in team sport players</title><fingerprint>89b168dc</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francisco Javier Núñez, Alfredo Santalla, Irene Carrasquila, Jose Antonio Asian, Jose Ignacio Reina, Luis Jesús Suarez-Arrones&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with endplate degeneration and the association between cartilaginous fragments and inflammatory response to the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Summary of background data &lt;p&gt;LDH often involves hyaline cartilage fragments pulled from the vertebral endplates. Modic changes are closely associated with LDH that contains hyaline cartilage, and cartilaginous endplates seem to affect resorption of the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 78 patients who underwent microscopic discectomy between 9 and 16 weeks after an occurrence of LDH were reviewed. Modic changes, disc degeneration, high-intensity zone, and vertebral corner defect were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histopathological observations of cartilaginous endplates and inflamed granulation tissue in the herniated disc were made. In cases with inflamed granulation tissue, neovascularization and macrophage infiltration were also evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Modic changes were observed in approximately one-third of the patients (26 cases: type 1, 7; type 2, 17; and type 3, 2). Cartilaginous endplates were observed in 32 cases (41%) and in the majority of cases with Modic changes compared with cases without Modic changes (65%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). Although inflamed granulation tissue was observed in 60 cases (77%), no significant differences were detected in patient age and the composition of the herniated material.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with endplate degeneration and the association between cartilaginous fragments and inflammatory response to the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Summary of background data &lt;p&gt;LDH often involves hyaline cartilage fragments pulled from the vertebral endplates. Modic changes are closely associated with LDH that contains hyaline cartilage, and cartilaginous endplates seem to affect resorption of the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 78 patients who underwent microscopic discectomy between 9 and 16 weeks after an occurrence of LDH were reviewed. Modic changes, disc degeneration, high-intensity zone, and vertebral corner defect were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histopathological observations of cartilaginous endplates and inflamed granulation tissue in the herniated disc were made. In cases with inflamed granulation tissue, neovascularization and macrophage infiltration were also evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Modic changes were observed in approximately one-third of the patients (26 cases: type 1, 7; type 2, 17; and type 3, 2). Cartilaginous endplates were observed in 32 cases (41%) and in the majority of cases with Modic changes compared with cases without Modic changes (65%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). Although inflamed granulation tissue was observed in 60 cases (77%), no significant differences were detected in patient age and the composition of the herniated material. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that fewer CD34-positive capillaries and CD68-positive cells were found in cases with cartilaginous fragments compared with those without cartilaginous fragments (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In addition, a higher immunoreactivity to CD34 and CD68 was found in herniated discs &amp;lt;25% of whose area was occupied by cartilaginous endplates compared with discs whose area was occupied at 25% or more (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;There is an association between LDH with endplate degeneration and cartilaginous herniation, with Modic type 2 predominating.

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings. However, tactile suppression was comparable between conditions arguing against the hypothesis that it frees capacities for processing other relevant visual signals.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>The role of visual processing on tactile suppression</title><fingerprint>ba854dbd</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression could be discussed as an adaption that promotes repair and counteracts cell damage. Myoglobin is released upon muscle damage of several pathways. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the expression of HSP70 in kidney, heart and brain and of myoglobin in the kidney were associated with the cause of death and the survival times after lethal intoxications with three of the drugs most widely used in our local area (Saxony, Germany) as well as after fatal traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively collected kidney, heart and brain samples of 50 autopsy cases with toxicological proved lethal intoxication (main drugs methamphetamine, morphine, alcohol), 14 TBI cases and 15 fatalities with acute myocardial injury in age- and gender-matched compilations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our main findings suggest that HSP70 is associated with hyperthermal and other stress factors of most cell populations. HSP70 expressions in kidney and heart muscle are useful for a differentiation between fatal intoxications and cases without toxicological influence (p &amp;lt; 0.05). There were significant differences in the cerebral expression patterns between methamphetamine- and morphine-associated deaths compared to alcohol fatalities (p &amp;lt; 0.05). An intensive staining of HSP70 in the pericontusional zone and the hippocampus after TBI (especially neuronal and vascular) was shown even after short survival times and may be useful as an additional marker in questions of vitality or wound age. A relevant myoglobin decoration of renal tubules was only shown for methamphetamine abuse in the study presented.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In sum, the immunohistochemical characteristics presented can be supportive for determining final death circumstances and minimal trauma survival times but are not isolated usefully for the detection of drug- or trauma-induced hyperthermia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194442</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194442</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Drug- and/or trauma-induced hyperthermia?

Systemic inflammation associated with COPD, is often hypothesised as a causal factor. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases play a key role in the inflammatory pathogenesis of COPD and atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study sought to evaluate the effects of losmapimod, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, on vascular inflammation and endothelial function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with systemic inflammation (defined by plasma fibrinogen &gt;2·8g/l).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II trial that recruited COPD patients with plasma fibrinogen &gt;2.8g/l. Participants were randomly assigned by an online program to losmapimod 7·5mg or placebo tablets twice daily for 16 weeks. Pre- and post-dose &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography co-registered with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) imaging of the aorta and carotid arteries was performed to quantify arterial inflammation, defined by the tissue-to-blood ratio (TBR) from scan images. Endothelial function was assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We screened 160 patients, of whom, 36 and 37 were randomised to losmapimod or placebo. The treatment effect of losmapimod compared to placebo was not significant, at -0·05 for TBR (95% CI: -0·17, 0·07), p = 0·42, and +0·40% for FMD (95% CI: -1·66, 2·47), p = 0·70. The frequency of adverse events reported was similar in both treatment groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this plasma fibrinogen-enriched study, losmapimod had no effect on arterial inflammation and endothelial function at 16 weeks of treatment, although it was well tolerated with no significant safety concerns. These findings do not support the concept that losmapimod is an effective treatment for the adverse cardiovascular manifestations of COPD.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194197</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194197</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>The p38 mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor losmapimod in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with systemic inflammation, stratified by fibrinogen: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial</title><fingerprint>aadd82fc</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Fisk, Joseph Cheriyan, Divya Mohan, Julia Forman, Kaisa M.

Thorough understanding of biodiversity is a fundamental prerequisite for biological research. A lack of taxonomic knowledge and species misidentifications are particularly critical for conservation. Here we present an example of &lt;i&gt;Potamogeton floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, the Florida Pondweed, an endangered taxon endemic to a small area in the Florida panhandle, whose taxonomic status remained controversial for more than a century, and all previous attempts to elucidate its identity have failed. We applied molecular approaches to tackle the origin of the mysterious taxon and supplemented them with morphological and anatomical investigations of both historical herbarium collections and plants recently collected in the type area for a comprehensive taxonomic reassessment. Sequencing of two nuclear ribosomal markers and one chloroplast non-coding spacer resulted in the surprising discovery that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;floridanus&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pulcher&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;, with the former being the maternal parent. The hybrid colony is currently geographically isolated from the distribution range of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;. We show that previous molecular analyses have failed to reveal its hybrid identity due to inadequate nuclear DNA sequence editing. This is an example how the uncritical use of automized sequence reads can hamper molecular species identifications and also affect phylogenetic tree construction and interpretation. This unique hybrid taxon, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;×floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, adds another case study to the debate on hybrid protection; consequences for its conservation are discussed.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195241</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195241</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>The endangered Florida pondweed (&amp;lt;i&gt;Potamogeton floridanus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) is a hybrid: Why we need to understand biodiversity thoroughly</title><fingerprint>2f33a0a6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zdeněk Kaplan, Judith Fehrer, Veronika Bambasová, C.

Frailty is a risk factor for disability and mortality, and is more prevalent among African American (AA) elderly than whites. We examine frailty in middle-aged racially and economically diverse adults, and investigate how race, poverty and frailty are associated with mortality. Data were from 2541 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study in Baltimore, Maryland; 35–64 years old at initial assessment (56% women; 58% AA). Frailty was assessed using a modified FRAIL scale of fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness and weight loss, and compared with difficulties in physical functioning and daily activities. Frailty prevalence was calculated across race and age groups, and associations with survival were assessed by Cox Regression. 278 participants were frail (11%); 924 pre-frail (36%); 1339 not frail (53%). For those aged 45–54, a higher proportion of whites (13%) than AAs (8%) were frail; while the proportions were similar for those 55–64 (14%,16%). Frailty was associated with overall survival with an average follow-up of 6.6 years, independent of race, sex and poverty status (HR = 2.30; 95%CI 1.67–3.18). In this sample of economically and racially diverse older adults, the known association of frailty prevalence and age differed across race with whites having higher prevalence at younger ages. Frailty was associated with survival beyond the risk factors of race and poverty status in this middle-aged group. Early recognition of frailty at these younger ages may provide an effective method for preventing or delaying disabilities.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195637</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195637</link><published>1523394000000</published><title>Frailty in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of middle-aged Americans in Baltimore</title><fingerprint>743ddfcb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Felicia R.

The hemodynamic effects of intravenous (IV) paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are unknown. We performed a prospective single center placebo controlled randomized study with parallel group design in adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Participants received paracetamol (1 gram) IV or placebo (an equal volume of 0.9% saline) preoperatively followed by two postoperative doses 6 hours apart. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in systolic (SBP) 30 minutes after the preoperative infusion, analysed using an ANCOVA model. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB), and other key hemodynamic variables after each infusion. All other endpoints were analysed using random-effect generalized least squares regression modelling with individual patients treated as random effects. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to receive paracetamol (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). Post preoperative infusion, paracetamol decreased SBP by a mean (SD) of 13 (18) mmHg, p = 0.02, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (11) mmHg with saline. Paracetamol decreased MAP and DBP by a mean (SD) of 9 (12) mmHg and 8 (9) mmHg (p = 0.01 and 0.02), respectively, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (8) mmHg and 0 (6) mmHg with placebo. Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in pressure or flow based hemodynamic parameters in both groups.

The hemodynamic effects of intravenous (IV) paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are unknown. We performed a prospective single center placebo controlled randomized study with parallel group design in adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Participants received paracetamol (1 gram) IV or placebo (an equal volume of 0.9% saline) preoperatively followed by two postoperative doses 6 hours apart. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in systolic (SBP) 30 minutes after the preoperative infusion, analysed using an ANCOVA model. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB), and other key hemodynamic variables after each infusion. All other endpoints were analysed using random-effect generalized least squares regression modelling with individual patients treated as random effects. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to receive paracetamol (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). Post preoperative infusion, paracetamol decreased SBP by a mean (SD) of 13 (18) mmHg, p = 0.02, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (11) mmHg with saline. Paracetamol decreased MAP and DBP by a mean (SD) of 9 (12) mmHg and 8 (9) mmHg (p = 0.01 and 0.02), respectively, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (8) mmHg and 0 (6) mmHg with placebo. Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in pressure or flow based hemodynamic parameters in both groups. This study provides high quality evidence that the administration of IV paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery causes a transient decrease in preoperative blood pressure when administered before surgery but no adverse hemodynamic effects when administered in the postoperative setting.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195931</canonicalUrl><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aec:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195266</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Jinlin Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinlin Liu, Bin Zhu, Ying Mao&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;A large number of programs have been implemented in many countries to increase the healthcare workforce recruitment in rural and remote areas. Rural early exposure programs for medical students have been shown to be effective strategies. However, no related studies have been reported before in China. This study was carried out to determine the association between medical students’ participation in rural clinical clerkships and their intentions to choose rural medical work after graduation from western medical schools in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on a two-stage random sampling method, the cross-sectional survey was carried out in ten western provinces in China. A brief questionnaire filled in by medical students was used for data collection. A total of 4278 medical students participated in the study. The response rate was approximately 90.34%. Pearson’s chi-squared tests and binary logistic regression analyses were performed for data analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Approximately 52.0% of medical students disclosed intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation. Only one in five participants had experience with a rural clinical clerkship. Rural clinical clerkships were significantly associated with medical students’ intentions to work in rural medical institutions (OR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.05–1.46); further analyses indicated that such clerkships only had a significant impact among the medical students with an urban background (OR: 2.10, 95%CI: 1.48–2.97). In terms of the sociodemographic characteristics, younger age, low level of parental education, majoring in general practice, and studying in low-level medical schools increased the odds of having intentions to engage in rural medical work among medical students; however, rural origins was the only positive univariate predictor. In addition, the predictors of intentions to choose rural medical work were different between medical students with a rural background and those with an urban background.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural clinical clerkship is likely to increase the odds of having intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation among medical students in western China, especially for those with an urban background. Related policy makers could consider developing compulsory rural clerkship programs and implement them among medical students to increase early rural exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195266</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195266</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Association between rural clinical clerkship and medical students’ intentions to choose rural medical work after graduation: A cross-sectional study in western China</title><fingerprint>f150cd78</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinlin Liu, Bin Zhu, Ying Mao&lt;/p&gt;

Climate change is expected to affect resource-consumer interactions underlying stability in polar food webs. Polar benthic organisms have adapted to the marked seasonality characterising their habitats by concentrating foraging and reproductive activity in summer months, when inputs from sympagic and pelagic producers increase. While this enables the persistence of biodiverse food webs, the mechanisms underlying changes in resource use and nutrient transfer are poorly understood. Thus, our understanding of how temporal and spatial variations in the supply of resources may affect food web structure and functioning is limited. By means of C and N isotopic analyses of two key Antarctic benthic consumers (&lt;i&gt;Adamussium colbecki&lt;/i&gt;, Bivalvia, and &lt;i&gt;Sterechinus neumayeri&lt;/i&gt;, Echinoidea) and Bayesian mixing models, we describe changes in trophic niche and nutrient transfer across trophic levels associated with the long- and short-term diet and body size of specimens sampled in midsummer in both shallow and deep waters. Samplings occurred soon after the sea-ice broke up at Tethys Bay, an area characterised by extreme seasonality in sea-ice coverage and productivity in the Ross Sea. In the long term, the trophic niche was broader and variation between specimens was greater, with intermediate-size specimens generally consuming a higher number of resources than small and large specimens. The coupling of energy channels in the food web was consequently more direct than in the short term. Sediment and benthic algae were more frequently consumed in the long term, before the sea-ice broke up, while consumers specialised on sympagic algae and plankton in the short term. Regardless of the time scale, sympagic algae were more frequently consumed in shallow waters, while plankton was more frequently consumed in deep waters. Our results suggest a strong temporal relationship between resource availability and the trophic niche of benthic consumers in Antarctica. Potential climate-driven changes in the timing and quality of nutrient inputs may have profound implications for the structure of polar food webs and the persistence of their constituent species, which have adapted their trophic niches to a highly predictable schedule of resource inputs.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194796</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194796</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Time- and depth-wise trophic niche shifts in Antarctic benthos</title><fingerprint>4f3e0082</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Edoardo Calizza, Giulio Careddu, Simona Sporta Caputi, Loreto Rossi, Maria Letizia Costantini&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Azathioprine is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. Genetic polymorphisms and activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) have been associated with azathioprine efficacy and toxicity in several populations. We investigated whether these associations also exist for ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) patients, who receive azathioprine maintenance therapy after remission induction with cyclophosphamide.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;207 AAV patients treated with cyclophosphamide induction and azathioprine maintenance therapy were included and followed for 60 months. &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype and tertiles of TPMT activity were compared to relapse free survival and occurrence of adverse events, particularly leukopenia. Multivariable regression was performed to account for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In univariable analysis, relapse free survival was not significantly associated with &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype (P = 0.41) or TPMT activity (P = 0.07), although it tended to be longer in lower tertiles of TPMT activity. There was no significant association of TPMT genotype and activity with occurrence of any adverse event. In multiple regression, leukocyte counts at the end of cyclophosphamide induction were related to risk of leukopenia during azathioprine therapy [P&amp;lt;0.001; OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.43–0.68)] and risk of relapse during follow-up [P = 0.001; HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.29)] irrespective of TMPT genotype or activity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TPMT genotype and activity were not independent predictors of relapse, and could not predict leukopenia or other adverse effects from azathioprine.

Chronic stress is an important factor influencing people’s health. It usually causes endocrinal disorders and a decline in reproduction in females. Although studies of both human and animals suggest a detrimental effect of stress on reproduction, the influence of chronic stress on the ovarian reservation and follicular development is still not clear. In this study, a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of stress on ovarian reservation and follicular development and explore the underlying mechanism. In this study, after 8 weeks of CRS, primordial follicles were excessively activated in the ovaries of the CRS group compared with the control group. Further results showed that the activation of primordial follicles induced by CRS was involved in the increasing expression level of Kit ligand and its receptor Kit and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide released due to stress, which plays an important role in regulating follicle development. A high level of serum CRH was detected in the CRS mouse model, and the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the mRNA level of its main receptor CRHR1increased in the ovaries of the CRS mouse group. Moreover, 100nM CRH significantly improved the activation of primordial follicles in newborn mouse ovaries &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. These results demonstrated that CRS could induce immoderate activation of primordial follicles accompanied by the activation of Kit-PI3K signaling, in which CRH might be an important endocrine factor.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194894</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194894</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>Chronic restraint stress induces excessive activation of primordial follicles in mice ovaries</title><fingerprint>63232578</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Minhua Xu, Junyan Sun, Qian Wang, Qiuwan Zhang, Chunsheng Wei, Dongmei Lai&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the increasingly recognized importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a regulator of tumor progression, only few &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models have been developed to systematically study the effects of TME on tumor behavior in a controlled manner. Here we developed a three-dimensional (3D) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model that recapitulates the physical and compositional characteristics of Glioblastoma (GBM) extracellular matrix (ECM) and incorporates brain stromal cells such as astrocytes and endothelial cell precursors. The model was used to evaluate the effect of TME components on migration and survival of various patient-derived GBM cell lines (GBM10, GBM43 and GBAM1) in the context of STAT3 inhibition. Migration analysis of GBM within the 3D &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model demonstrated that the presence of astrocytes significantly increases the migration of GBM, while presence of endothelial precursors has varied effects on the migration of different GBM cell lines. Given the role of the tumor microenvironment as a regulator of STAT3 activity, we tested the effect of the STAT3 inhibitor SH-4-54 on GBM migration and survival. SH-4-54 inhibited STAT3 activity and reduced 3D migration and survival of GBM43 but had no effect on GBM10. SH-4-54 treatment drastically reduced the viability of the stem-like line GBAM1 in liquid culture, but its effect lessened in presence of a 3D ECM and stromal cells. Our results highlight the interplay between the ECM and stromal cells in the microenvironment with the cancer cells and indicate that the impact of these relationships may differ for GBM cells of varying genetic and clinical histories.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194183</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194183</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Presence of stromal cells in a bioengineered tumor microenvironment alters glioblastoma migration and response to STAT3 inhibition</title><fingerprint>e450ba59</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by R.

Our results highlight the interplay between the ECM and stromal cells in the microenvironment with the cancer cells and indicate that the impact of these relationships may differ for GBM cells of varying genetic and clinical histories.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194183</canonicalUrl><updated>1521752400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123910:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Synthesis_and_Biological_Evaluation_of_the_Antimicrobial_Natural_Product_Lipoxazolidinone_A/6103607</originId><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>The lipoxazolidinone family of marine natural products, with an unusual 4-oxazolidinone heterocycle at their core, represents a new scaffold for antimicrobial discovery; however, questions regarding their mechanism of action and high lipophilicity have likely slowed follow-up studies.

Adapting community-based protected areas to local context and evaluating their success across a range of possible socio-economic and ecological outcomes depends, in part, on understanding the perceptions of local actors. This article presents results from a mixed methods study that focuses on how and why religious identity, a prominent aspect of Ghanaian culture, is related to perceptions of the performance of several Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs). CREMAs are a form of Ghanaian protected area that emphasizes community participation and a range of socio-economic and ecological objectives. Using importance-satisfaction analysis, large-scale survey results show that respondents that identify as Christians consistently assign greater importance to CREMA outcomes than do those that identify with Traditional religions. Education and whether respondents were native to an area (both of which were correlated with religious identity) were also systematically related to perceptions of CREMA importance, with those that are educated and non-native to an area tending to assign higher importance to CREMA outcomes. Follow up focus group participants from the Avu Lagoon CREMA suggest that the patterns result from differing ‘openness’ to new ideas, relative dependence on natural resources, acceptance of Traditional practices associated with conservation, and a sense, for some, that ecological conditions are divinely ordained. Christianity, education and non-nativity are associated with much larger performance gaps, particularly with respect to socio-economic impacts. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for conservation interventions and the use of perceptions in assessing protected area performance.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195498</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195498</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Religion and perceptions of community-based conservation in Ghana, West Africa</title><fingerprint>9befc27c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Grant Murray, Andrew Agyare&lt;/p&gt;

After carotid artery stenting, the procurement of information about blood flow redistribution among brain-feeding arteries and its time trend is essential to understanding a patient’s physiological background and to determine their care regimen. Cerebral blood flow has been measured twice following carotid artery stenting in few previous studies, with some discrepancies in the results. The purpose of this study was to measure cerebral blood flow at multiple time points after carotid artery stenting, and to elucidate the time trend of cerebral blood flow and redistribution among arteries. Blood flow rates in 11 subjects were measured preoperatively, at one day, one week, and about three months, respectively after carotid artery stenting by using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. The target vessels were the bilateral internal carotid arteries, the basilar artery, and the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. Lumen was semi-automatically defined using an algorithm utilizing pulsatility. The results showed that blood flow rates in the stented internal carotid artery and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery increased following carotid artery stenting. Blood flow rates in the contralateral internal carotid artery and the basilar artery gradually declined, and they were lower than the preoperative values at three months after stenting. The sum of blood flow rates of the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery increased after carotid artery stenting, and then decreased over the next three months. There was no significant change in the blood flow rate in the contralateral middle cerebral artery. From these results, it was concluded that redistribution among the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery occurs after carotid artery stenting, and that it takes months thereafter to reach another equilibrium.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195099</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195099</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Multiple blood flow measurements before and after carotid artery stenting via phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging: An observational study</title><fingerprint>ba541727</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hisashi Tanaka, Yoshiyuki Watanabe, Hajime Nakamura, Hiroto Takahashi, Atsuko Arisawa, Takuya Fujiwara, Chisato Matsuo, Noriyuki Tomiyama&lt;/p&gt;

We evaluated the feasibility and safety of nictitating membrane fixation to address reduced contact lens stability by the nictitating membrane in a rabbit model. Under general anesthesia, twelve animals received a horizontal mattress suture between the nictitating membrane and the upper eyelid of one eye. To assess the effects of this technique and secondary side effects, contact lens stability test, Schirmer tear test, tear break-up time measurement, eye tissue pathology and morphology were evaluated. Contact lens stability was increased after nictitating membrane fixation. The percentage of contact lens retention in the nictitating membrane fixed rabbit after 4 hours was 90% whereas that in the untreated rabbit was 42.5%. In addition, there were no significant differences in tear quantity and quality between the fixed and untreated eyes. Furthermore, no remarkable pathological lesions were found in gross observation during the 1-month time period or the following pathological examination. In this study, we demonstrated that nictitating membrane fixation increases contact lens stability without specific side effects using a rabbit model. This minimally invasive procedure could be useful when designing animal models for testing new contact lenses and has potential to apply to other biomaterial research on the ocular surface.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194795</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194795</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Nictitating membrane fixation improves stability of the contact lens on the animal corneal surface</title><fingerprint>bfc59809</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

That, put simply, is a different crystalline form, and any given substance can have several. Or a lot more than several. I don’t know what the record is for any single compound, but it’s way up into the dozens, and you never know when a new one might show up. You can get these different forms through all sorts of variations in the way the compound is crystallized or precipitated: different solvents, different temperatures, different types of stirring (yes indeed), different concentrations. . .and we haven’t even gotten to hydrates and solvates, where molecules of water or other solvents are incorporated into the crystal structure as it forms. And &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; can have polymorphs in turn, or different ratios of water and solvent, and there’s just no end to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphs can behave completely differently from each other. The same substance, completely pure, can come out looking like several unmistakable crystal types (rods, prisms, plates), in different crystalline space groups, with completely different melting points and solubility behavior. Past blog posts on this are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/10/22/phenylalanine_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/08/25/polymorphs_and_salts_india_raises_an_eyebrow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2011/01/12/gassing_your_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/01/novartis_loses_the_glivec_patent_fight_in_india&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and as that last one illustrates, this is definitely not something of just theoretical interest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=17333&quot;&gt;The saga&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-HIV drug Ritonavir is the classic example. That altered solubility behavior is of tremendous importance for drug dosing, and in Ritonavir’s case, a more stable (and less desirable!) polymorph appeared and threatened to disrupt the entire supply of the drug, because after a while, it was appearing more and more in the production line. “More stable”, of course, can easily mean “so stable it would rather not dissolve and get into the bloodstream”. Polymorphs themselves can be patented separately over such meaningful differences, as can methods for their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even very simple compounds can show grindingly complex behavior. Aspirin, for example, exists in two polymorphs (so far) that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.200603373&quot;&gt;so similar&lt;/a&gt; that they can both show up &lt;em&gt;in the same single crystal&lt;/em&gt;, and it takes good X-ray data (and a good X-ray crystallographer) to work out what’s going on. One of those past blog post links is about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/blog/post-42/&quot;&gt;trickiness of phenylalanine&lt;/a&gt;, a substance you’d think had been studied to pieces by now. But as that link shows, D-ribose is in the same category: the crystallographic literature for years was all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about something even more simple than those? I refer to the most simple amino acid of all, glycine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.201800741&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has some details on its polymorphs, and the ridiculously subtle effects that cause them to form. There are three that form under “normal” conditions from aqueous solution, and while the gamma one is the most thermodynamically stable, the alpha one is kinetically favored. Adding small amounts of simple alcohols to the aqueous solution starts producing mixtures of the alpha and beta forms, though, and eventually, as the alcohol concentration goes up, you only get the beta form. All classic polymorph behavior. But why? Here’s what the authors found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the alpha-form starts growing in a pyramidal shape, just as it usually does, but then starts incorporating methanol-solvated glycine molecules into its growing lattice. This buries methanol molecules into the crystal as it continues forming, and creates zones of higher polarity because of the different orientation of those solvated glycines (and the slight deformations in the nearest neighbor glycine arrangements as well). The normal arrangement in the crystal is a sort of “canceled-out” glycine dimer, but that gets disrupted into a more polarizable form. That’s the origin of the pyroelectric effect they’re able to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this starts happening, that developing surface of the crystal ends up “poisoned”, as some molecular dynamic simulations suggest, by the methanols incorporated into the lattice. The new surface doesn’t recognize the usual glycine-dimer form so readily, and further growth is inhibited – you see truncated pyramids of the alpha-form that have stopped in their tracks. Meanwhile, the beta-form end up with one surface (a more hydrophilic one) similarly poisoned and inhibited, but another one (a more hydrophobic one) is totally unaffected, so the crystal grows more rapidly along that face and produces long rods of the beta-form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of detail answers some questions and raises others. There are probably all sorts of metastable crystal forms (and crystal surfaces) showing up in complex polymorph situations, and the ability to see and characterize these things will (as in this case) give us a better physical picture of what’s going on. But predicting such behavior is another thing entirely. You’d hope as we start to pile up enough detail that predictive power will start to emerge (hello, machine learning). That’s a reasonable hope, but there’s no reason that things have to work out that way. The whole “Big Data” effort across various sciences is putting that view of the world to the test, and sometimes it’s going to work out and sometimes it isn’t. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Chemical News</item><item>In Silico</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1626d03ee40:6b468a1:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522247396928</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/28/down-at-the-crystal-surface</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194607</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Román Rodríguez-Aguilar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Román Rodríguez-Aguilar&lt;/p&gt;
The maternal mortality situation is analyzed in México as an indicator that reflects the social development level of the country and was one of the millennial development objectives. The effect of a maternal death in the related social group has multiplier effects, since it involves family dislocation, economic impact and disruption of the orphans&apos; normal social development.

The maternal mortality situation is analyzed in México as an indicator that reflects the social development level of the country and was one of the millennial development objectives. The effect of a maternal death in the related social group has multiplier effects, since it involves family dislocation, economic impact and disruption of the orphans&apos; normal social development. Two perspectives that causes of maternal mortality were analyzed, on one hand, their relationship with social determinants and on the other, factors directly related to the health system. Evidence shows that comparing populations based on group of selected variables according to social conditions and health care access, statistically significant differences prevail according to education and marginalization levels, and access to medical care. In addition, the Age-Period-Cohort model raised, shows significant progress in terms of a downward trend in maternal mortality in a generational level. Those women born before 1980 had a greater probability of maternal death in relation to recent generations, which is a reflection of the improvement in social determinants and in the Health System. The age effect shows a problem in maternal mortality in women under 15 years old, so teen pregnancy is a priority in health and must be addressed in short term. There is no clear evidence of a period effect.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194607</canonicalUrl><updated>1521666000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087ee:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196160</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>C.

However, analyses are complicated by base-modifications in ancient DNA molecules that result in errors in DNA sequences. These errors are particularly common near the ends of sequences and pose a challenge for genotype calling. Results: I describe an expectation-maximization algorithm that estimates genotype frequencies and errors along sequences to allow for accurate genotype calling from ancient sequences.

However, analyses are complicated by base-modifications in ancient DNA molecules that result in errors in DNA sequences. These errors are particularly common near the ends of sequences and pose a challenge for genotype calling. Results: I describe an expectation-maximization algorithm that estimates genotype frequencies and errors along sequences to allow for accurate genotype calling from ancient sequences. The implementation of this method, called snpAD, performs well on high-coverage ancient data, as shown by simulations and by subsampling the data of a high-coverage Neandertal genome.

Explicit structural inference is one key point to improve the accuracy of scene parsing. Meanwhile, adversarial training method is able to reinforce spatial contiguity in output segmentations. To take both advantages of the structural learning and adversarial training simultaneously, we propose a novel deep learning network architecture called Structural Inference Embedded Adversarial Networks (SIEANs) for pixel-wise scene labeling. The generator of our SIEANs, a novel designed scene parsing network, makes full use of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks to learn the global contextual information of objects in four different directions from RGB-(D) images, which is able to describe the (three-dimensional) spatial distributions of objects in a more comprehensive and accurate way. To further improve the performance, we explore the adversarial training method to optimize the generator along with a discriminator, which can not only detect and correct higher-order inconsistencies between the predicted segmentations and corresponding ground truths, but also exploit full advantages of the generator by fine-tuning its parameters so as to obtain higher consistencies. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SIEANs is able to achieve a better performance on PASCAL VOC 2012, SIFT FLOW, PASCAL Person-Part, Cityscapes, Stanford Background, NYUDv2, and SUN-RGBD datasets compared to the most of state-of-the-art methods.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Structural inference embedded adversarial networks for scene parsing</title><fingerprint>97df91ae</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by ZeYu Wang, YanXia Wu, ShuHui Bu, PengCheng Han, GuoYin Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Eliminating this problem requires development of comprehensive educational resources. Here we present a community-driven framework that enables modern, interactive teaching of data analytics in life sciences and facilitates the development of training materials.

Eliminating this problem requires development of comprehensive educational resources.

Polyploidization has played an important role in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly at the base of Teleostei–an enormously successful ray-finned fish group with additional genome doublings on lower taxonomic levels. The investigation of post-polyploid genome dynamics might provide important clues about the evolution and ecology of respective species and can help to decipher the role of polyploidy &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on speciation. Few studies have attempted to investigate the dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences in the post-polyploid genome using molecular cytogenetic tools in fishes, though recent efforts demonstrated their usefulness. The demonstrably monophyletic freshwater loach family Botiidae, branching to evolutionary diploid and tetraploid lineages separated &gt;25 Mya, offers a suited model group for comparing the long-term repetitive DNA evolution. For this, we integrated phylogenetic analyses with cytogenetical survey involving Giemsa- and Chromomycin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/DAPI stainings and fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization with 5S/45S rDNA, U2 snDNA and telomeric probes in representative sample of 12 botiid species.
The karyotypes of all diploids were composed of 2n = 50 chromosomes, while majority of tetraploids had 2n = 4x = 100, with only subtle interspecific karyotype differences. The exceptional karyotype of &lt;i&gt;Botia dario&lt;/i&gt; (2n = 4x = 96) suggested centric fusions behind the 2n reduction. Variable patterns of FISH signals revealed cases of intraspecific polymorphisms, rDNA amplification, variable degree of correspondence with CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and almost no phylogenetic signal. In tetraploids, either additivity or loci gain/loss was recorded. Despite absence of classical interstitial telomeric sites, large blocks of interspersed rDNA/telomeric regions were found in diploids only.
We uncovered different molecular drives of studied repetitive DNA classes within botiid genomes as well as the advanced stage of the re-diploidization process in tetraploids. Our results may contribute to link genomic approach with molecular cytogenetic analyses in addressing the origin and mechanism of this polyploidization event.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195054</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195054</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Dynamics of tandemly repeated DNA sequences during evolution of diploid and tetraploid botiid loaches (Teleostei: Cobitoidea: Botiidae)</title><fingerprint>b6e8f653</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandr Sember, Jörg Bohlen, Vendula Šlechtová, Marie Altmanová, Šárka Pelikánová, Petr Ráb&lt;/p&gt;

Leakage at the nanotube-membrane interface may explain the discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Biochemistry, Materials Science, Physics</item></keywords><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c56:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/eaap9173.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0003-0</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Zhuzhen Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Differential glucose requirement in skin homeostasis and injury identifies a therapeutic target for psoriasis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differential glucose requirement in skin homeostasis and injury identifies a therapeutic target for psoriasis, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0003-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0003-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Keratinocytes require glucose for injury- or inflammation-driven but not homeostatic proliferation, and glucose-transport blockade blocks psoriasis-like pathology in experimental models.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/_ARkUlLuCi8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0003-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/_ARkUlLuCi8/s41591-018-0003-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0003-0</link><published>1523862000000</published><title>Differential glucose requirement in skin homeostasis and injury identifies a therapeutic target for psoriasis</title><fingerprint>96cee42a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Differential glucose requirement in skin homeostasis and injury identifies a therapeutic target for psoriasis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differential glucose requirement in skin homeostasis and injury identifies a therapeutic target for psoriasis, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0003-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0003-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Keratinocytes require glucose for injury- or inflammation-driven but not homeostatic proliferation, and glucose-transport blockade blocks psoriasis-like pathology in experimental models.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/_ARkUlLuCi8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_162cf1330b4:2a3da2a:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0003-0/MediaObjects/41591_2018_3_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><height>450</height></visual><crawled>1523892564148</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3255.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Xinxing Zhang, Kevin M.

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system to bimolecular complementation (‘EM split-fluorescent protein’), for localisation of protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrmHIECypRw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e9:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</canonicalUrl><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aed:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Diana Klakotskaia</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Klakotskaia, Cansu Agca, Rachel A.

Transgenic rat models of Alzheimer’s disease were used to examine differences in memory and brain histology. Double transgenic female rats (APP+PS1) over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and single transgenic rats (APP21) over-expressing human APP were compared with wild type Fischer rats (WT). The Barnes maze assessed learning and memory and showed that both APP21 and APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors than the WT rats during the acquisition phase, signifying slower learning. Additionally, the APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors following a retention interval, indicating impaired memory compared to both the APP21 and WT rats. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against amyloid-β (Aβ) showed extensive and mostly diffuse Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and dense plaques that contained tau in the cortex of the brains of the APP+PS1 rats. Furthermore, the APP+PS1 rats also showed vascular changes, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy with extensive Aβ deposits in cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessel walls and venous collagenosis. In addition to the Aβ accumulation observed in arterial, venous, and capillary walls, APP+PS1 rats also displayed enlarged blood vessels and perivascular space. Overall, the brain histopathology and behavioral assessment showed that the APP+PS1 rats demonstrated behavioral characteristics and vascular changes similar to those commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Memory deficiency, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and amyloid-β plaques in APP+PS1 double transgenic rat model of Alzheimer’s disease</title><fingerprint>82314836</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Klakotskaia, Cansu Agca, Rachel A.

Adherent cells sense the physical properties of their environment via focal adhesions.

Genetic differences contribute to variations in the immune response mounted by different individuals to a pathogen. Such differential response can influence the spread of infectious disease, indicating why such diseases impact some populations more than others. Here, we study the impact of population-level genetic heterogeneity on the epidemic spread of different strains of H1N1 influenza. For a population with known HLA class-I allele frequency and for a given H1N1 viral strain, we classify individuals into sub-populations according to their level of susceptibility to infection. Our core hypothesis is that the susceptibility of a given individual to a disease such as H1N1 influenza is inversely proportional to the number of high affinity viral epitopes the individual can present. This number can be extracted from the HLA genetic profile of the individual. We use ethnicity-specific HLA class-I allele frequency data, together with genome sequences of various H1N1 viral strains, to obtain susceptibility sub-populations for 61 ethnicities and 81 viral strains isolated in 2009, as well as 85 strains isolated in other years. We incorporate these data into a multi-compartment SIR model to analyse the epidemic dynamics for these (ethnicity, viral strain) epidemic pairs. Our results show that HLA allele profiles which lead to a large spread in individual susceptibility values can act as a protective barrier against the spread of influenza. We predict that populations skewed such that a small number of highly susceptible individuals coexist with a large number of less susceptible ones, should exhibit smaller outbreaks than populations with the same average susceptibility but distributed more uniformly across individuals. Our model tracks some well-known qualitative trends of influenza spread worldwide, suggesting that HLA genetic diversity plays a crucial role in determining the spreading potential of different influenza viral strains across populations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x5hYH_0EN7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1521666000000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16249acad20:4027a:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Narmada Sambaturu, Sumanta Mukherjee, Martín López-García, Carmen Molina-París, Gautam I.

Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bezier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d5:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephanie A.

For organisms with complex life histories, carry-over effects (COEs) can manifest between life stages, when conditions experienced by one stage influence the next, as well as trans-generationally, when the parental environment affects offspring. Here we used multiple global change-associated stressors to examine both forms of COE simultaneously in an intertidal limpet with mixed development (i.e. planktonic larvae hatch from benthic egg masses). Adult &lt;i&gt;Siphonaria australis&lt;/i&gt; were subjected to four treatments over four weeks: an ambient control, a treatment featuring elevated water temperature (25°C) and UVB (1.7 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;), a copper pollution treatment (5.0 μg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and a treatment incorporating all three stressors. Egg masses laid by these adults were then redistributed among the same four treatments (producing 16 adult-to-egg treatment histories) and stressed until hatching. Finally, hatching larvae were reared under ambient conditions for 24 days. While adult survivorship was unaffected by treatment, embryonic viability in egg masses responded strongly to egg mass treatment, as well as parental stress exposure, therefore displaying trans-generational COEs. These trans-generational COEs interacted with COEs originating in egg masses to produce highly context-dependent hatching sizes and larval growth. This demonstrates that the performance of a given organism at a given time reflects not only conditions experienced during embryonic development, but also those of the parental generation, and suggests that COEs play an important but underestimated role in responses to global change scenarios.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194645</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194645</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Global change scenarios trigger carry-over effects across life stages and generations of the intertidal limpet, &amp;lt;i&gt;Siphonaria australis&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>3e0f4bdc</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gustav M.

This demonstrates that the performance of a given organism at a given time reflects not only conditions experienced during embryonic development, but also those of the parental generation, and suggests that COEs play an important but underestimated role in responses to global change scenarios.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194645</canonicalUrl><updated>1521666000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087ef:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01694</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Ke-Bin Huang, Feng-Yang Wang, Xiao-Ming Tang, Hai-Wen Feng, Zhen-Feng Chen, Yan-Cheng Liu, You-Nian Liu, Hong Liang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01694/20180411/images/medium/jm-2017-01694k_0014.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01694&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

To unveil novel global changes associated with corpus luteum (CL) maturation, we analyzed transcriptome data for the bovine CL on days 4 and 11, representing the developing vs. mature gland. Our analyses revealed 681 differentially expressed genes (363 and 318 on day 4 and 11, respectively), with ≥2 fold change and FDR of &amp;lt;5%. Different gene ontology (GO) categories were represented prominently in transcriptome data at these stages (e.g. days 4: cell cycle, chromosome, DNA metabolic process and replication and on day 11: immune response; lipid metabolic process and complement activation). Based on bioinformatic analyses, select genes expression in day 4 and 11 CL was validated with quantitative real-time PCR. Cell specific expression was also determined in enriched luteal endothelial and steroidogenic cells. Genes related to the angiogenic process such as &lt;i&gt;NOS3&lt;/i&gt;, which maintains dilated vessels and &lt;i&gt;MMP9&lt;/i&gt;, matrix degrading enzyme, were higher on day 4. Importantly, our data suggests day 11 CL acquire mechanisms to prevent blood vessel sprouting and promote their maturation by expressing &lt;i&gt;NOTCH4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JAG1&lt;/i&gt;, greatly enriched in luteal endothelial cells. Another endothelial specific gene, &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt;, was identified here in the CL for the first time. &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt; is an adhesion molecule enabling lymphocyte migration, its higher levels at mid cycle are expected to support the transmigration of immune cells into the CL at this stage. Together with steroidogenic genes, most of the genes regulating de-novo cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (e.g &lt;i&gt;HMGCS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HMGCR&lt;/i&gt;) and cholesterol uptake from plasma (&lt;i&gt;LDLR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) were upregulated in the mature CL. These findings provide new insight of the processes involved in CL maturation including blood vessel growth and stabilization, leucocyte transmigration as well as progesterone synthesis as the CL matures.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194456</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194456</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Genomic profiling of bovine corpus luteum maturation</title><fingerprint>98bfe610</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sigal Kfir, Raghavendra Basavaraja, Noa Wigoda, Shifra Ben-Dor, Irit Orr, Rina Meidan&lt;/p&gt;

These findings provide new insight of the processes involved in CL maturation including blood vessel growth and stabilization, leucocyte transmigration as well as progesterone synthesis as the CL matures.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194456</canonicalUrl><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad281c:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3211.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Stephen J.

Unrecognized endobronchial intubation frequently occurs after emergency intubation. However, no study has evaluated the effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We compared the hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during one-lung ventilation with those during conventional two-lung ventilation in a pig model of CPR, to determine the effect of the former on ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). However, no difference in ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was detected between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and oxygen saturation (SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) differed among the three types of ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, respectively). The post hoc analyses revealed a higher PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, lower PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and lower SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung or left-lung ventilation. However, the levels of these blood gases did not differ between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. In a pig model of CPR, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was significantly lower during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung ventilation.

Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease. We conducted a scoping review of child growth studies in which length/height, weight or body mass index (BMI) was measured at ≥ 2 time points. From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., ‘weight gain’) and a ‘content signature’, a numeric code that summarized the metric’s conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child’s change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels. In conclusion, the numerous distinct growth metrics and the lack of specificity in the application of metric labels challenge the integration of data and inferences from studies investigating the determinants or consequences of variations in childhood growth.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194565</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194565</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Metrics of early childhood growth in recent epidemiological research: A scoping review</title><fingerprint>34cbd772</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Leung, Nandita Perumal, Elnathan Mesfin, Aditi Krishna, Seungmi Yang, William Johnson, Diego G.

The centrifuge is among the oldest and most widely used pieces of laboratory equipment, with significant applications that include clinical diagnostics and biomedical research. A major limitation of laboratory centrifuges is their “black box” nature, limiting sample observation to before and after centrifugation. Thus, optimized protocols require significant trial and error, while unoptimized protocols waste time by centrifuging longer than necessary or material due to incomplete sedimentation. Here, we developed an instrumented centrifuge tube receptacle compatible with several commercial benchtop centrifuges that can provide real-time sample analysis during centrifugation. We demonstrated the system by monitoring cell separations during centrifugation for different spin speeds, concentrations, buffers, cell types, and temperatures. We show that the collected data are valuable for analytical purposes (e.g. quality control), or as feedback to the user or the instrument. For the latter, we verified an adaptation where complete sedimentation turned off the centrifuge and notified the user by a text message. Our system adds new functionality to existing laboratory centrifuges, saving users time and providing useful feedback. This add-on potentially enables new analytical applications for an instrument that has remained largely unchanged for decades.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195907</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195907</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>A ‘smart’ tube holder enables real-time sample monitoring in a standard lab centrifuge</title><fingerprint>fddcce0b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tony Hoang, Nicholas Moskwa, Ken Halvorsen&lt;/p&gt;

The present study evaluated auditory sensitivity to spectral modulation by determining the modulation depth required to detect modulation phase reversal. This approach may be preferable to spectral modulation detection with a spectrally flat standard, since listeners appear unable to perform the task based on the detection of temporal modulation. While phase reversal thresholds are often evaluated by holding modulation depth constant and adjusting modulation rate, holding rate constant and adjusting modulation depth supports rate-specific assessment of modulation processing. Stimuli were pink noise samples, filtered into seven octave-wide bands (0.125–8 kHz) and spectrally modulated in dB. Experiment 1 measured performance as a function of modulation depth to determine appropriate units for adaptive threshold estimation. Experiment 2 compared thresholds in dB for modulation detection with a flat standard and modulation phase reversal; results supported the idea that temporal cues were available at high rates for the former but not the latter. Experiment 3 evaluated spectral modulation phase reversal thresholds for modulation that was restricted to either one or two neighboring bands. Flanking bands of unmodulated noise had a larger detrimental effect on one-band than two-band targets. Thresholds for high-rate modulation improved with increasing carrier frequency up to 2 kHz, whereas low-rate modulation appeared more consistent across frequency, particularly in the two-band condition. Experiment 4 measured spectral weights for spectral modulation phase reversal detection and found higher weights for bands in the spectral center of the stimulus than for the lowest (0.125 kHz) or highest (8 kHz) band. Experiment 5 compared performance for highly practiced and relatively naïve listeners, and found weak evidence of a larger practice effect at high than low spectral modulation rates. These results provide preliminary data for a task that may provide a better estimate of sensitivity to spectral modulation than spectral modulation detection with a flat standard.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195686</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195686</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Auditory sensitivity to spectral modulation phase reversal as a function of modulation depth</title><fingerprint>6e45d9a8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emily Buss, John Grose&lt;/p&gt;

These results provide preliminary data for a task that may provide a better estimate of sensitivity to spectral modulation than spectral modulation detection with a flat standard.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195686</canonicalUrl><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d74d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.34</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Sean Khozin</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.34</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/Wuto617TZlg/nrd.2018.34</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.34</link><published>1522998000000</published><title>INFORMED: an incubator at the US FDA for driving innovations in data science and agile technology</title><fingerprint>4ad2dbbd</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INFORMED: an incubator at the US FDA for driving innovations in data science and agile technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INFORMED: an incubator at the US FDA for driving innovations in data science and agile technology, Published online: 06 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.34&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Information Exchange and Data Transformation (INFORMED), a multidisciplinary initiative anchored in the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence, is a decentralized science and technology incubator designed to harness the power of big data and advanced analytics to improve disease outcomes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/Wuto617TZlg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_162997d7dfd:aa203c1:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INFORMED: an incubator at the US FDA for driving innovations in data science and agile technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INFORMED: an incubator at the US FDA for driving innovations in data science and agile technology, Published online: 06 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.34&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Information Exchange and Data Transformation (INFORMED), a multidisciplinary initiative anchored in the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence, is a decentralized science and technology incubator designed to harness the power of big data and advanced analytics to improve disease outcomes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/Wuto617TZlg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1522993561085</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2942.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>George J.

In contrast, the evolution of the ventricular Purkinje network is strongly associated with high heart rates and endothermy.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32120</link><published>1521676800000</published><title>Specialized impulse conduction pathway in the alligator heart</title><fingerprint>f5ee2c95</fingerprint><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item><item>Genomics and Evolutionary Biology</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1624dc4961b:3e8a458:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521723151899</crawled><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32120</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03584-3</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Cheng Sun</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oncofetal gene &lt;i&gt;SALL4&lt;/i&gt; reactivation by hepatitis B virus counteracts miR-200c in PD-L1-induced T cell exhaustion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oncofetal gene &amp;lt;i&gt;SALL4&amp;lt;/i&gt; reactivation by hepatitis B virus counteracts miR-200c in PD-L1-induced T cell exhaustion, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03584-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03584-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Blocking PD-1 function on T cells is thought to be a viable strategy to prevent virus-induced or tumor-induced T cell exhaustion.

One of the more fundamental health policy questions is the relationship between health care quality and spending. A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46). Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195222</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195222</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Association between quality domains and health care spending across physician networks</title><fingerprint>13e993e5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Farah Rahman, Jun Guan, Richard H.

For tetramer, a highly symmetrical S4 structure was found as the most stable form in good accordance with experimentally determined tetramer unit in the formaldehyde crystal. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</link><published>1522649592000</published><title>Quantum chemical exploration of formaldehyde clusters (H2CO)n (n = 2–4)</title><fingerprint>e8ab9ef6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162956fcc6f:a3d99f3:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522925554799</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03423-x</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>Davide Castelvecchi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Grand unifying theory of maths’ nets Abel Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Grand unifying theory of maths’ nets Abel Prize, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03423-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03423-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Robert Langlands’ ideas unearthed connections within mathematics that have helped to solve centuries-old problems and aided researchers in disparate fields.</description><engagement>909</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03423-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03423-x</link><published>1521529200000</published><title>‘Grand unifying theory of maths’ nets Abel Prize</title><fingerprint>68c34b6b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Grand unifying theory of maths’ nets Abel Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Grand unifying theory of maths’ nets Abel Prize, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03423-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03423-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Robert Langlands’ ideas unearthed connections within mathematics that have helped to solve centuries-old problems and aided researchers in disparate fields.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16243599654:2deab17:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03423-x/d41586-018-03423-x_15548168.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1521548367444</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3350.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Alice E.

Based on extensive Langevin Dynamics simulations we investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of magnetic rods with a peapod-like morphology, i.e, rods consisting of aligned single dipolar beads. Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found. For the same density, the system exhibits different aggregation states for different misalignment. We also study the stability of the percolated structures with respect to temperature, which is found to be affected by the microstructure of the assembly of rods.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195552</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195552</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Self-assembly and clustering of magnetic peapod-like rods with tunable directional interaction</title><fingerprint>1b624c1d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge L.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies has investigated majority influence in nonhuman animals. However, due to both terminological and methodological issues, evidence for conformity in nonhuman animals is scarce and controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that wild birds, wild monkeys, and fish show conformity, that is, forgoing personal information in order to copy the majority. By contrast, chimpanzees seem to lack this tendency. The present study is the first to examine whether dogs (&lt;i&gt;Canis familiaris)&lt;/i&gt; show conformity. Specifically, we tested whether dogs conform to a majority of conspecifics rather than stick to what they have previously learned. After dogs had acquired a behavioral preference via training (i.e., shaping), they were confronted with counter-preferential behavior of either no, one or three conspecifics. Traditional frequentist analyses show that the dogs’ behavior did not differ significantly between the three conditions. Complementary Bayesian analyses suggest that our data provide moderate evidence for the null hypothesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that dogs stick to what they have learned rather than conform to the counter-preferential behavior of others. We discuss the possible statistical and methodological limitations of this finding. Furthermore, we take a functional perspective on conformity and discuss under which circumstances dogs might show conformity after all.</description><engagement>33</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194808</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194808</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Dogs (&amp;lt;i&gt;Canis familiaris&amp;lt;/i&gt;) stick to what they have learned rather than conform to their conspecifics’ behavior</title><fingerprint>eb50a6a4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Markus Germar, Amira Sultan, Juliane Kaminski, Andreas Mojzisch&lt;/p&gt;

Bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) is one experimental model of vascular dementia thought to preferentially impact brain white matter. Indeed, few studies report hippocampal and cortical pathology prior to 30 days post-stenosis; though it is unclear whether those studies examined regions outside the white matter. Since changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability precede more overt brain pathology in various diseases, we hypothesized that changes within the BBB and/or BBB-associated extracellular matrix (ECM) could occur earlier after BCAS in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum and be a precursor of longer term pathology. Here, C57Bl/6 mice underwent BCAS or sham surgeries and changes in the BBB and ECM were analyzed by collagen IV (vascular basement membrane component), α5 integrin (marker of endothelial activation), claudin-5 and occludin (tight junction proteins), Evans blue (permeability marker), Ki-67 (cell proliferation marker), and GFAP and CD11b (glial cell markers) immunohistochemistry after 14 days. Significant changes in markers of cerebrovascular integrity and glial activation were detected, not only in the striatum, but also in the hippocampus and cortex. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that changes in the BBB/ECM occur shortly after BCAS and within multiple brain regions and suggests such changes might underlie the gradual development of BCAS non-white matter pathology.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195765</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195765</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Bilateral carotid artery stenosis causes unexpected early changes in brain extracellular matrix and blood-brain barrier integrity in mice</title><fingerprint>a5fc01f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jill M.

Background/Objectives &lt;p&gt;Abdominal obesity (AO) is associated with elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases; however, this association is less clear for non-obese people. We estimated the association of AO and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and disease in non-obese adult individuals from Chile.&lt;/p&gt; Subjects/Methods &lt;p&gt;5248 adults (15 years of age or older) of both sexes from the Chilean National Health Survey (October 2009 –September 2010, response rate 85%.) were included. Information on myocardial infarction and stroke was self-reported. BMI, waist circumference (WC), arterial pressure, plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels were measured. Predictive accuracy of WC was evaluated by area under curve of receiver operating characteristic analysis and cut off points were established by Youden Index. Relationship between AO and CVRF was analyzed by Chi-squared tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Normal weight/overweight/obesity were present in 34.4%/45.2%/18.1% of men and 33.4%/33.6%/27.5% of women. Predictive accuracy of WC to identify at least one CVRF was 0.70/0.67 and optimal cutoff points for WC in non-obese subjects were 91/83 cm in men/women, respectively. AO was present in 98.2%/99.1% of obese, 70.5%/77.4% of overweight and 12.4%/16.4% of normal weight men/women. AO was associated with increased frequency of CVRF in overweight men (6/8 and stroke) and women (4/8) and higher frequency in normal weight men (8/8 and myocardial infarction/stroke) and women (6/8 and myocardial infarction).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;WC cutoff points calculated for non-obese chilean population discriminate more differences in CVRF in normal weight woman. AO significantly increases the frequency of CVRF and diseases in overweight and especially normal weight individuals. WC can be used as a low cost, feasible and reproducible predictor for CVRF in non-obese individuals in most clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194644</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194644</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Abdominal obesity is a common finding in normal and overweight subjects of Chile and is associated with increased frequency of cardiometabolic risk factors</title><fingerprint>744df93c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Beatriz Villanueva, Antonio Arteaga, Alberto Maiz, Víctor A.

Ageing is associated with grey matter atrophy and changes in task-related neural activations. This study investigated the effects of age and education on neural activation during a spatial working memory task in 189 participants aged between 20–80 years old, whilst controlling for grey matter density. Age was related to linear decreases in neural activation in task activated areas, and this effect was no longer significant when adjusting for education or accuracy. Age was also related to cubic increases in neural activation in non-task related areas, such as the temporal gyrus, cuneus and cerebellum when adjusting for accuracy and education. These findings support previous lifespan datasets indicating linear age-related decreases in task activation, but non-linear increases in non-task related areas during episodic memory tasks. The findings also support past studies indicating education offers a form of cognitive reserve through providing a form of neural compensation and highlights the need to consider education in ageing studies.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194878</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194878</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Working memory, age and education: A lifespan fMRI study</title><fingerprint>8b6fabff</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jo A.

The findings also support past studies indicating education offers a form of cognitive reserve through providing a form of neural compensation and highlights the need to consider education in ageing studies.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194878</canonicalUrl><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f16:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03803-3</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More than one-third of graduate students report being depressed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one-third of graduate students report being depressed, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03803-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03803-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rates of anxiety and depression among PhD and master’s students exceed those in general public.</description><engagement>1261</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03803-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03803-3</link><published>1522047600000</published><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>b03ff614</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More than one-third of graduate students report being depressed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one-third of graduate students report being depressed, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03803-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03803-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rates of anxiety and depression among PhD and master’s students exceed those in general public.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16261789223:582c477:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03803-3/d41586-018-03803-3_15559678.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1522053714467</crawled><title>More than one-third of graduate students report being depressed</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196139</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196139</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196139</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Correction: Psychometric properties of the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) and its relationship with life-stress, anxiety and depression in a Hispanic Latin-American community sample</title><fingerprint>6956b536</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196139</canonicalUrl><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7af2:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288779v3?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><author><name>He, J.</name></author><description>Bulk tumor tissues comprise intermixed populations of neoplastic cells and multiple stromal cell lineages.

&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a protozoon parasite that causes congenital toxoplasmosis, as well as other serious clinical presentations, in immune compromised humans. Analyses of the prevalence and genotyping of strains from the definitive host and intermediate hosts will help to understanding the circulation of the different strains and elucidating the role of the genotype(s) in human toxoplasmosis. Turkey has a specific geographic location bridging Africa, Europe, and Asia. We hypothesized that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains may have been transferred to Turkey from these continents via migratory birds or vice versa. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in wild birds of prey of İzmir and Manisa provinces as well as genetically characterize &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains from these wild birds to show the relation between bird strains and neighboring stray cats as well as human strains previously isolated in Turkey. Tissues obtained from 48 wild birds were investigated for the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA and then bioassayed in mouse. Isolated strains were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers. The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA was found to be 89.6% (n: 43/48) in wild birds. Out of 43 positive samples, a total of 14 strains were genotyped by 15 microsatellite markers. Among them, eight were type II, three were type III and three were mixture of genotypes (two type II/II and one was II/III). These are the first data that showed the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; and types II and III genotypes in wild birds of Turkey. Moreover, Africa 1 was not detected. In addition, cluster analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains within type II and III lineage have close relation with strains previously isolated from stray cats in İzmir. Further studies are required to isolate more strains from human cases, other intermediate hosts, and water sources to reveal this relation.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196159</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196159</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Prevalence of toxoplasmosis and genetic characterization of &amp;lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&amp;lt;/i&gt; strains isolated in wild birds of prey and their relation with previously isolated strains from Turkey</title><fingerprint>cb4ccfc2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammet Karakavuk, Duygu Aldemir, Aurélien Mercier, Esra Atalay Şahar, Hüseyin Can, Jean-Benjamin Murat, Ömer Döndüren, Şengül Can, Hüseyin Gökhan Özdemir, Aysu Değirmenci Döşkaya, Bayram Pektaş, Marie-Laure Dardé, Adnan Yüksel Gürüz, Mert Döşkaya&lt;/p&gt;

Isolated strains were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers. The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA was found to be 89.6% (n: 43/48) in wild birds. Out of 43 positive samples, a total of 14 strains were genotyped by 15 microsatellite markers. Among them, eight were type II, three were type III and three were mixture of genotypes (two type II/II and one was II/III). These are the first data that showed the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; and types II and III genotypes in wild birds of Turkey. Moreover, Africa 1 was not detected. In addition, cluster analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains within type II and III lineage have close relation with strains previously isolated from stray cats in İzmir. Further studies are required to isolate more strains from human cases, other intermediate hosts, and water sources to reveal this relation.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196159</canonicalUrl><updated>1524085200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe37:34f43e70</id><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194985</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Jinsung Yoon</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinsung Yoon, William R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Risk prediction is crucial in many areas of medical practice, such as cardiac transplantation, but existing clinical risk-scoring methods have suboptimal performance. We develop a novel risk prediction algorithm and test its performance on the database of all patients who were registered for cardiac transplantation in the United States during 1985-2015.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We develop a new, interpretable, methodology (ToPs: Trees of Predictors) built on the principle that specific predictive (survival) models should be used for specific clusters within the patient population. ToPs &lt;i&gt;discovers&lt;/i&gt; these specific clusters and the specific predictive model that performs best for each cluster. In comparison with existing clinical risk scoring methods and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, our method provides significant improvements in survival predictions, both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. For instance: in terms of 3-month survival post-transplantation, our method achieves AUC of 0.660; the best clinical risk scoring method (RSS) achieves 0.587. In terms of 3-year survival/mortality predictions post-transplantation (in comparison to RSS), holding specificity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts survival for 2,442 (14.0%) more patients (of 17,441 who actually survived); holding sensitivity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts mortality for 694 (13.0%) more patients (of 5,339 who did not survive). ToPs achieves similar improvements for other time horizons and for predictions pre-transplantation. ToPs discovers the most relevant features (covariates), uses available features to best advantage, and can adapt to changes in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We show that, in comparison with existing clinical risk-scoring methods and other machine learning methods, ToPs significantly improves survival predictions both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. ToPs provides a more accurate, personalized approach to survival prediction that can benefit patients, clinicians, and policymakers in making clinical decisions and setting clinical policy. Because survival prediction is widely used in clinical decision-making across diseases and clinical specialties, the implications of our methods are far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194985</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194985</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>Personalized survival predictions via Trees of Predictors: An application to cardiac transplantation</title><fingerprint>ed2de656</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinsung Yoon, William R.

Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters inside a living cell will lead to major advances in our understanding of biology and complex diseases, such as cancer. It also enables the development of new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Progress in nanofabrication and wireless communication has opened up the potential of making a wireless chip small enough that it can be wholly inserted into a living cell. To investigate how such chips could be internalized into various types of living single cells and how this process might affect cells’ physiology, we designed and fabricated a series of multilayered micron-scale tag structures with different sizes as potential RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cell trackers. While the present structures are test structures that do not resonate, the tags that do resonate have similar structure from device fabrication, material properties, and device size point of view. The structures are in four different sizes, the largest with the lateral dimension of 9 μm × 21 μm. The thickness for these structures is kept constant at 1.5 μm. We demonstrate successful delivery of our fabricated chips into various types of living cells, such as melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and healthy/normal fibroblast skin cells. To our surprise, we observed a remarkable internalization rate difference between each cell type; the uptake rate was faster for more aggressive cancer cells than the normal/healthy cells. Cell viability before and after tag cellular internalization and persistence of the internalized tags have also been recorded over the course of five days of incubation. These results establish the foundations of the possibility of long term, wireless, intracellular physiological signal monitoring.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194712</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194712</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>Internalization of subcellular-scale microfabricated chips by healthy and cancer cells</title><fingerprint>34706f2b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kokab B.

Vocal development is usually studied from the perspective of neuroscience. In this issue, Zhang and Ghazanfar propose a way in which body growth might condition the process. They study the vocalizations of marmoset infants with a wide range of techniques that include computational models and experiments that mimic growth reversal. Their results suggest that the qualitative changes that occur during development are rooted in the nonlinear interaction between the nervous system and the biomechanics involved in respiration. This work illustrates how an integrative approach enriches our understanding of behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zvNFkUWyj-M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1521752400000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1624ed044f7:554aee:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel B.

Background &lt;p&gt;The need to evaluate the human health safety of fishery resources remain urgent in the mist of the ever-increasing fear of heavy metal toxicity from the consumption of Ghana’s fisheries resource, as a consequence of pollution from several anthropogenic activities including artisanal gold mining. Nevertheless, the bigeye grunt (&lt;i&gt;Brachydeuterus auritus&lt;/i&gt;) and Bagrid catfish (&lt;i&gt;Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt;) remain commercially valuable fish species in West Africa and continue to attract high patronage.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Forty-five specimens each of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; collected from the Weija Dam and the Tema Fishing Habour in Ghana, between June and September 2016, were analysed for seven heavy metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Lead and Cadmium were below detection in all samples while Cu was not detected in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Levels of the remaining metals (mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) were below FAO/WHO maximum permissible limits in fish and occurred in the rank order Se (3.5) &gt; Zn (2.34) &gt; Cu (0.59) &gt; As (0.37) &gt; Hg (0.19) in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Se (2.97) &gt; Zn (2.28) &gt; Hg (0.31) &gt; As (0.21) in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Only As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; recorded Estimated Weekly Intake (EWI) greater than FAO/WHO Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI). Also, As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Hg in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; had Targeted Hazard Quotient (THQ) greater than 1 for individuals consuming the fishes on daily basis and therefore, raising concerns. However, for both species of fish, cancer risk of As was 1 in 10,000,000,000 and modified Health Benefits values of Se (HBV&lt;sub&gt;Se&lt;/sub&gt;) were positive indicating the health risks that might accompany Hg exposure would be negated. Since toxicity depends on the concentration and quantity of a pollutant consumed, safe maximum consumption rate of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; based on As concentrations was 0.21 mg per day and that of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; was 0.058 mg per day for Hg. With an average of 0.227 kg fish per meal of an adult human, these translated into not more than 24 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and nine (9) &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; meals in a month but because fish is consumed at 0.0685 kg per person per day in Ghana, these values respectively translates to 93 and 30 safe days of consumption per month.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;At the rate of 0.0685 kg fish per person per day that fish is consumed in Ghana, the consumption of the two species of fish in Ghana would essentially be of little or no consequence to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194682</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194682</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Risk of heavy metal ingestion from the consumption of two commercially valuable species of fish from the fresh and coastal waters of Ghana</title><fingerprint>9f718895</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Gbogbo, Anna Arthur-Yartel, Josephine A.

We have previously investigated the physiological role of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on endochondral bone growth, mainly with mutant mouse models deficient in CNP, and reported that CNP is indispensable for physiological endochondral bone growth in mice. However, the survival rate of CNP knockout (KO) mice fell to as low as about 70% until 10 weeks after birth, and we could not sufficiently analyze the phenotype at the adult stage. Herein, we generated CNP KO rats by using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated genome editing technology. We established two lines of mutant rats completely deficient in CNP (CNP KO rats) that exhibited a phenotype identical to that observed in mice deficient in CNP, namely, a short stature with severely impaired endochondral bone growth. Histological analysis revealed that the width of the growth plate, especially that of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, was markedly lower and the proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes tended to be reduced in CNP KO rats. Notably, CNP KO rats did not have malocclusions and survived for over one year after birth. At 33 weeks of age, CNP KO rats persisted significantly shorter than wild-type rats, with closed growth plates of the femur in all samples, which were not observed in wild-type rats. Histologically, CNP deficiency affected only bones among all body tissues studied. Thus, CNP KO rats survive over one year, and exhibit a deficit in endochondral bone growth and growth retardation throughout life.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194812</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194812</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Rats deficient C-type natriuretic peptide suffer from impaired skeletal growth without early death</title><fingerprint>f8b07d22</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Toshihito Fujii, Keisho Hirota, Akihiro Yasoda, Akiko Takizawa, Naomi Morozumi, Ryuichi Nakamura, Takafumi Yotsumoto, Eri Kondo, Yui Yamashita, Yoriko Sakane, Yugo Kanai, Yohei Ueda, Ichiro Yamauchi, Shigeki Yamanaka, Kazumasa Nakao, Koichiro Kuwahara, Toshimasa Jindo, Mayumi Furuya, Tomoji Mashimo, Nobuya Inagaki, Tadao Serikawa, Kazuwa Nakao&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To establish reference values for hand grip strength (HGS) in a healthy Korean population and to identify the dependent anthropometric variables that affect HGS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2014 to 2015, we analyzed the HGS data of 7,969 South Koreans. Individuals with specific chronic diseases and who reported poor subjective health status were excluded to ensure a healthy population sample. Means with standard deviations (SDs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each 5-year interval starting from 10 years of age. To determine the relationship between HGS and anthropometric variables, we performed correlation analyses between HGS and height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Additionally, based on these findings, the cut-off value for low HGS was presented by deriving -2SD values of healthy young adults as recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean age and BMI of men and women were 38.3 and 38.2 years and 23.8 and 22.4 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Mean HGS of the dominant hand in men and women was 39.5 and 24.2 kg, respectively. The peak in HGS was at 35–39 years of age, after which HGS decreased in both sexes. HGS was significantly correlated with height, weight, and BMI. The cut-off values for weak HGS were &amp;lt; 28.9 and &amp;lt; 16.8 kg in men and women, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results provide useful reference values to assess HGS in patients who undergo hand surgery or who have various diseases that affect HGS.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To establish reference values for hand grip strength (HGS) in a healthy Korean population and to identify the dependent anthropometric variables that affect HGS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2014 to 2015, we analyzed the HGS data of 7,969 South Koreans.

Ultra-precision face turning of Al6061 mirrors using single point diamond turning (SPDT) was undertaken to investigate the correlation between the surface roughness and reflectance. By reducing the feed rate, the optimal feed rate when the chip formation became unstable was studied. Most importantly, the impact on the roughness and reflectance was examined when the chip formation ceased to be continuous. It was determined that for a feed rate below 3 mm/min, the surface roughness always improved as the feed rate decreased, at the cost of a reduction of the normalized reflectance. The reduction of reflectance was determined to be the result of the lower material removal rates that led to a discontinuous chip formation.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195083</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195083</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Al6061 surface roughness and optical reflectance when machined by single point diamond turning at a low feed rate</title><fingerprint>3d5da0e0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by L.

Concordance between results was assessed by the Kappa index, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman graphs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From an initial population of 179 COPD patients, 100 completed the study (mean age 67.8 years, 83% men, 35% active smokers, FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at clinical stability 40.3%). Forty-nine patients could not complete the study because they did not reach clinical stability. In three patients with obstructive spirometry during admission, the results were normal at follow-up.

Background &lt;p&gt;Unstable conditions of the craniocervical junction such as atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) or atlanto-axial instability (AAI) are severe injuries with a high risk of tetraplegia or death. Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown.The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system.In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9° of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement. In case of unstable craniocervical junction, this leads to a dural sac compression and thus to possible damage to the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195215</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195215</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Motion and dural sac compression in the upper cervical spine during the application of a cervical collar in case of unstable craniocervical junction—A study in two new cadaveric trauma models</title><fingerprint>4ad99bdb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shiyao Liao, Niko R.

Individuals with low levels of education systematically have worse health than those with medium or high levels of education. Yet there are few examples of attempts to summarize the evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions targeting health-related behavior among individuals with low education levels, and a large part of the literature is descriptive rather than analytical. A rapid review was carried out to examine the impact of such interventions. Special attention was given to the relative impact of the interventions among individuals with low education levels and their potential to reduce health inequality. Of 1,365 articles initially identified, only 31 were deemed relevant for the review, and of those, nine met the inclusion and quality criteria. The comparability of included studies was limited due to differences in study design, sample characteristics, and definitions of exposure and outcome variables. Therefore, instead of performing a formal meta-analysis, an overall assessment of the available evidence was made and summarized into some general conclusions. We found no support for the notion that the methods used to reduce smoking decrease inequalities in health between educational groups. Evidence was also limited for decreasing inequality through interventions regarding dietary intake, physical activity and mental health. Only one study was found using an intervention designed to decrease socioeconomic inequalities by increasing the use of breast cancer screening. Thus, we concluded that there is a lack of support regarding this type of intervention as well. Therefore, the main conclusion is that solid evidence is lacking for interventions aimed at individual determinants of health and that more research is needed to fill this gap in knowledge.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195774</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195774</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Reducing health inequalities with interventions targeting behavioral factors among individuals with low levels of education - A rapid review</title><fingerprint>2962fae8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Vilhelmsson, Per-Olof Östergren&lt;/p&gt;

Our work provides a general framework for newly bootstrapping single cell analysis from existing data sets.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/289223</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162676049be:608969d:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522152786366</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/163-b?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/163-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/163-b?rss=1</link><published>1523554635000</published><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>5eac636a</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/163.2.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fece9d:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><title>SciComm speaks</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25163?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25163?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25163?af=R</link><published>1522118890699</published><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>b0da14ed</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162655b14cb:6ce08:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522118890699</crawled></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194597</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Ju-Eun Song</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ju-Eun Song, Jeong-Ah Ahn, Sun-Kyoung Lee, Eun Ha Roh&lt;/p&gt;
The purpose of this study was to explore the factors influencing low birth rate among married women using the National Survey data in Korea. We compared the different influences on women’s first and subsequent childbirths. This study was a secondary analysis using the “National Survey on Fertility and Family Health and Welfare”, which was a nationally representative survey conducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. We analyzed the data of 3,482 married women (aged between 19 and 39 years) using SPSS 20.0 program for descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way ANOVA, and binary and ordinal logistic regression models. The factors influencing women’s first childbirth included perceptions about the value of marriage and children and their education level. The factors influencing their subsequent childbirths included multifaceted variables of maternal age during the first childbirth, residential area, religion, monthly household income, perceptions about the value of marriage and children, and social media. It is necessary to improve women’s awareness and positive perceptions about marriage and children in order to increase the birth rate in Korea. Moreover, consistently providing financial and political support for maternal and childcare concerns and using social media to foster more positive attitudes toward having children may enhance birth rates in the future.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194597</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194597</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Factors related to low birth rate among married women in Korea</title><fingerprint>ba525c0c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ju-Eun Song, Jeong-Ah Ahn, Sun-Kyoung Lee, Eun Ha Roh&lt;/p&gt;

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects besides muscle also the brain, resulting in memory and behavioral problems. The consequences of dystrophinopathy on gross macroscopic alterations are unclear. To elucidate the effect of full-length dystrophin expression on brain morphology, we used high-resolution post-mortem MRI in mouse models that either express 0% (&lt;i&gt;mdx&lt;/i&gt;), 100% (BL10) or a low amount of full-length dystrophin (&lt;i&gt;mdx&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Xist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Δhs&lt;/sup&gt;). While absence or low amounts of full-length dystrophin did not significantly affect whole brain volume and skull morphology, we found differences in volume of individual brain structures. The results are in line with observations in humans, where whole brain volume was found to be reduced only in patients lacking both full-length dystrophin and the shorter isoform Dp140.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194636</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194636</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>Influence of full-length dystrophin on brain volumes in mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title><fingerprint>5b78a78f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bauke Kogelman, Artem Khmelinskii, Ingrid Verhaart, Laura van Vliet, Diewertje I.

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry. The larger amplitude significantly increased bone formation (Fractional bone volume: 19.4% vs. 5.2%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; trabecular thickness: 0.1 mm vs. 0.06 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; mean spicule height: 2.6 mm vs. 1.1 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) however, no endochondral ossification occurred. The elimination of shear movement, unimpaired neovascularization as well as the tensile strain stimuli during the distraction phase suppressing chondrogenic differentiation may all contribute to the absence of cartilage. In clinical application of distraction osteogenesis, moderate axial interfragmentary movement augments intramembranous ossification provided shear strain is minimized.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195466</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195466</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Intramembranous bone formation after callus distraction is augmented by increasing axial compressive strain</title><fingerprint>53f003d2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Julian Schuelke, Nicholaus Meyers, Sandra Reitmaier, Svenja Klose, Anita Ignatius, Lutz Claes&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;This study explored spatial-temporal variation in diagnoses of gonorrhoea to identify and quantify endemic areas and clusters in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes of partner notification (PN) across England, UK.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Endemic areas and clusters were identified using a two-stage analysis with Kulldorff’s scan statistics (SaTScan).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2,571,838 tests, 53,547 diagnoses were gonorrhoea positive (positivity = 2.08%). The proportion of diagnoses in heterosexual males was 1.5 times that in heterosexual females. Among index cases, men who have sex with men (MSM) were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhoea than heterosexual males (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and deprivation rank, 4 endemic areas were identified including 11,047 diagnoses, 86% of which occurred in London. 33 clusters included 17,629 diagnoses (34% of total diagnoses in 2012 and 2013) and spanned 21 locations, some of which were dominated by heterosexually acquired infection, whilst others were MSM focused. Of the 53,547 diagnoses, 14.5% (7,775) were the result of PN. The proportion of patients who attended services as a result of PN varied from 0% to 61% within different age, gender and sexual orientation cohorts. A third of tests resulting from PN were positive for gonorrhoea. 25% of Local Authorities (n = 81, 95% CI: 20.2, 29.5) had a higher than expected proportion for female PN diagnoses as compared to 16% for males (n = 52, 95% CI: 12.0, 19.9).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The English gonorrhoea epidemic is characterised by spatial-temporal variation. PN success varied between endemic areas and clusters. Greater emphasis should be placed on the role of PN in the control of gonorrhoea to reduce the risk of onward transmission, re-infection, and complications of infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195178</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195178</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Spatial clusters of gonorrhoea in England with particular reference to the outcome of partner notification: 2012 and 2013</title><fingerprint>86d9427a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Allen O’Brien, Ellie Sherrard-Smith, Bersabeh Sile, Charlotte Watts, Ian Simms&lt;/p&gt;

Recent advances in culture-free microbiological techniques bring new understanding of the role of intestinal microbiota in heath and performance. Intestinal microbial communities in chickens assume a near-stable state within the week which leaves a very small window for permanent microbiota remodelling. It is the first colonisers that determine the fate of microbial community in humans and birds alike, and after the microbiota has matured there are very small odds for permanent modification as stable community resists change. In this study we inoculated broiler chicks immediately post hatch, with 3 species of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA and pheS genes as &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;reuteri&lt;/i&gt;. The strains were isolated from the gut of healthy chickens as reproducibly persistent &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; strains among multiple flocks. Birds inoculated with the probiotic mix reached significantly higher weight by 28 days of age. Although each strain was able to colonise when administered alone, administering the probiotic mix at-hatch resulted in colonisation by only &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt;. High initial abundance of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt; was slowly reducing, however, the effects of at-hatch administration of the &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; mix on modifying microbiota development and structure remained persistent.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of retrospective studies that investigated the association of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with the overall survival (OS) of patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A detailed literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed databases up to August 28, 2017, for related research publications written in English. We extracted the data from these studies and combined the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the correlation between CRP levels and OS in patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five studies with a total of 816 participants from several countries were enrolled in this current meta-analysis. In a pooled analysis of all the publications, increased serum CRP levels had an adverse prognostic effect on the overall survival of patients with bone neoplasms. However, the combined data showed no significant relationship between the level of CRP and OS in Asian patients (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.86–3.49; P = 0.125). Similar trends were observed in patients with bone neoplasms when stratified by ethnicity, histology, metastasis and study sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The results of this meta-analysis suggest that increased CRP expression indicates a poorer prognosis in patients with bone neoplasms.

It is an absolute requirement that every time you write about graphene that you mention that the breakthrough in its isolation came from the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0218/230218-graphene-sticky-tape&quot;&gt;adhesive tape&lt;/a&gt;, a low-tech insight at Manchester that led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/&quot;&gt;Nobel&lt;/a&gt; and kicked off a massive field of research. The latest is that earlier this month, a group at MIT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that if you bring two graphene sheets together, parallel but at a slightly different rotational angle (about 1.1 degrees), that the system becomes a superconductor at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was already unexpected, but the behavior of the material (electron density versus temperature) suggests some real similarities to the copper-oxide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity&quot;&gt;high-temperature superconductors&lt;/a&gt;, and no one saw that coming, either. (Note that “high temperature”, in this field, still means “can be reached in liquid nitrogen as opposed to liquid helium”). Despite a really impressive amount of theoretical and experimental work on the cuprate materials, the full details of their superconductivity are still a matter of debate. It seems to come down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair&quot;&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt; (as with the classic low-temperature superconductors, but the mechanism of the electron pairing is different and in ways that still start arguments. This new graphene systems might be able to shed some light on the various proposals, and you can be certain that a great deal of late-night coffee has been consumed in recent weeks to come up with appropriate experiments along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical value of such an understanding could well be huge (and there is, of course, another near-certain Nobel in physics waiting for whoever puts the field on a firmer basis). To give another recent MIT-related example, new superconductor engineering is at the heart of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-newly-formed-company-launch-novel-approach-fusion-power-0309&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; the university made about fusion power. The belief is that large-bore magnets of such materials, which now appear feasible, could allow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak&quot;&gt;tokamak&lt;/a&gt;-design fusion reactor that is far more compact than any previous attempts. Wrestling with the magnets is one of the biggest problems in designing such machines, because you need extremely strong, extremely homogeneous fields. The high-temperature superconductors were recognized early on as having great possibilities in this area, but the first fusion reactor that used only these materials only became operational in 2014 (a spherical tokamak design at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Tokamak Energy&lt;/a&gt; in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphene-layer materials are still operating at very low temperatures – but considering their electron density, it’s actually a lot higher than it should be. No one is going to be make fusion reactors with twisted-graphite magnets any time soon, but twisted graphite might possibly be the platform that leads us to the magnets that fusion reactors will use.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Chemical News</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1623e80cd73:266183f:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521467051379</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/19/graphene-continues-to-surprise</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00097</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Lei Lei, Kesava Phaneendra Cherukuri, Uria Alcolombri, Diana Meltzer, Dan S.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness which is ultimately fatal, most often due to involvement of the diaphragm. Macrophage infiltration of dystrophic muscles has been strongly linked to muscle damage and fibrosis in DMD. We hypothesized that cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual chemokine receptor (CCR2/CCR5) antagonist currently under clinical evaluation for other diseases, could prevent macrophage accumulation and blunt disease progression in the diaphragms of mdx mice (genetic homologue of DMD). Treatment with CVC (20 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally) or vehicle was initiated in mdx mice at 2 weeks of age (prior to the onset of muscle necrosis) and continued for 4 weeks. Flow cytometry to assess inflammatory cell subsets as well as histological and force generation parameters were determined in mdx diaphragms at the conclusion of the treatment. CVC therapy induced a major (3.9-fold) reduction in total infiltrating macrophages, whereas total numbers of neutrophils and T lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+) were unaffected. No changes in macrophage polarization status (inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory skewing based on iNOS and CD206 expression) were observed. Muscle fiber size and fibrosis were not altered by CVC, whereas a significant reduction in centrally nucleated fibers was found suggesting a decrease in prior necrosis-regeneration cycles. In addition, maximal isometric force production by the diaphragm was increased by CVC therapy. These results suggest that CVC or other chemokine receptor antagonists which reduce pathological macrophage infiltration may have the potential to slow disease progression in DMD.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194421</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194421</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>The dual CCR2/CCR5 chemokine receptor antagonist Cenicriviroc reduces macrophage infiltration and disease severity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Dmd&amp;lt;sup&gt;mdx-4Cv&amp;lt;/sup&gt;) mice</title><fingerprint>84e6d150</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Feng Liang, Christian Giordano, Dong Shang, Qian Li, Basil J.

In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) digitization technique for natural objects, such as insects and plants. The key idea is to combine X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photographs to obtain both complicated 3D shapes and surface textures of target specimens. We measure a specimen by using an X-ray CT device and a digital camera to obtain a CT volumetric image (volume) and multiple photographs. We then reconstruct a 3D model by segmenting the CT volume and generate a texture by projecting the photographs onto the model. To achieve this reconstruction, we introduce a technique for estimating a camera position for each photograph. We also present techniques for merging multiple textures generated from multiple photographs and recovering missing texture areas caused by occlusion. We illustrate the feasibility of our 3D digitization technique by digitizing 3D textured models of insects and flowers. The combination of X-ray CT and a digital camera makes it possible to successfully digitize specimens with complicated 3D structures accurately and allows us to browse both surface colors and internal structures.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195852</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195852</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Digitization of natural objects with micro CT and photographs</title><fingerprint>76ea1616</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ijiri, Hideki Todo, Akira Hirabayashi, Kenji Kohiyama, Yoshinori Dobashi&lt;/p&gt;

Investigating cerebral metabolism &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; at a microscopic level is essential for understanding brain function and its pathological alterations. The intricate signaling and metabolic dynamics between neurons, glia, and microvasculature requires much more detailed understanding to better comprehend the mechanisms governing brain function and its disease-related changes. We recently demonstrated that pharmacologically-induced alterations to different steps of cerebral metabolism can be distinguished utilizing 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of endogenous reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we evaluate the ability of the phasor analysis method to identify these pharmacological metabolic alterations and compare the method’s performance with more conventional nonlinear curve-fitting analysis. Visualization of phasor data, both at the fundamental laser repetition frequency and its second harmonic, enables resolution of pharmacologically-induced alterations to mitochondrial metabolic processes from baseline cerebral metabolism. Compared to our previous classification models based on nonlinear curve-fitting, phasor–based models required fewer parameters and yielded comparable or improved classification accuracy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH and phasor analysis shows utility for detecting metabolic alterations and will lead to a deeper understanding of cerebral energetics and its pathological changes.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194578</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194578</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Phasor analysis of NADH FLIM identifies pharmacological disruptions to mitochondrial metabolic processes in the rodent cerebral cortex</title><fingerprint>7d361b0f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos A.

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children &amp;lt;5years and adults &gt;65 years (2004–2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194823</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194823</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>Increased carriage of non-vaccine serotypes with low invasive disease potential four years after switching to the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in The Netherlands</title><fingerprint>590fb747</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marloes Vissers, Alienke J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disease is characterized by abnormal bone development and early obesity. While the bone aspect of the disease has been thoroughly studied, early obesity affecting approximately 50% of them during childhood has been somewhat neglected. It nevertheless represents a major health problem in these patients, and is associated to life-threatening complications including increasing risk of cardiovascular pathologies. We have thus decided to study obesity in patients and to use the mouse model to evaluate if soluble FGFR3 therapy, an innovative treatment approach for achondroplasia, could also impact the development of this significant complication.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we have first fully characterized the metabolic deregulations in these patients by conducting a longitudinal retrospective study, in children with achondroplasia Anthropometric, densitometric measures as well as several blood parameters were recorded and compared between three age groups ranging from [0–3], [4–8] and [9–18] years old. Our results show unexpected results with the development of an atypical obesity with preferential fat deposition in the abdomen that is remarkably not associated with classical complications of obesity such as diabetes or hypercholosterolemia. Because it is not associated with diabetes, the atypical obesity has not been studied in the past even though it is recognized as a real problem in these patients. These results were validated in a murine model of achondroplasia (&lt;i&gt;Fgfr3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ach/+&lt;/sup&gt;) where similar visceral adiposity was observed. Unexpected alterations in glucose metabolism were highlighted during high-fat diet. Glucose, insulin or lipid levels remained low, without the development of diabetes. Very interestingly, in achondroplasia mice treated with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period (from D3 to D22), the development of these metabolic deregulations was prevented in adult animals (between 4 and 14 weeks of age). The lean-over-fat tissues ratio was restored and glucose metabolism showed normal levels. Treating &lt;i&gt;Fgfr3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ach/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period, prevented the development of these metabolic deregulations in adult animals and restored lean-over-fat tissues ratio as well as glucose metabolism in adult animals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrate that achondroplasia patients develop an atypical obesity with preferential abdominal obesity not associated with classical complications. These results suggest that achondroplasia induces an uncommon metabolism of energy, directly linked to the FGFR3 mutation. These data strongly suggest that this common complication of achondroplasia should be included in the clinical management of patients. In this context, sFGFR3 proved to be a promising treatment for achondroplasia by normalizing the biology at different levels, not only restoring bone growth but also preventing the atypical visceral obesity and some metabolic deregulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195876</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195876</link><published>1523653200000</published><title>Early postnatal soluble FGFR3 therapy prevents the atypical development of obesity in achondroplasia</title><fingerprint>8c4a69f3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Celine Saint-Laurent, Stephanie Garcia, Vincent Sarrazy, Karine Dumas, Florence Authier, Sophie Sore, Albert Tran, Philippe Gual, Isabelle Gennero, Jean-Pierre Salles, Elvire Gouze&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about 11% of Tuberculosis (TB) cases occur in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and it is the leading cause of death in this population. An important step towards reducing the incidence and mortality of TB in PLHIV is to reduce the time from onset of symptoms to treatment. Factors related to TB treatment delay therefore need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with TB at the National Institute of Infectious Disease, at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil we conducted a survival analysis to identify factors associated with patient and health care treatment delay. In our analysis we included patients who were co-infected with TB and HIV (n = 201). Patients were followed during the course of their TB treatment and information regarding duration of symptoms, sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were collected at the baseline visit.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median time from onset of initial symptoms to prescription of TB treatment (total delay) was 82 days. From initiation of symptoms to first visit at INI clinic (patient delay), the median was 51 days. From first visit to initiation of treatment (health care delay) the median was 16 days. Illiteracy was associated with greater patient delay [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.25, CI 95% 1.29–3.94]. Having had a previous episode of TB (HR = 0.53, CI 95% 0.37–0.74) and being married (HR = 0.71, CI 95% 0.54–0.94) were inversely related to patient delay. Illiteracy was also associated with greater health care delay (HR = 2.83, CI 95% 1.25–5.47) in contrast to high viral load (HR = 0.37, CI 95% 0.24–0.54) and weight loss greater than 10% (HR = 0.54, CI 95% 0.37–0.8), both of which were inversely related to health care delay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study highlights the existence of factors that lead to greater risk of delayed treatment of TB among patients co-infected with HIV and TB. These include factors that can be assessed through targeted interventions which have implications for improving treatment outcomes and, through reduced duration of infectiousness, reduce the incidence of TB in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195409</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195409</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Factors associated with tuberculosis treatment delay in patients co-infected with HIV in a high prevalence area in Brazil</title><fingerprint>1d85d779</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Betânia M.

Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against complement protein C5, is considered to be the current standard of care for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. This study describes the generation and preclinical attributes of ALXN1210, a new long-acting anti-C5 mAb, obtained through select modifications to eculizumab to both largely abolish target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and increase recycling efficiency via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). To attenuate the effect of TMDD on plasma terminal half-life (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;), histidine substitutions were engineered into the complementarity-determining regions of eculizumab to enhance the dissociation rate of the mAb:C5 complex in the acidic early endosome relative to the slightly basic pH of blood. Antibody variants with optimal pH-dependent binding to C5 exhibited little to no TMDD in mice in the presence of human C5. To further enhance the efficiency of FcRn-mediated recycling of the antibody, two additional substitutions were introduced to increase affinity for human FcRn. These substitutions yielded an additional doubling of the t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; of surrogate anti-mouse C5 antibodies with reduced TMDD in transgenic mice expressing the human FcRn. In conclusion, ALXN1210 is a promising new therapeutic candidate currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Design and preclinical characterization of ALXN1210: A novel anti-C5 antibody with extended duration of action</title><fingerprint>715cda6d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Douglas Sheridan, Zhao-Xue Yu, Yuchun Zhang, Rekha Patel, Fang Sun, Melissa A.

These substitutions yielded an additional doubling of the t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; of surrogate anti-mouse C5 antibodies with reduced TMDD in transgenic mice expressing the human FcRn. In conclusion, ALXN1210 is a promising new therapeutic candidate currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</canonicalUrl><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66da:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293621v1?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Wen, J.

Participants: All patients who obtained a HVF 24-2 at the University of Washington. Methods: All datapoints from consecutive 24-2 HVFs from 1998 to 2018 were extracted from a University of Washington database. Ten-fold cross validation with a held out test set was used to develop the three main phases of model development: model architecture selection, dataset combination selection, and time-interval model training with transfer learning, to train a deep learning artificial neural network capable of generating a point-wise visual field prediction. Main outcome measures: Mean absolute error (MAE) and difference in Mean Deviation (MD) between predicted and actual future HVF. Results: More than 1.7 million perimetry points were extracted to the hundredth decibel from 32,443 24-2 HVFs. The best performing model with 20 million trainable parameters, CascadeNet-5, was selected. The overall MAE for the test set was 2.47 dB (95% CI: 2.45 dB to 2.48 dB). The 100 fully trained models were able to successfully predict progressive field loss in glaucomatous eyes up to 5.5 years in the future with a correlation of 0.92 between the MD of predicted and actual future HVF (p &amp;lt; 2.2 x 10-16) and an average difference of 0.41 dB.

Background &lt;p&gt;Linkage to and retention in care for US persons living with HIV (PLWH) after release from jail usually declines. We know of no rigorously evaluated behavioral interventions that can improve this. We hypothesized that a strengths-based case management intervention that we developed for PLWH leaving jail would increase linkage/retention in care (indicated by receipt of laboratory draws) and a suppressed HIV viral load (VL) in the year following release.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We conducted a quasi-experimental feasibility study of our intervention for PLWH jailed in Atlanta. We recruited 113 PLWH in jail starting in 2014. “SUCCESS” (Sustained, Unbroken Connection to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) began in jail and continued post-release. Subjects who started the intervention but subsequently began long-term incarcerations were excluded from further analysis. Persons who were retained in the intervention group were compared to contemporaneously incarcerated PLWH who did not receive the intervention. Identities were submitted to an enhanced HIV/AIDS reporting system (eHARS) at the state health department to capture all laboratories drawn. Both community engagement and care upon jail return were assessed equally. For 44 intervention participants released to Atlanta, 50% of care occurred on subsequent jail stays, as documented with EventFlow software. Forty-five receiving usual services only were recruited for comparison. By examining records of jail reentries, half of participants and 60% of controls recidivated (range: 1–8 returns). All but 6 participants in the intervention and 9 subjects in the comparison arm had ≥1 laboratory recorded in eHARS post-release. Among the intervention group, 52% were retained in care (i.e., had two laboratory studies, &gt; = 3 months apart), versus 40% among the comparison group (OR = 1.60, 95% CI (0.71, 3.81)). Both arms showed improved viral load suppression.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a trend towards increased retention for PLWH released from jail after SUCCESS, compared to usual services.

Background &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks have occurred in some countries despite supplementary immunization activities (SIA) using measles-containing vaccine with high vaccination coverage. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey to estimate population immunity in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic where repeated mass immunization has failed to eliminate measles.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;In this nationwide multistage cluster sampling survey conducted in 2014 based on probability proportionate to size sampling, blood samples were collected from 2,135 children and adults living in 52 randomly selected villages. Anti-measles and anti-rubella IgG were measured, and IgG prevalence was calculated. We applied mathematical modelling to estimate the number of cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in 2013 that were averted by the 2011 SIA. A stability testing was applied to the MR vaccine at 4°C, 25°C, and 35°C to examine stability differences between measles and rubella vaccine components. Measles IgG prevalence was significantly lower in the target age groups (5–21 years) of the 2011 SIA using a combination vaccine for measles and rubella vaccine (MR vaccine) than in young adults (22–39 years) (86.8% [95% CI: 83.0–90.6] vs. 99.0% [98.3–99.8]; p&amp;lt;0.001), whereas rubella IgG prevalence was significantly higher (88.2% [84.5–91.8] vs. 74.6% [70.7–78.5]; p&amp;lt;0.001). In the SIA target age groups, prevalence of measles IgG, but not rubella IgG, increased with age. CRS cases prevented in 2013 ranged from 16 [0–50] to 92 [32–180] if the force of infection had remained unchanged or had been reduced by 75%, respectively. In freeze-dried conditions, the measles vaccine component was more heat sensitive than the rubella component.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Inconsistent IgG prevalence between measles and rubella in Lao PDR can be partly explained by different stability of the measles and rubella vaccine components under heat exposure. Suboptimal vaccine handling may cause insufficient immunogenicity for measles, which subsequently leads to an outbreak despite high SIA coverage, while direct evidence is lacking. Temperature monitoring of the vaccine should be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194931</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194931</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Evaluation of nationwide supplementary immunization in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic: Population-based seroprevalence survey of anti-measles and anti-rubella IgG in children and adults, mathematical modelling and a stability testing of the vaccine</title><fingerprint>d0bb5f0f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Masahiko Hachiya, Shinsuke Miyano, Yoshio Mori, Emilia Vynnycky, Phath Keungsaneth, Phengta Vongphrachanh, Anonh Xeuatvongsa, Thongchanh Sisouk, Vilasak Som-Oulay, Bouaphan Khamphaphongphane, Bounthanom Sengkeopaseuth, Chansay Pathammavong, Kongxay Phounphenghak, Tomomi Kitamura, Makoto Takeda, Katsuhiro Komase&lt;/p&gt;

Temperature monitoring of the vaccine should be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194931</canonicalUrl><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293175v1?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Dali, R.</name></author><description>Motivation: Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) are chromatin structures that can be identified by analysis of Hi-C data.

So far I have yet to come across a drug discovery organization that really thinks that its compound libraries are what they should be – there are too many of those similar compounds from those similar projects that we used to be into back when, there are too many of those compounds that we purchased from vendors X and Y and Z, there are too many insoluble ones or decomposing ones or just plain boring ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s natural to think that the way to better screening results is to have a better compound collection – I mean, what could be more obvious? And it’s also obvious that every compound collection could always improve – it could be larger, or less greasy, or less streaked with legacy compounds that have too much baggage, etc. I don’t think it ever does harm to address these issues. The question is, how much good does it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask that question just because of the numbers involved. You have the numbers in your own collection, and you have the numbers in chemical space in general. The first is probably pretty large, and the second is larger than any human mind can deal with. Any one company’s compound collection – any one &lt;em&gt;planet’s&lt;/em&gt; compound collection – is a tiny mote in the sky of chemical space, even broadly druglike chemical space. So you’re not going to make much headway on the absolute scale, no matter how many diversity compounds you can get into vials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to the relative scale, then, you’re still going to have to make a pretty big effort to change your own collection’s character. This is why organizations have, over the years, tended to divide their collections into subfractions. Here are X thousand compounds to represent the deck as a whole – that’s something to use to try an assay out to troubleshoot it and get an idea of what the hit rate will be if you go on. Here’s the fraction of the deck that meets these particular biophysical criteria (and over here is the fraction of the deck that doesn’t). Here’s the fragment collection, here’s the more natural-product-like end of things, here’s the deliberately more three-dimensional set, and so on. In some (many?) companies, a classic screen-the-whole-deck situation has gotten more rare over the years, although there are always targets that need that and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up another consideration: sometimes you want more compounds because you’re not really getting any actionable hits in a screen (particularly against those tough targets). And sometimes you want more compounds because while you’re getting real hits, they’re not hits that you like. Maybe they’re from those legacy projects and the IP/selectivity considerations are too much of a hairball, or they’re coming out too nonpolar or with too few vectors for further optimization, what have you. You’d rather start somewhere else, and the deck doesn’t give you as many somewhere-elses as you’d want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the second category has a better chance of being fixed by adding swaths of new compounds – at least you know that the target is capable of binding small molecules. Now, it can always be the problem that the target just wants ugly chemical matter (CETP is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/06/29/the_cetp_rogues_gallery&quot;&gt;classic example&lt;/a&gt;), in which case there may not be much to do about it, but there will surely be other projects where something more workable presents itself. But the first category – just not getting hits – is a tougher situation. You can get stuck in an unprovable-hypothesis loop: if you didn’t get hits, you need more compounds. So you add more, and you didn’t get hits – well, you didn’t add enough, or the right ones. Who’s to say that the winner isn’t just over the horizon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a question that combichem was supposed to help answer back about twenty years ago or so, and it’s the question that its sequel, DNA-encoded library screening, is supposed to help answer now. From the beginning, the tricky part of the latter compounds sets has been the number of reactions compatible with the attached DNA barcodes. Combichem had that problem, too, in its early days: what price another ten thousand aryl amides? But (partly because of that grim experience) the DEL folks have been, right from the start, trying to expand their synthetic universe, and these efforts continue. My read so far on DEL screening is that it’s a very useful technique, but (as is always the case) not a magic bullet. People outside of drug discovery always seem to be amazed that we can screen a million compounds and not find something that binds to Target X, and they’d be even more amazed to know that you can run a whole series of DELs, containing (well, most likely) as many compounds as there are people on earth, and still not get a hit, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are also questions that DOS, diversity-oriented synthesis, was designed to help answer. I’ve always had &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/11/11/and_one_was_just_right&quot;&gt;reservations about that concept&lt;/a&gt;, but there have been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.2420&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30249-0&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; papers that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066158/&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt; to come out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392761/&quot;&gt;screening&lt;/a&gt; such collections. You can also see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171204/&quot;&gt;synthetic&lt;/a&gt; work &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.7b01776&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b06994&quot;&gt;reactions&lt;/a&gt; to make more diverse compounds sets feasible. Those papers, and more like them, are uncovered through a PubMed search on “Schreiber SL”, although there are others. One problem, though, is that a search for “diversity oriented synthesis” itself turns up both these papers and a mound of other stuff besides. There are an awful lot of papers that appropriate the term to mean “We made a bunch of stuff because we could and here it is”. The uncharitable view is that’s what the early DOS papers from the Broad added up to as well, but believe me, this other stuff is really the pits. When you see someone banging out a bunch of (say) chalcones and slapping a “diversity-oriented synthesis” label on the resulting work, well, it really makes you roll your eyes. Schreiber must love it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But has the DOS concept caught on outside the Broad Institute? It’s pretty labor-intensive, from a synthetic chemistry standpoint, although it’s designed to minimize that as much as possible once its time to actually make the libraries. But that’s a real “measure twice, cut once” situation; the last thing you want to do is rip into a big library synthesis that generates a bunch of half-made and truncated stuff instead of your desired Land of Diversity. I would like to have a better feel for how this is all working out. It may be that only organizations with significant manpower and funding can make a go of it, and significant bravery/nerve may be a requirement as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now DOS is, in the grand scheme of things, a series of shots into that gigantic chemical space mentioned above, and you could spend a lifetime at it and never make a dent in the number of untested areas – but (as above) is that the relevant question? The current version of it appears to be providing some interesting hits against interesting targets, and what more can you ask? It would be very worthwhile to study the hit rates (and hit quality) of DOS screening as practiced at the Broad versus what comes out of more conventional large compound collections, but if a large-scale comparison of this sort is publicly available, I’ve missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thoughts? How much effort is appropriate to beef up the screening collection, and what kind of return can one expect? Are you better letting the vendors clean out their closets and sell the stuff to you, or trying to make compounds yourself/pay someone to make them? What’s the comparative return on those? And the return versus and investment in DNA-encoded library technology (versus paying someone who does it already?) And does anyone do DOS-like stuff for themselves? Comments welcomed. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Drug Assays</item><item>Life in the Drug Labs</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1629b4f6aaf:2b8afa:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523024095919</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/06/thoughts-on-compound-collections</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.1002626</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><author><name>The PLOS Biology Staff</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS Biology Staff &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot;

Supplying food for the anticipated global population of over 9 billion in 2050 under changing climate conditions is one of the major challenges of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Agricultural expansion and intensification contributes to global environmental change and risks the long-term sustainability of the planet. It has been proposed that no more than 15% of the global ice-free land surface should be converted to cropland. Bioenergy production for land-based climate mitigation places additional pressure on limited land resources. Here we test normative targets of food supply and bioenergy production within the cropland planetary boundary using a global land-use model. The results suggest supplying the global population with adequate food is possible without cropland expansion exceeding the planetary boundary. Yet this requires an increase in food production, especially in developing countries, as well as a decrease in global crop yield gaps. However, under current assumptions of future food requirements, it was not possible to also produce significant amounts of first generation bioenergy without cropland expansion. These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194695</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194695</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Food supply and bioenergy production within the global cropland planetary boundary</title><fingerprint>2f96cfa1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by R.

These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194695</canonicalUrl><updated>1521752400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34aa:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368c</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Biotechnology</title></origin><author><name>Supratim Mukherjee</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: 1,003 reference genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates expand coverage of the tree of life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: 1,003 reference genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates expand coverage of the tree of life, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368c&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt0418-368c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: 1,003 reference genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates expand coverage of the tree of life</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368c</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368c</link><published>1522911600000</published><title>Erratum: 1,003 reference genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates expand coverage of the tree of life</title><fingerprint>674019c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: 1,003 reference genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates expand coverage of the tree of life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: 1,003 reference genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates expand coverage of the tree of life, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0418-368c&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt0418-368c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: 1,003 reference genomes of bacterial and archaeal isolates expand coverage of the tree of life</content></content><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_16296980fd7:a466568:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522944970711</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01795</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Siegfried H.

IgnacyCukrowski</name></author><description>Novel measures of electron (de)localization within the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) atomic basins are presented which, unlike orthodox localization indices (LIs), are fully exclusive and can be easily visualized. This work shows that QTAIM‐defined LIs describe a portion of interatomic delocalized electrons; hence, the chemical/physical interpretation of orthodox LIs is misleading. Using the recently introduced Fragment, Atomic, Localized, Delocalized, and Interatomic (FALDI) density decomposition technique we derive two novel sets of LIs and delocalization indices (DIs), by accounting for the overlap between localized and delocalized density functions. The FALDI‐based LIs and DIs perfectly recover chemically expected core and bonded electron count. Usefulness of new (de)localization indices and their 3D representations were demonstrated on a number of examples, including formamide and benzene. We therefore expect that the scheme reported in this work will provide a valuable stepping stone between classical conceptual chemistry and quantum chemical topology. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25223?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Novel measures of electron (de)localization within the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) atomic basins are presented which, unlike orthodox localization indices (LIs), are fully exclusive and can be easily visualized.

Background &lt;p&gt;The impact of obesity on survival is known to vary in different cancers. Advanced biliary tract cancer was rarely analyzed about the relationship between obesity and prognosis. We performed this study to evaluate the BMI and body weight change as prognostic factors for advanced biliary tract cancer patients with palliative chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between January 2005 and December 2016, two hundred and seventy-six patients who underwent chemotherapy for biliary tract cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The relationship between BMI (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and clinical outcomes including overall and progression-free survival was assessed. Additionally the relationship between change in body composition and overall survival was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Median overall survival was 9.7 months for underweight patients, 10.1 months for normal patients, 15.8 months for overweight group, 13.1 months for obese patients, respectively. (p = 0.047) Univariate analysis showed that BMI, stage III, age less than 64 year-old, gallbladder cancer, operation, radiotherapy and ECOG performance were significantly associated with better survival. Compared with normal patients, overweight patients (BMI 23–24.9kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) had a reduced risk of mortality in multivariate analysis (HR 0.632; 95% CI 0.436–0.918, p = 0.016). In the additional analysis for the effect of changes in body weight and BMI to the overall survival, decrease in body weight and BMI (HR 1.410, 95% CI 1.168–1.986, p = 0.046) was associated with a shorter in overall survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Overweight status and the maintenance of body weight during the initial period of chemotherapy are important and independent predictors of better overall survival in advanced biliary tract cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195118</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195118</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Body mass index and weight change during initial period of chemotherapy affect survival outcome in advanced biliary tract cancer patients</title><fingerprint>fbc1694c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinwoo Kang, Sang Hyub Lee, Jun Hyuk Son, Jae Woo Lee, Young Hoon Choi, Jin Ho Choi, Woo Hyun Paik, Ji Kon Ryu, Yong-Tae Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Anthocyanins are naturally active substances. In this study, anthocyanins from black rice were obtained by membrane filtration and column chromatography separation. Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, not only the pH of the media containing C3G was lower than that of the extract of black rice anthocyanin (BRAE), but the numbers of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were also significantly increased. Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195754</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195754</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Metabolism and prebiotics activity of anthocyanins from black rice (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.) &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>7673a56e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yongsheng Zhu, Hanju Sun, Shudong He, Qiuyan Lou, Min Yu, Mingming Tang, Lijun Tu&lt;/p&gt;

Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195754</canonicalUrl><updated>1523307600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a5:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/525/eaao5775?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Signaling current issue</title></origin><author><name>Ogunbayo, O.

From whole organisms to individual cells, responses to environmental conditions are influenced by genetic makeup, where the effect of genetic variation on a trait depends on the environmental context. RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic and environmental effects. In this study, we explore opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to discover &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting genotype-environment interactions (GxE)—genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Interactions between genetic variation and cellular environment in skeletal muscle gene expression</title><fingerprint>278c3df4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by D.

We applied an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; selection approach using two different plant lectins that bind to α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acids to determine which genetic changes of the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus alter hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding toward α2,3- or α2,6-linked glycans. Consecutive passages of the A/California/04/09 virus with or without lectins in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells led to development of three HA1 amino acid substitutions, N129D, G155E, and S183P, and one mutation in the neuraminidase (NA), G201E. The S183P mutation significantly increased binding to several α2,6 SA-linked glycans, including YDS, 6′SL(N), and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to the wild-type virus (↑3.6-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Two other HA1 mutations, N129D and G155E, were sufficient to significantly increase binding to α2,6-linked glycans, 6′SLN and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to S183P (↑4.1-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). These HA1 mutations also increased binding affinity for 3′SLN glycan compared to the wild-type virus as measured by Biacore surface plasmon resonance method. In addition, the HA1 N129D and HA1 G155E substitutions were identified as antigenic mutations. Furthermore, the G201E mutation in NA reduced the NA enzyme activity (↓2.3-fold). These findings demonstrate that the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus can acquire enhanced receptor affinity for both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic receptors under lectin-induced selective pressure. Such changes in binding affinity are conferred by selection of beneficial HA1 mutations that affect receptor specificity, antigenicity, and/or functional compatibility with the NA protein.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195525</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195525</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>The use of plant lectins to regulate H1N1 influenza A virus receptor binding activity</title><fingerprint>4588b250</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicolette Lee, Alexey M.

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction following left ventricular (LV) failure is associated with poor prognosis. RV remodeling is thought initiated by the increase in the afterload of RV due to secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) to impaired LV function; however, RV molecular changes might occur in earlier stages of the disease. cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)-phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, widely used to treat PH through their pulmonary vasorelaxation properties, have shown direct cardiac benefits, but their impacts on the RV in LV diseases are not fully determined. Here we show that RV molecular alterations occur early in the absence of RV hemodynamic changes during LV pressure-overload and are ameliorated by PDE5 inhibition. Two-day moderate LV pressure-overload (transverse aortic constriction) neither altered RV pressure/ function nor RV weight in mice, while it induced only mild LV hypertrophy. Importantly, pathological molecular features were already induced in the RV free wall myocardium, including up-regulation of gene markers for hypertrophy and inflammation, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and calcineurin. Concomitant PDE5 inhibition (sildenafil) prevented induction of such pathological genes and activation of ERK and calcineurin in the RV as well as in the LV. Importantly, dexamethasone also prevented these RV molecular changes, similarly to sildenafil treatment. These results suggest the contributory role of inflammation to the early pathological interventricular interaction between RV and LV. The current study provides the first evidence for the novel early molecular cross-talk between RV and LV, preceding RV hemodynamic changes in LV disease, and supports the therapeutic strategy of enhancing cGMP signaling pathway to treat heart diseases.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195528</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195528</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Sildenafil ameliorates right ventricular early molecular derangement during left ventricular pressure overload</title><fingerprint>727a0802</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yousuke Imai, Taro Kariya, Masaki Iwakiri, Yoshitsugu Yamada, Eiki Takimoto&lt;/p&gt;

We demonstrate a simple, powerful, and likely generalizable strategy of integrating strengths of single-cell approaches into conventional &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; systems to study complex clock functions.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33549</link><published>1522886400000</published><title>A robust and tunable mitotic oscillator in artificial cells</title><fingerprint>ef54757b</fingerprint><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16295b869fc:a2b1bf4:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522930313724</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33549</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288324v1?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><author><name>Wang, Y.</name></author><description>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common mutation in CF, an in-frame deletion of phenylalanine 508, leads to a trafficking defect and endoplasmic reticulum retention of the protein where it becomes targeted for degradation. Successful clinical deployments of ivacaftor and ivacaftor/lumacaftor combination have been an exciting translational development in treating CF.

We used the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database as our chemical pool to screen for candidates. For in silico screening, we integrated connectivity mapping and CF systems biology to identify candidate therapeutic compounds for CF. Following in silico screening, we validated our candidate compounds with (i) an enteroid-based compound screening assay using CF ({Delta}F508/{Delta}F508-CFTR) patient-derived enteroids, (ii) short-circuit current analysis using polarized CF primary human airway epithelial cells and (iii) Western blots to measure F508-del-CFTR protein maturation. We identified 184 candidate compounds with in silico screening and tested 24 of them with enteroid-based forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay. The top hit compound was PP2, a known src-kinase inhibitor that induced swelling in enteroid comparable to known CF corrector (lumacaftor). Further validation with Western blot and short circuit current analysis showed that PP-2 could correct mutant CFTR mis-folding and restore CFTR-mediated transmembrane current. We have identified PP2, a known src-kinase inhibitor, as a novel corrector of {Delta}F508-CFTR. Based on our studies and previous reports, src kinase inhibition may represent a novel paradigm of multi-action therapeutics - corrector, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infective - in CF.</description><engagement>33</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288324v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288324v1?rss=1</link><published>1521874800000</published><title>PP-2, a src-kinase inhibitor, is a potential corrector for F508del-CFTR in cystic fibrosis [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>5445f494</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.

This national online cross-sectional survey in Italy assessed primary care pediatricians’ (PCPs) attitudes and practices regarding Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and the contribution of several characteristics. The questionnaire was distributed from September 2016 to June 2017 to a random sample of 640 PCPs by email via an internet-link leading to a web-based survey platform (Lime Survey). Only 18.4% of PCPs always recommend the HPV vaccine to 11–12 year old boys. PCPs with longer practice activity, working in solo practice, always recommended the HPV vaccine to 11–12 year old girls, and believed that the vaccine was effective for boys were more likely to always recommend the HPV vaccine. PCPs working in a Region where the vaccination was actively recommended and provided free of charge to 11–12 year old boys had higher odds of recommending vaccination. More than two thirds of PCPs (77.4%) always recommend the HPV vaccine to 11–12 year old girls. PCPs who believed that the vaccine was effective for girls and safe in both boys and girls, who always talk with patients of 11–18 years or their parents about HPV infection and vaccination, and who obtain vaccine information from scientific journals were more likely to always recommend the vaccine. PCPs should employ evidence-based educational strategies in order to achieve a better coverage and to reduce the morbidities and mortality of diseases associated with HPV.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194920</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194920</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Primary care pediatricians’ attitudes and practice towards HPV vaccination: A nationwide survey in Italy</title><fingerprint>ee3168a7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Napolitano, Monica Navaro, Luigi Vezzosi, Gabriella Santagati, Italo Francesco Angelillo&lt;/p&gt;

The mimetic juveniles of a number of carangid fish species resemble plant parts floating near the water surface, such as leaves, seeds and other plant debris. The present study is the first to verify the morphological similarities and ecomorphological relationships between three carangids (&lt;i&gt;Oligoplites saurus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Oligoplites palometa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trachinotus falcatus&lt;/i&gt;) and their associated plant models. Behavioral observations were conducted in the estuary of Curuçá River, in northeastern Pará (Brazil) between August 2015 and July 2016. Individual fishes and associated floating objects (models) were sampled for comparative analysis using both geometric and morphometric approaches. While the mimetic fish and their models retain their own distinct, intrinsic morphological features, a high degree of morphological similarity was found between each fish species and its model. The morphometric analyses revealed a general tendency of isometric development in all three fish species, probably related to their pelagic habitats, during all ontogenetic stages.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194437</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194437</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Scaling mimesis: Morphometric and ecomorphological similarities in three sympatric plant-mimetic fish of the family Carangidae (Teleostei)</title><fingerprint>14d8416f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alexya Cunha de Queiroz, Marcelo Vallinoto, Yoichi Sakai, Tommaso Giarrizzo, Breno Barros&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;China is the largest developing country with a relatively developed public health system. To further prevent and eliminate the spread of infectious diseases, China has listed 39 notifiable infectious diseases characterized by wide prevalence or great harm, and classified them into classes A, B, and C, with severity decreasing across classes. Class A diseases have been almost eradicated in China, thus making class B diseases a priority in infectious disease prevention and control. In this retrospective study, we analyze the spatial distribution patterns of 12 class B notifiable infectious diseases that remain active all over China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global and local Moran’s I and corresponding graphic tools are adopted to explore and visualize the global and local spatial distribution of the incidence of the selected epidemics, respectively.

Background &lt;p&gt;China is the largest developing country with a relatively developed public health system. To further prevent and eliminate the spread of infectious diseases, China has listed 39 notifiable infectious diseases characterized by wide prevalence or great harm, and classified them into classes A, B, and C, with severity decreasing across classes. Class A diseases have been almost eradicated in China, thus making class B diseases a priority in infectious disease prevention and control. In this retrospective study, we analyze the spatial distribution patterns of 12 class B notifiable infectious diseases that remain active all over China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global and local Moran’s I and corresponding graphic tools are adopted to explore and visualize the global and local spatial distribution of the incidence of the selected epidemics, respectively. Inter-correlations of clustering patterns of each pair of diseases and a cumulative summary of the high/low cluster frequency of the provincial units are also provided by means of figures and maps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 12 most commonly notifiable class B infectious diseases, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis show high incidence rates and account for more than half of the reported cases. Almost all the diseases, except pertussis, exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation at the provincial level. All diseases feature varying spatial concentrations.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</description><engagement>246</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194987</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194987</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review</title><fingerprint>30b1893b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica L.

Materials and methods; A total of 334 patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging before ultrasonography-guided transrectal 12-core prostate biopsy were enrolled in the analysis. Twenty-two non-selected variables as well as selected ones by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis and by stepwise logistic regression analysis were input into the constructed multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) programs. 232 patients were used as training cases of ANN programs, and the remaining 102 patients were for the test to output the probability of prostate cancer existence, accuracy of prostate cancer prediction, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the learned model. Results; With any prostate cancer objective variable, Lasso and stepwise regression analyses selected 12 and 9 explanatory variables from 22, respectively. In common between them, age at biopsy, findings on digital rectal examination, findings in the peripheral zone on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging, and body mass index were positively influential variables, while numbers of previous prostatic biopsy and prostate volume were negatively influential. Using trained ANNs with multiple hidden layers, the accuracy of predicting any prostate cancer in test samples was about 5-10% higher compared with that with logistic regression analysis (LR). The AUCs with multilayer ANN were significantly larger on inputting variables that were selected by the stepwise logistic regression compared with the AUC with LR. The ANN had a higher net-benefit than LR between prostate cancer probability cut-off values of 0.38 and 0.6. Conclusion; ANN accurately predicted prostate cancer without biopsy marginally better than LR.

Aquaculture is increasing rapidly to meet global seafood demand. Some hydroid populations have been linked to mortality and health issues in finfish and shellfish, but their dynamics in and around aquaculture farms remain understudied. In the present work, two experiments, each with 36 panels, tested colonization (factors: depth, season of immersion) and succession (factors: depth, submersion duration) over one year. Hydroid surface cover was estimated for each species, and data were analyzed with multivariate techniques. The assemblage of hydrozoans was species-poor, although species richness, frequency and abundance increased with time, paralleling the overall increase in structural complexity of fouling assemblages. Submersion duration and season of immersion were particularly important in determining the species composition of the assemblages in the succession and colonization experiments, respectively. Production of water-borne propagules, including medusae, from the hydroids was observed from locally abundant colonies, among them the well-known fouling species &lt;i&gt;Obelia dichotoma&lt;/i&gt;, potentially representing a nuisance for cultured fish through contact-driven envenomations and gill disorders. The results illustrate the potential importance of fouling hydroids and their medusae to the health of organisms in the aquaculture industry.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195352</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195352</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Successional dynamics of marine fouling hydroids (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) at a finfish aquaculture facility in the Mediterranean Sea</title><fingerprint>cbb54754</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luis Martell, Roberta Bracale, Steven A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests the presence of structural changes affecting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS). The aim of this study was to characterise the RV morphology in BrS and explore associations between morphologic, clinical, electrical, and genetic parameters using non-invasive multimodality testing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive BrS patients (recruited 2013–2015) underwent clinical assessment, dedicated RV imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (unless contra-indicated), electrical assessment (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG[SAECG]) and genotyping. Morphologic data were compared to matched control and unmatched ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) cohorts, and potential associations between morphologic parameters and other variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;BrS patients (n = 42, male 86%, age 46±12 years) exhibited normal global RV volume and function, comparable to control, in contrast to significantly larger, impaired RVs in ARVC cohort (RVESV p = 0.0001; RVEDV p&amp;lt;0.0001, RVEF p = 0.002). Compared with control, BrS patients exhibited larger RVOT volumes (7.4 ± 0.7 vs 5.8 ± 0.7 mL/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) (31% vs 0%, p = 0.005); compared with ARVC cohort, the RVOT volumes were similar (7.4 ± 0.7 vs, 8.1 ± 1.7, p = 0.52) and there were less RWMA (31% vs 76%, p = 0.01). Overall 67% BrS patients had abnormal RVOT morphology. Patients with abnormal RVOT tended to be older (48 ± 12 y vs 41 ± 12y, p = 0.06). Rare genetic variants were only observed in patients with abnormal RVOT morphology (36% vs 0%, p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with BrS frequently exhibit structural abnormalities localised to the RVOT and these changes may be age- and gene-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195594</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195594</link><published>1523653200000</published><title>Relations between right ventricular morphology and clinical, electrical and genetic parameters in Brugada Syndrome</title><fingerprint>a2399181</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Belinda Gray, Ganesh Kumar Gnanappa, Richard D.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Demographic change has led to an increase of older people in need of long-term care in nearly all European countries. Informal carers primarily provide the care and support needed by dependent people. The supply and willingness of individuals to act as carers are critical to sustain informal care resources as part of the home health care provision. This paper describes a longitudinal study of informal care in six European countries and reports analyses that determine those factors predicting the outcomes of family care over a one-year period.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Analyses are based on data from the EUROFAMCARE project, a longitudinal survey study of family carers of older people with baseline data collection in 2004 and follow-up data collection a year later in six European countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), N = 3,348. Descriptive statistics of the sample characteristics are reported. Binary logistic random-intercept regressions were computed, predicting the outcome of change of the care dyad’s status at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Where care is provided by a more distant family member or by a friend or neighbour, the care-recipient is significantly more likely to be cared for by someone else (OR 1.62) or to be in residential care (OR 3.37) after one year. The same holds true if the care-recipient has memory problems with a dementia diagnosis (OR 1.79/OR 1.84). Higher dependency (OR 1.22) and behavioural problems (OR 1.76) in the care-recipient also lead to a change of care dyad status. Country of residence explained a relatively small amount of variance (8%) in whether a care-recipient was cared for by someone else after one year, but explained a substantial amount of variance (52%) in whether a care-recipient was in residential care. Particularly in Sweden, care-recipients are much more likely to be cared for by another family or professional carer or to be in residential care, whereas in Greece the status of the care dyad is much less likely to change.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The majority of family carers continued to provide care to their respective older relatives over a one-year period, despite often high levels of functional, cognitive and behavioural problems in the care-recipient. Those family carers could benefit most from appropriate support. The carer/care-recipient relationship plays an important role in whether or not a family care dyad remains intact over a one-year period. The support of health and social care services should be particularly targeted toward those care dyads where there is no partner or spouse acting as carer, or no extended family network that might absorb the caring role when required.

To move a hard table together, humans may coordinate by following the dominant partner’s motion [1–4], but this strategy is unsuitable for a soft mattress where the perceived forces are small. How do partners readily coordinate in such differing interaction dynamics? To address this, we investigated how pairs tracked a target using flexion-extension of their wrists, which were coupled by a hard, medium or soft virtual elastic band. Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, who had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled partner’s muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one’s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information. This model elucidates the versatile mechanism by which humans can coordinate during both hard and soft physical interactions to ensure maximum performance with minimal effort.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bXD1PWYahz8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1521752400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1624ed0b0a5:56eca:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atsushi Takagi, Francesco Usai, Gowrishankar Ganesh, Vittorio Sanguineti, Etienne Burdet&lt;/p&gt;

Modulating immune responses to sepsis and trauma remain one of the most difficult challenges in modern medicine. Large burn injuries (LBI) are a severe form of trauma associated with sepsis, immune impairment, and mortality. Immune dysfunction after LBI is complex, involving both enhanced and impaired immune activation. The release of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, and cytokines (e.g. IL-1β) creates an environment of immune dysfunction often leading to end organ failure and death. Both HMGB1 and IL-1β have been found to play critical roles in sepsis and post-burn immune dysfunction. HMGB1 and IL-1β have been shown previously to form potent complexes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We recently identified the presence of HMGB1/IL-1β heterocomplexes in human tissue. We now find HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in human and mouse plasma, and identify a synergistic role of HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in post-burn immune dysfunction. In both humans and mice, we found that HMGB1 was enriched in plasma microvesicles (MVs) after LBI. HMGB1 was found form complexes with IL-1β. Using flow cytometry of mouse plasma MVs, we identified an increase in an HMGB1+/IL-1β+ MVs. Using co-IP, HMGB1 was found to bind the pro-form of IL-1β in mouse and human plasma. Pro-IL-1β, which is traditionally considered inactive, became active when complexed with HMGB1. Human THP-1 monocytes treated with HMGB1-pro-IL-1β complexes showed increased transcription of LBI associated cytokines IL-6 and IFNβ along with suppression of iNOS, mimicking findings associated with LBI. These findings identify that HMGB1/IL-1β complexes released after burn injuries can modulate immune responses, and microvesicles are identified as a novel reservoir for these immune mediators. These complexes might serve as novel immune targets for the treatment of systemic immune responses due to LBI or other causes of sepsis.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195335</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195335</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in plasma microvesicles modulate immune responses to burn injury</title><fingerprint>194fb99a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Leon G.

The release of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, and cytokines (e.g. IL-1β) creates an environment of immune dysfunction often leading to end organ failure and death. Both HMGB1 and IL-1β have been found to play critical roles in sepsis and post-burn immune dysfunction. HMGB1 and IL-1β have been shown previously to form potent complexes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We recently identified the presence of HMGB1/IL-1β heterocomplexes in human tissue. We now find HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in human and mouse plasma, and identify a synergistic role of HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in post-burn immune dysfunction. In both humans and mice, we found that HMGB1 was enriched in plasma microvesicles (MVs) after LBI. HMGB1 was found form complexes with IL-1β. Using flow cytometry of mouse plasma MVs, we identified an increase in an HMGB1+/IL-1β+ MVs. Using co-IP, HMGB1 was found to bind the pro-form of IL-1β in mouse and human plasma. Pro-IL-1β, which is traditionally considered inactive, became active when complexed with HMGB1. Human THP-1 monocytes treated with HMGB1-pro-IL-1β complexes showed increased transcription of LBI associated cytokines IL-6 and IFNβ along with suppression of iNOS, mimicking findings associated with LBI. These findings identify that HMGB1/IL-1β complexes released after burn injuries can modulate immune responses, and microvesicles are identified as a novel reservoir for these immune mediators. These complexes might serve as novel immune targets for the treatment of systemic immune responses due to LBI or other causes of sepsis.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195335</canonicalUrl><updated>1522443600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c5b:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03818-w</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;World’s longest animal boasts a potent poison&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World’s longest animal boasts a potent poison, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03818-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03818-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The bootlace worm’s mucus is loaded with a powerful nerve toxin.</description><engagement>426</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03818-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03818-w</link><published>1521702000000</published><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>a1134420</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;World’s longest animal boasts a potent poison&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World’s longest animal boasts a potent poison, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03818-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03818-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The bootlace worm’s mucus is loaded with a powerful nerve toxin.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1624ece19ef:411f945:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03818-w/d41586-018-03818-w_15555784.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1521740552687</crawled><title>World’s longest animal boasts a potent poison</title></item></channel></rss>
