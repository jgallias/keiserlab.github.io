According to the Climatic Variability Hypothesis [CVH], thermal plasticity should be wider in organisms from temperate environments, but is unlikely to occur in tropical latitudes where temperature fluctuations are narrow. In copepods, food availability has been suggested as the main driver of phenotypic variability in adult size if the range of temperature change is less than 14°C. &lt;i&gt;Leptodiaptomus garciai&lt;/i&gt; is a calanoid copepod inhabiting Lake Alchichica, a monomictic, tropical lake in Mexico that experiences regular, narrow temperature fluctuations but wide changes in phytoplankton availability. We investigated whether the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food produce phenotypic variation in the life-history traits of this tropical species. We sampled &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;garciai&lt;/i&gt; throughout a year and measured female size, egg size and number, and hatching success, along with temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The amplitude of the plastic responses was estimated with the Phenotypic Plasticity Index. This index was also computed for a published dataset of 84 copepod populations to look if there is a relationship between the amplitude of the phenotypic plasticity of adult size and seasonal change in temperature. The temperature annual range in Lake Alchichica was 3.2°C, whereas phytoplankton abundance varied 17-fold. A strong pattern of thermal plasticity in egg size and adult female size followed the inverse relationship with temperature commonly observed in temperate environments, although its adaptive value was not demonstrated. Egg number, relative reproductive effort and number of nauplii per female were clearly plastic to food availability, allowing organisms to increase their fitness. When comparing copepod species from different latitudes, we found that the magnitude of thermal plasticity of adult size is not related to the range of temperature variation; furthermore, thermal plasticity exists even in environments of limited temperature variation, where the response is more intense compared to temperate populations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Ortega-Mayagoitia, Osvaldo Hernández-Martínez, Jorge Ciros-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells primarily by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in the β-cell membrane. The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Proks, Holger Kramer, Elizabeth Haythorne, Frances M.

Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beau Oldenburg, Marijtje Van Duijn, René Veenstra&lt;/p&gt;

Biological experiments involving genomics or other high-throughput assays typically yield a data matrix that can be explored and analyzed using the R programming language with packages from the Bioconductor project. Improvements in the throughput of these assays have resulted in an explosion of data even from routine experiments, which poses a challenge to the existing computational infrastructure for statistical data analysis. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments frequently generate large matrices containing expression values for each gene in each cell, requiring sparse or file-backed representations for memory-efficient manipulation in R. These alternative representations are not easily compatible with high-performance C++ code used for computationally intensive tasks in existing R/Bioconductor packages. Here, we describe a C++ interface named &lt;i&gt;beachmat&lt;/i&gt;, which enables agnostic data access from various matrix representations. This allows package developers to write efficient C++ code that is interoperable with dense, sparse and file-backed matrices, amongst others. We evaluated the performance of &lt;i&gt;beachmat&lt;/i&gt; for accessing data from each matrix representation using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, and defined a clear memory/speed trade-off to motivate the choice of an appropriate representation. We also demonstrate how beachmat can be incorporated into the code of other packages to drive analyses of a very large scRNA-seq data set.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MHxJ8eSA7PU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aaron T.

In addition, GSK-J4 was effective at blocking the growth of chemorefractory and patient-derived xenograft models of high-risk neuroblastoma in vivo.

Therefore, H3K27 demethylation inhibition is a promising therapeutic target to treat high-risk neuroblastoma, and H3K27 demethylation can be part of rational combination therapies to induce robust antineuroblastoma activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>64b33593</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>[Research Articles] Targeted inhibition of histone H3K27 demethylation is effective in high-risk neuroblastoma</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaao4680?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_162f9596747:383436:ae8b474d</id><crawled>1524601808711</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00181/20180424/images/medium/oc-2018-001817_0002.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>353</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1524542400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00181</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00181</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Luo Gu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00181/20180424/images/medium/oc-2018-001817_0002.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00181&lt;/div&gt;</description><fingerprint>e1a347a9</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00181/20180424/images/medium/oc-2018-001817_0002.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00181&lt;/div&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>[ASAP] Tailored Silica Nanomaterials for Immunotherapy</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00181</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7fa:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><published>1525974003000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/eaan5780?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/eaan5780.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/eaan5780?rss=1</originId><engagement>33</engagement><author><name>Ryu, K.

Despite progress toward automated force field parameterization, considerable human expertise is required to develop or extend force fields. In particular, human input has long been required to define atom types, which encode chemically unique environments that determine which parameters must be assigned. However, relying on humans to establish atom types is suboptimal: the resulting atom types are often unjustified from a statistical perspective, leading to over- or under-fitting; they are difficult to extend in a systematic and consistent manner when new chemistries must be modeled or new data becomes available; and human effort is not scalable when force fields must be generated for new (bio)polymers or materials. We aim to replace human specification of atom types with an automated approach, based on solid statistics and driven by experimental and/or quantum chemical reference data. Here, we describe a novel technology for this purpose, termed SMARTY, which generalizes atom typing by using direct chemical perception with SMARTS strings, and adopting a hierarchical approach to type assignment. The SMARTY technology enables creation of a move set in atom-typing space that can be used in a Monte Carlo optimization approach to atom typing. We demonstrate the power of this approach with a fully automated procedure that is able to re-discover human-defined atom types in the traditional small molecule force field parm99/parm@Frosst. Furthermore, we show how an extension of this approach that makes use of SMIRKS strings to match multiple atoms, which we term SMIRKY, allows us to take full advantage of the advances in direct chemical perception for valence types (bonds, angles, and torsions) afforded by the recently-proposed SMIRNOFF direct chemical perception force field typing language.

Comprehensive tests with various pair potentials show that the new method generally surpasses the Iterative Boltzmann Inversion method in terms of reliability of the numerical solution for the particle pair potential. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>Calculating particle pair potentials from fluid‐state pair correlations: Iterative ornstein–zernike inversion</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25225?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163632a4739:36d48b3:93d646dc</id><crawled>1526377105209</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25875-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25875_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>293</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><published>1526367600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25875-x</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25875-x</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25875-x</originId><engagement>8</engagement><author><name>Kaiyang Qiu</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecosystem functions including soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium are crucial for vegetation recovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem functions including soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium are crucial for vegetation recovery, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25875-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25875-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ecosystem functions including soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium are crucial for vegetation recovery&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/r1UHZ1ptL1o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecosystem functions including soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium are crucial for vegetation recovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem functions including soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium are crucial for vegetation recovery, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25875-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25875-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ecosystem functions including soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium are crucial for vegetation recovery&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/r1UHZ1ptL1o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>1d76b227</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Ecosystem functions including soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium are crucial for vegetation recovery</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/r1UHZ1ptL1o/s41598-018-25875-x</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1633f21a3f6:15d312:2835af05</id><crawled>1525772559350</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1525772498000</published><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25345?af=R</originId><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25345?af=R</link><author><name>AlexeyAleksandrov

In practice, the positions of the Drude particles experiencing the solvent reaction field arising from the fixed charges and induced polarization of the solute must be optimized in a self‐consistent manner. Here, we parameterized the model to reproduce experimental solvation free energies of a set of small molecules. The model reproduces well‐experimental solvation free energies of 70 molecules, yielding a root mean square difference of 0.8 kcal/mol versus 2.5 kcal/mol for the CHARMM36 additive force field. The polarization work associated with the solute transfer from the gas‐phase to the polar solvent, a term neglected in the framework of additive force fields, was found to make a large contribution to the total solvation free energy, comparable to the polar solute–solvent solvation contribution. The Drude PB/SASA also reproduces well the electronic polarization from the explicit solvent simulations of a small protein, BPTI. Model validation was based on comparisons with the experimental relative binding free energies of 371 single alanine mutations. With the Drude PB/SASA model the root mean square deviation between the predicted and experimental relative binding free energies is 3.35 kcal/mol, lower than 5.11 kcal/mol computed with the CHARMM36 additive force field.

Lipids are important structural and functional components of the skin. Alterations in the lipid composition of the epidermis are associated with inflammation and can affect the barrier function of the skin. SHARPIN-deficient &lt;i&gt;cpdm&lt;/i&gt; mice develop a chronic dermatitis with similarities to atopic dermatitis in humans. Here, we used a recently-developed approach named multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling and single ion monitoring to rapidly identify discriminative lipid ions. Shorter fatty acyl residues and increased relative amounts of sphingosine ceramides were observed in &lt;i&gt;cpdm&lt;/i&gt; epidermis compared to wild type mice. These changes were accompanied by downregulation of the &lt;i&gt;Fasn&lt;/i&gt; gene which encodes fatty acid synthase. A profile of diverse lipids was generated by fast screening of over 300 transitions (ion pairs). Tentative attribution of the most significant transitions was confirmed by product ion scan (MS/MS), and the MRM-profiling linear intensity response was validated with a C17-ceramide lipid standard. Relative quantification of sphingosine ceramides CerAS(d18:1/24:0)2OH, CerAS(d18:1/16:0)2OH and CerNS(d18:1/16:0) discriminated between the two groups with 100% accuracy, while the free fatty acids cerotic acid, 16-hydroxy palmitic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had 96.4% of accuracy. Validation by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the above-mentioned ceramides was in agreement with MRM-profiling results. Identification and rapid monitoring of these lipids represent a tool to assess therapeutic outcomes in SHARPIN-deficient mice and other mouse models of dermatitis and may have diagnostic utility in atopic dermatitis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jackeline Franco, Christina Ferreira, Tiago J.

Identification and rapid monitoring of these lipids represent a tool to assess therapeutic outcomes in SHARPIN-deficient mice and other mouse models of dermatitis and may have diagnostic utility in atopic dermatitis.</description><fingerprint>32b19ba6</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Profiling of epidermal lipids in a mouse model of dermatitis: Identification of potential biomarkers</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196595</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3afc:5785ab88</id><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><updated>1525381200000</updated><published>1525381200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197121</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197121</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197121</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Liviu Badea</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Liviu Badea, Mihaela Onu, Tao Wu, Adina Roceanu, Ovidiu Bajenaru&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liviu Badea, Mihaela Onu, Tao Wu, Adina Roceanu, Ovidiu Bajenaru&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>125c0fc5</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Exploring the reproducibility of functional connectivity alterations in Parkinson&apos;s disease</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197121</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_163186e13b7:723d2:a96d255</id><crawled>1525123257271</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166/20180430/images/medium/mp-2017-01166a_0008.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>194</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1525060800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Takashi Nakamura, Koharu Yamada, Yuki Fujiwara, Yusuke Sato, Hideyoshi Harashima</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166/20180430/images/medium/mp-2017-01166a_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The preference-performance hypothesis states that ovipositing phytophagous insects will select host plants that are well-suited for their offspring and avoid host plants that do not support offspring performance (survival, development and fitness). The mountain pine beetle (&lt;i&gt;Dendroctonus ponderosae&lt;/i&gt;), a native insect herbivore in western North America, can successfully attack and reproduce in most species of &lt;i&gt;Pinus&lt;/i&gt; throughout its native range. However, mountain pine beetles avoid attacking Great Basin bristlecone pine (&lt;i&gt;Pinus longaeva&lt;/i&gt;), despite recent climate-driven increases in mountain pine beetle populations at the high elevations where Great Basin bristlecone pine grows. Low preference for a potential host plant species may not persist if the plant supports favorable insect offspring performance, and Great Basin bristlecone pine suitability for mountain pine beetle offspring performance is unclear. We infested cut bolts of Great Basin bristlecone pine and two susceptible host tree species, limber (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexilis&lt;/i&gt;) and lodgepole (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;contorta&lt;/i&gt;) pines with adult mountain pine beetles and compared offspring performance. To investigate the potential for variation in offspring performance among mountain pine beetles from different areas, we tested beetles from geographically-separated populations within and outside the current range of Great Basin bristlecone pine. Although mountain pine beetles constructed galleries and laid viable eggs in all three tree species, extremely few offspring emerged from Great Basin bristlecone pine, regardless of the beetle population. Our observed low offspring performance in Great Basin bristlecone pine corresponds with previously documented low mountain pine beetle attack preference. A low preference-low performance relationship suggests that Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle is likely to be retained through climate-driven high-elevation mountain pine beetle outbreaks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erika L.

&lt;i&gt;Grapevine Pinot gris virus&lt;/i&gt; (GPGV) is a widely distributed grapevine pathogen that has been associated to the grapevine leaf mottling and deformation disease. With the aim of better understanding the disease epidemiology and providing efficient control strategies a specific and quantitative duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay has been developed. This method has allowed reliable quantitation of the GPGV titer ranging from 30 up to 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; transcript copies, with a detection limit of 70 viral copies in plant material. The assay targets a grapevine internal control that reduces the occurrence of false negative results, thus increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of the technique. Viral isolates both associated and non-associated to symptoms from Greece, Slovakia and Spain have been successfully detected. The method has also been applied to the absolute quantitation of GPGV in its putative transmission vector &lt;i&gt;Colomerus vitis&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the viral titer present in single mites has been determined. In addition, in the current study a new polymorphism in the GPGV genome responsible for a shorter movement protein has been found. A phylogenetic study based on this genomic region has shown a high variability among Spanish isolates and points to a different evolutionary origin of this new polymorphism. The methodology here developed opens new possibilities for basic and epidemiological studies as well as for the establishment of efficient control strategies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Félix Morán, Antonio Olmos, Leonidas Lotos, Lukáš Predajňa, Nikolaos Katis, Miroslav Glasa, Varvara Maliogka, Ana B.

Adult height is determined by both genetic characteristics and environmental factors in early life. Although previous studies have suggested that adult height is associated with risk of mortality, comprehensive associations between height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Japanese population are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the associations between adult height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among Japanese men and women in a prospective cohort study. We investigated 107,794 participants (50,755 men and 57,039 women) aged 40 to 69 years who responded to the baseline questionnaire in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Participants were classified by quartile of adult height obtained from a self-reported questionnaire in men (&amp;lt;160cm, 160-163cm, 164-167cm, ≥168cm) and women (&amp;lt;149cm, 149-151cm, 152-155cm, ≥156cm). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality from all-cause, cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other cause mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 12,320 men and 7,030 women died. Taller adult height was associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.69–0.99); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.90–0.99)) and respiratory disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.69–1.03); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.87–0.97)), but was also associated with increased risk for overall cancer mortality (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.17 (1.07–1.28); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.04 (1.01–1.07)) in men.

The leukocyte chemosensory pathway detects attractant gradients and directs cell migration to sites of inflammation, infection, tissue damage, and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have revealed that local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signals at the leading edge of polarized leukocytes play central roles in positive feedback loop essential to cell polarization and chemotaxis. These prior studies showed that stimulation of the leading edge Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal can strongly activate PI3K, thereby triggering a larger PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signal, but did not elucidate the mechanistic link between Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signaling. A hypothesis explaining this link emerged, postulating that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated PKC displaces the MARCKS protein from plasma membrane PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby releasing sequestered PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to serve as the target and substrate lipid of PI3K in PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; single molecule studies of the reconstituted pathway on lipid bilayers demonstrated the feasibility of this PKC-MARCKS-PI3K regulatory module linking Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signals in the reconstituted system. The present study tests the model predictions in live macrophages by quantifying the effects of: (a) two pathway activators—PDGF and ATP that stimulate chemoreceptors and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, respectively; and (b) three pathway inhibitors—wortmannin, EGTA, and Go6976 that inhibit PI3K, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, and PKC, respectively; on (c) four leading edge activity sensors—AKT-PH-mRFP, CKAR, MARCKSp-mRFP, and leading edge area that report on PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; density, PKC activity, MARCKS membrane binding, and leading edge expansion/contraction, respectively. The results provide additional evidence that PKC and PI3K are both essential elements of the leading edge positive feedback loop, and strongly support the existence of a PKC-MARCKS-PI3K regulatory module linking the leading edge Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signals. As predicted, activators stimulate leading edge PKC activity, displacement of MARCKS from the leading edge membrane and increased leading edge PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; levels, while inhibitors trigger the opposite effects. Comparison of the findings for the ameboid chemotaxis of leukocytes with recently published findings for the mesenchymal chemotaxis of fibroblasts suggests that some features of the emerging leukocyte leading edge core pathway (PLC-DAG-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-PKC-MARCKS-PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PI3K-PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) may well be shared by all chemotaxing eukaryotic cells, while other elements of the leukocyte pathway may be specialized features of these highly optimized, professional gradient-seeking cells. More broadly, the findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the strong links between phospho-MARCKS and many human cancers.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian P.

Here, we present a free, libre and open-source package, babette: &amp;quot;BEAUti 2, BEAST2 and Tracer for R&amp;quot;, for the R programming language. babette creates BEAST2 input files, runs BEAST2 and parses its results, all from an R function call. We describe babette&apos;s usage and the novel functionality it provides compared to the original tools and give some examples. As babette is designed to be of high quality and extendable, we conclude by describing the further development of the package.</description><fingerprint>5cf5a43d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>babette: BEAUti 2, BEAST2 and Tracer for R [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271866v5?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162ff2817fb:7f75de:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1524699240443</crawled><published>1524639600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/307959v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/25/307959</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/307959v1?rss=1</originId><engagement>28</engagement><author><name>Bermeister, K.

The aim of this study was to compare the axial lengths (ALs) using a new biometer with swept-source optical coherence tomography (Argos) versus ALs using a conventional biometer with partial coherence interferometry (IOL Master, version 5). The ALs in 48 eyes of 48 cataract patients were measured with Argos using refractive indexes that correspond to the particular tissue and with IOL Master using a single refractive index. The eyes were divided into three subgroups by AL length: short-AL group (n = 16), &amp;lt;23.27 mm; intermediate-AL group (n = 16), 23.27–24.03 mm; long-AL group (n = 16), ≥24.04 mm. The ALs (mm) measured with the Argos and IOL Master biometers, respectively, were 22.77 ± 0.43 and 22.74 ± 0.44, 23.63 ± 0.21 and 23.62 ± 0.21, and 26.00 ± 1.61 and 26.05 ± 1.64 in the short-, intermediate-, and long-AL groups, respectively. The mean ALs with the Argos biometer were longer than those with the IOL Master biometer in the short-AL group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) There was no significant difference in the intermediate-AL groups (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14). In contrast, the mean ALs with the Argos biometer were shorter than those with the IOL Master biometer in the long-AL group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Differences between the ALs measured with the two biometers were statistically significant in short- and long-AL subgroups. However, the differences might not be clinically significant.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoaki Higashiyama, Hazuki Mori, Fumi Nakajima, Masahito Ohji&lt;/p&gt;

Organic chemists like what it can do (cyclopropane formation, cycloadditions, fast, clean methyl ester formation, etc.), but the compound itself is very hard to have warm feelings for. It’s unstable on storage, and thus has to be prepared fresh. That preparation is fairly tedious, and you have to pay close attention to what you’re doing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/04/30/how_not_to_do_it_diazomethane&quot;&gt;unlike this guy&lt;/a&gt;), because the diazomethane product can and will decompose violently (and even explode) if you mishandle it. “Mishandle” includes, but is not limited to, making it too concentrated, exposing it to friction or rough surfaces, the presence of metals, etc. It’s also quite volatile and very toxic, explosions aside. That goes even for the less explosive form, trimethylsilyldiazomethane, which is stable enough to be an article of commerce but which is sadly &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/05/14/tms_diazomethane_update_on_a_fatality&quot;&gt;just as deadly&lt;/a&gt; as the original item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would explain why you don’t see an awful lot of plain diazo compounds in the literature. The stabilized ones like ethyl diazoacetate are pretty common, but when’s the last time you heard about diazopropane? Or cyclopropyldiazomethane? Right, probably never, and that’s largely because the higher diazos, being less volatile, are no fun to prepare because you can’t distill them over in ether like you can the parent compound. By the time you’ve purified them, there’s not much left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201802092?af=R&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt;, though, could change that. A group at Montréal has adapted a solution-phase prep (silver oxide and potassium carbonate) to flow chemistry, which is the natural home for these kinds of compounds. (&lt;em&gt;Update: see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.201710445&quot;&gt;this recent paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Ley group – another flow approach&lt;/em&gt;). Running hydrazones in dichloromethane through a column of these reagents (mixed with Celite) gives you diazo compounds out the other end. But you can tell that these are lively compounds – when they tried this on acetone hydrazone at room temperature, they got a colorless stream and plenty of gas bubbles, because the 2-diazopropane had already decomposed. Lowering the temperature to -20C and cranking up the flow rate, though, gave a red solution which is the real thing, ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used this setup to produce a whole range of basically unknown diazo compounds (they’re yellow, orange, red, and purple in solution), and took them directly into esterification, cycloaddition, and cyclopropanation reactions. You’re not going to let these things sit around; unstabilized diazo formation is going to be an on-demand process no matter how it’s done. But it looks like these compounds are now open to experimentation in a way that they’ve never been before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>I don’t think that anyone really likes diazomethane.

A group at Merck (Boston) reports a combination of very small-scale automated synthesis with a screening assay in situ (no purification). You may be wondering how that works, or how it can possibly work, especially when you hear that the nanoscale reactions are transition-metal catalyzed. After all, we usually spend a good deal of effort trying to make sure that our assay candidates are cleaned up and (most especially) free of metal contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is the type of protein assay. It’s not a functional readout, which is where the metals can give you all sorts of false positives, but rather just a binding assay, done by mass spec. That’s generally done in an is-anything-there binary mode, but in this paper, they’re actually titrating in the amount of protein to get a rough order of affinities. Still, one strike against that sort of detection has always been “But you’re only measuring binding, not real inhibition, etc.” That’s still true, but now you can always consider going the targeted protein degradation route, in which case all you need is some sort of binder. As mentioned here in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/26/dna-libraries-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;another recent post&lt;/a&gt;, the same consideration applies to DNA-encoded libraries, which also just give you a binding affinity readout – the Merck authors don’t mention this aspect, but it’s a real consideration these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, they did a test with 20 reactions each using amide formation, Suzuki couplings, and Buchwald-Hartwig C-N couplings (which certainly cover a lot of real-world medicinal chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/24/boring-or-the-medicinal-chemists-toolkit&quot;&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;).  They used the small-scale reaction setup to screen conditions for the latter two, in a smaller-scale version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. In each case, they also synthesized the products on a 20mg scale and purified them by traditional means, in order to compare them with the nanoscale assay results. (These all produced compounds in known kinase inhibitor space, which I’m afraid is also pretty realistic.) And the correlation was strong: the affinity-mass-spec assay could indeed pick out the potent compounds (as it should) without giving false positives along the way (since you’re looking for the particular mass signature of the product associated with the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this confirmation in hand, the group then took one of the intermediates and coupled it in each individual well of a 384 plate after an automated reaction conditions screen. They got 345 products and rank-ordered them by titrating in CHK1 protein, with a mass spec readout each time, and identified three new potent binders. These reactions are done on about 0.05mg of material each, so you can plow through quite a few of them without plowing through a lot of starting material, and generate a lot of SAR data rather quickly. The reaction screening is a key part of the process – taking robust but generic coupling conditions across that same 384 set only gave 158 products (and thus missed several nanomolar inhibitors). Overall, to optimize the 384 set and assay them took 3114 reactions, consuming about 120mg of the starting material. You are not going to be able to do that by hand. I don’t care how much of a machine you are in the lab, you’re not more of a machine than a machine is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, machine-learning algorithms may eventually make it easier to navigate both reaction condition space and SAR space, but for now, we really have to attack these things empirically, and this (in general) seems like the way to do it. Small scale, highly automated, optimized, high-throughput: you’re not going to be able to sort things so thoroughly any other way. And since we often have to resort to brute force, we should be letting the machines take that on whenever possible, because brute force is exactly what they do the best. That was proven on the high-throughput screening end of the business many years ago, and it’s true on the compound synthesis end of things, too. Bring ’em on.&lt;/p&gt;

Perinatal depression is common, and left untreated can have significant and long-lasting consequences for women, their children and their families. Migrant women are at particular risk of perinatal depression as a result of a multitude of stressors experienced before, during and after migration. Identification of perinatal depression among migrant women—particularly those living in low- and middle-income regions—remains challenging, partly due to the lack of locally-validated and culturally appropriate screens tools. This study formally validates Burmese and Sgaw Karen versions of the &lt;i&gt;Refugee Health Screener-15&lt;/i&gt; (RHS-15) as a screening tool for perinatal depression among migrant women living on the Thai-Myanmar border. The &lt;i&gt;Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of DSM-IV Disorders&lt;/i&gt; (SCID) was used as the gold-standard comparator. Complete results were obtained for 235 Burmese-speaking and 275 Sgaw Karen-speaking women. Despite displaying reasonable psychometric properties, a number of shortcomings associated with the RHS-15 limited its utility in this setting. The Likert-type response categories of the RHS-15 proved problematic in this low-literacy population. Combined with the relative superiority and greater ease of administration of the SCID, the RHS-15 is not recommended as the tool of choice for detecting perinatal depression in this setting.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gracia Fellmeth, Emma Plugge, Mina Fazel, Prakaykaew Charunwattana, François Nosten, Raymond Fitzpatrick, Julie A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Calcifications within the hippocampus were recently described for the first time on computed tomography (CT). These calcifications appeared in patients older than 50 years, the prevalence increases with age and they may be associated with cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the histological basis (the presence, severity and location) of these CT-detected hippocampal calcifications of post-mortem brains.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;CT scans of seven post-mortem brains were scored for the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of hippocampal calcification. After this, samples from nine hippocampi (bilateral in two brains, unilateral in five brains) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to indicate the cytoarchitecture, with Elastica van Gieson to analyse the elastic connective tissue of the vessel walls and with von Kossa for detection of calcium.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In four brains (six hippocampi), calcifications were both found on CT and in corresponding histology. In three brains (three hippocampi), calcifications were absent on CT and corresponding histology. In histology, mild calcifications were located in the tail and severe calcifications involved the tail, body and sometimes the head of the hippocampus. The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa E.

Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. It can alleviate the damage of heavy metal ions, and other chemical substances, changes in temperature and humidity, oxidative stress in higher plants, and enhance resistance of plants to abiotic stress. The transformation of N-Acetyl-5-hydroxy tryptamin into melatonin requires the involvement of methyltransferase. In this study, a methyltransferase gene &lt;i&gt;ZjOMT&lt;/i&gt; has been cloned from &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. The gene was induced by aluminum (Al) stress in the leaves and roots of &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;, and was up-regulated by 20.86- and 31.18-folds, respectively. The expression of ZjOMT in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increased the content of melatonin by about 8-fold in the recombinant strain compared with that of the empty vector strain. Al resistance test showed that the resistance of recombinant strain BL21-pET32-ZjOMT to Al was significantly higher than that of the empty vector strain BL21-pET32. The survival rate of the recombinant strain expressing ZjOMT was about 100-fold higher than that of the empty vector strain when treated with 0.35 mM Al. These findings suggest that the heterologous expression of ZjOMT improved the resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to Al by increasing the content of melatonin.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongsong Luo, Chunyan He, Liebao Han&lt;/p&gt;

Interferometric scattering mass spectrometry allows spatiotemporally resolved measurement of a broad range of biomolecular interactions, one molecule at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>4fb97889</fingerprint><keywords><item>Biochemistry, Molecular Biology</item></keywords><unread>True</unread><title>Quantitative mass imaging of single biological macromolecules</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/423?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16381f77d24:6535e38:2835af05</id><crawled>1526893870372</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26170-5/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26170_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>510</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><published>1526886000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26170-5</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26170-5</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26170-5</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>David Talavera</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26170-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26170-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/e7-eRL-hDlY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26170-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26170-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/e7-eRL-hDlY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>22cff463</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/e7-eRL-hDlY/s41598-018-26170-5</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16344cec9b8:b01c28:2835af05</id><crawled>1525867792824</crawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05093-1/d41586-018-05093-1_15744782.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><published>1525849200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05093-1</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05093-1</originId><engagement>31</engagement><author><name>Richard Hodson</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How robots are grasping the art of gripping&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How robots are grasping the art of gripping, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05093-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05093-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Humans are masters of dexterity.

From 2006 to 2013, an increasing incidence of fusariosis was observed in the hematologic patients of our University Hospital. We suspected of an environmental source, and the indoor hospital air was investigated as a potential source of the fungemia. Air samplings were performed in the hematology and bone marrow transplant (BMT) wards using an air sampler with pre-defined air volumes. To study the molecular relationship among environmental and clinical isolates, 18 &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; spp. recovered from blood cultures were included in the study. DNA sequencing of a partial portion of &lt;i&gt;TEF1α&lt;/i&gt; gene was performed for molecular identification. Molecular typing was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) using a four-gene scheme: &lt;i&gt;TEF1α&lt;/i&gt;, rDNA, &lt;i&gt;RPB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RPB2&lt;/i&gt;. One hundred four isolates were recovered from the air of the hematology (n = 76) and the BMT (n = 28) wards. &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; isolates from the air were from five species complexes: &lt;i&gt;Fusarium fujikuroi&lt;/i&gt; (FFSC, n = 56), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti&lt;/i&gt; (FIESC, n = 24), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium solani&lt;/i&gt; (FSSC, n = 13), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium chlamydosporum&lt;/i&gt; (FCSC, n = 10), and &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; (FOSC, n = 1). Fifteen &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from blood belonged to FSSC, and three to FFSC. MLST identified the same sequence type (ST) in clinical and environmental isolates. ST1 was found in 5 isolates from blood and in 7 from the air, both identified as FSSC (&lt;i&gt;Fusarium petroliphilum&lt;/i&gt;). STn1 was found in one isolate from blood and in one from the air, both identified as FFSC (&lt;i&gt;Fusarium napiforme&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;napiforme&lt;/i&gt; was isolated from the air of the hospital room of the patient with fungemia due to &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;napiforme&lt;/i&gt;. These findings suggested a possible clonal origin of the &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; spp. recovered from air and bloodcultures. In conclusion, our study found a diversity of &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species in the air of our hospital, and a possible role of the air as source of systemic fusariosis in our immunocompromised patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Luiza Moretti, Ariane Fidelis Busso-Lopes, Cibele Aparecida Tararam, Renato Moraes, Yasunori Muraosa, Yuzuru Mikami, Tohru Gonoi, Hideaki Taguchi, Luzia Lyra, Franqueline Reichert-Lima, Plínio Trabasso, Gerrit Sybren de Hoog, Abdullah Mohammed Said Al-Hatmi, Angelica Zaninelli Schreiber, Katsuhiko Kamei&lt;/p&gt;

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main products of indigestible carbohydrates that are fermented by microbiota in the hindgut. This study was designed to investigate the effects of oral SCFAs administration on the lipid metabolism of weaned pigs. A total of 21 barrows were randomly allocated into three groups, including control group (orally infused with 200 mL physiological saline per day), low dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 20.04 mM, propionic acid 7.71 mM and butyric acid 4.89 mM per day), and high dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 40.08 mM, propionic acid 15.42 mM and butyric acid 9.78 mM per day). The results showed that the average daily feed intake of SCFAs groups were lower than that of control group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Oral administration of SCFAs decreased the concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and insulin (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased the leptin concentration in serum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). The total fat, as well as TC and TG levels in liver, was decreased by oral SCFAs administration (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, SCFAs down-regulated the mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and enhanced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α) in liver (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). SCFAs also decreased FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor σ mRNA expressions in longissimus dorsi (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). And in abdominal fat, SCFAs reduced FAS and ACC mRNA expressions (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased CPT-1α mRNA expression (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). These results suggested that oral administration of SCFAs could attenuate fat deposition in weaned pigs via reducing lipogenesis and enhancing lipolysis of different tissues.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by A.

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus agalactiae&lt;/i&gt;, or group B streptococcus (GBS), is an important pathogen as it is the leading cause of neonatal deaths due to sepsis, meningitis or bacterial pneumonia. Although the development of an effective and safe GBS vaccine is on the agenda of many research labs, there is no GBS vaccine on the market yet. In the present study we attempted to engineer a live vaccine strain based on Bac, a surface protein of GBS, incorporated into a surface fimbrial protein of probiotic Enterococcus. The resulting strain induced specific systemic and local immune responses in mice and provided protection against GBS when administered via the intranasal, oral or intravaginal immunization routes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by T.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;

The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>48429c9d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>The impact of being bullied at school on psychological distress and work engagement in a community sample of adult workers in Japan</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1634619c5fc:d47db4:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525889484284</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1525888246000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaat8528?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/440/eaat8528.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaat8528?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Segal, L.

Plant leaves of different ages differ in nutrients and toxic metabolites and thus exhibit various resistance levels against insect herbivores. However, little is known about the influence of leaf ontogeny on plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects. In this study, we found that the green peach aphid, &lt;i&gt;Myzus persicae&lt;/i&gt;, preferred to settle on young cabbage leaves compared with mature or old leaves, although young leaves contained the highest concentration of glucosinolates. Furthermore, aphids feeding on young leaves had higher levels of glucosinolates in their body, but aphids performed better on young leaves in terms of body weight and population growth. Phloem sap of young leaves had higher amino acid:sugar molar ratio than mature leaves, and aphids feeding on young leaves showed two times longer phloem feeding time and five times more honeydew excretion than on other leaves. These results indicate that aphids acquired the highest amount of nutrients and defensive metabolites when feeding on young cabbage leaves that are strong natural plant sinks. Accordingly, we propose that aphids generally prefer to obtain more nutrition rather than avoiding host plant defense, and total amount of nutrition that aphids could obtain is significantly influenced by leaf ontogeny or source-sink status of feeding sites.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by He-He Cao, Zhan-Feng Zhang, Xiao-Feng Wang, Tong-Xian Liu&lt;/p&gt;

To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and Large White sows (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In addition, the serological concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were not significantly different between the two breeds at the 3rd week postpartum. However, these indicators were significantly different at the 5th week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.000, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, respectively). The SIgA concentrations in saliva were significantly different between breeds at the 3rd week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In conclusion, both breeds of sows maybe in a state of stress after the 4th week postpartum.

Tuberculosis (TB) in animals is a re-emerging disease with a wide range of hosts that causes large economic losses in livestock. Goats are particularly susceptible to TB and, in endemic areas, vaccination may be a valuable measure to control the disease. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of parenteral vaccination of goats with a heat-inactivated &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&lt;/i&gt; (HIMB) vaccine, and compare it to M. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Twenty-four goat kids were divided in 3 groups as following: HIMB vaccinated group (n = 8), BCG vaccinated group (n = 8) and unvaccinated group (n = 8). Afterwards, goats were experimentally challenged with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium caprae&lt;/i&gt; by the endobronchial route. Antigen specific interferon-γ release assays and serology were performed after vaccination and challenge. Pathological and bacteriological parameters were evaluated after necropsy at 9 weeks post-challenge (p.c.). HIMB vaccine showed similar levels of protection to BCG in terms of volume reduction of thoracic TB lesions, presence of extra-pulmonary lesions, as well as a slight reduction of bacterial load in pulmonary lymph nodes. Moreover, HIMB vaccine did not induce interferences on the interferon-γ release assay based on reagents previously developed to differentiate infected from BCG vaccinated individuals. The results indicate that HIMB is a suitable vaccine candidate for further larger-scale trials under field conditions in goats.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudia Arrieta-Villegas, Tania Perálvarez, Enric Vidal, Zoë Puighibet, Xavier Moll, Albert Canturri, Iker A.

AlH3(NMe3). ALD film growth experiments using TiCl4 and AlH2(tBuNCH2CH2NMe2) produced titanium carbonitride films with a high
growth rate of 1.6-2.0 Å/cycle and resistivities around 600 μΩ·cm within a very
wide ALD window of 220-400 °C. Importantly, film growth proceeded via
self-limited surface reactions, which is the hallmark of an ALD process. Root
mean square surface roughness was only 1.3 % of the film thickness at 300 °C by
atomic force microscopy. The films were polycrystalline with low intensity, broad
reflections corresponding to the cubic TiN/TiC phase according to grazing
incidence X-ray diffraction. Film composition by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy was approximately TiC0.8N0.5 at 300 °C with
small amounts of Al (6 at%), Cl (4 at%) and O (4 at%) impurities. Remarkably,
self-limited growth and low Al content was observed in films deposited well
above the solid-state thermal decomposition point of AlH2(tBuNCH2CH2NMe2), which is ca. 185 °C. Similar growth rates,
resistivities, and film compositions were observed in ALD film growth trials

Women’s groups practicing participatory learning and action (PLA) in rural areas have been shown to improve maternal and newborn survival in low-income countries, but the pathways from intervention to impact remain unclear. We assessed the long-term impact of a PLA intervention in rural Nepal on women’s agency in the household. In 2014, we conducted a follow-up study to a cluster randomised controlled trial on the impact of PLA women’s groups from 2001–2003. Agency was measured using the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) and its subdomains. Multi-level regression analyses were performed adjusting for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. We additionally adjusted for potential exposure to subsequent PLA groups based on women’s pregnancy status and conduct of PLA groups in areas of residence. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two alternative measures of agency. We analysed outcomes for 4030 mothers (66% of the cohort) who survived and were recruited to follow-up at mean age 39.6 years. Across a wide range of model specifications, we found no association between exposure to the original PLA intervention with women’s agency in the household approximately 11.5 years later. Subsequent exposure to PLA groups was not associated with greater agency in the household at follow-up, but some specifications found evidence for reduced agency. Household agency may be a prerequisite for actualising the benefits of PLA groups rather than a consequence.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lu Gram, Jolene Skordis-Worrall, Dharma S.

Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors.

Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>423e28bc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>VEGF-neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP {beta}2-chimaerin</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/528/eaao6897?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1634444e071:9c5458:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525858754673</crawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05096-y/d41586-018-05096-y_15738964.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><published>1525849200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y</originId><engagement>33</engagement><author><name>Lisa Randall</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Is Dark Matter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Is Dark Matter?, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05096-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An elusive substance that permeates the universe exerts many detectable gravitational influences yet eludes direct detection.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Is Dark Matter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Is Dark Matter?, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05096-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An elusive substance that permeates the universe exerts many detectable gravitational influences yet eludes direct detection.</description><fingerprint>de0681ff</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>What Is Dark Matter?</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05096-y</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1631d0aa071:2800c75:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1525200625777</crawled><published>1525158000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/257683v2?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/01/257683</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/257683v2?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Daly, A.

Bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) is a widely-performed procedure in orthognathic surgery for the correction of dentofacial deformity. Condylar positioning is a critical step during BSSO to maximize functional and morphological results. The unsuitable positioning of condyles represents one of the causative mechanisms that may induce temporomandibular joint noxious effects after BSSO. Repositioning devices can assist surgeons in maintaining the preoperative condylar position; however, empirical repositioning methods based on experience gained are still commonly used. Trainee learning curves are difficult to assess. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relevance of computer-assisted surgery in the acquisition of condylar positioning skills. Forty-eight patients underwent BSSO performed by six maxillofacial trainees (four junior residents and two senior experienced residents). A condyle positioning system (CPS) was used by a senior surgeon to record a condylar position score during the procedure. Firstly, scores were recorded when the trainee manually positioned the condyle without access to the CPS score (phase 1) and then when the trainee positioned the condyle and performed osteosynthesis with visual access to the CPS score (phase 2). Six parameters describing condylar three-dimensional motions were assessed: translational motion from top to bottom (TB), back to front (BF), and left to right (LR), axial rotation (AR), sagittal rotation (SR), frontal rotation (FR), and a total score (TS). There were no significant differences between junior and senior residents in condyle positioning without access to the CPS. Condyles were significantly better positioned during phase 2 with access to the CPS (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Over time, use of the CPS (phase 2) produced significantly quicker improvements in scores (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.042). For those teaching surgeries to trainees, computer-assisted devices can potentially result in more rapid learning curves than traditional “observations-imitation” models. Use of a CPS by trainees facilitated condylar repositioning that resulted in an accurate occlusal result and avoidance of adverse effects on the temporomandibular joint.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charles Savoldelli, Emmanuel Chamorey, Georges Bettega&lt;/p&gt;

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

NKp46, a natural killer (NK) cell–activating receptor, is involved in NK cell cytotoxicity against virus-infected cells or tumor cells. However, the role of NKp46 in other NKp46&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; non-NK innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations has not yet been characterized. Here, an NKp46 deficiency model of natural cytotoxicity receptor 1 (&lt;i&gt;Ncr1&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;gfp/gfp&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ncr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;gfp/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, i.e., homozygous and heterozygous knockout (KO), was used to explore the role of NKp46 in regulating the development of the NKp46&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILCs. Surprisingly, our studies demonstrated that homozygous NKp46 deficiency resulted in a nearly complete depletion of the ILC1 subset (ILC1) of group 1 ILCs, and heterozygote KO decreased the number of cells in the ILC1 subset. Moreover, transplantation studies confirmed that ILC1 development depends on NKp46 and that the dependency is cell intrinsic. Interestingly, however, the cell depletion specifically occurred in the ILC1 subset but not in the other ILCs, including ILC2s, ILC3s, and NK cells. Thus, our studies reveal that NKp46 selectively participates in the regulation of ILC1 development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oHgr98r15pw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yufeng Wang, Wenjuan Dong, Yibo Zhang, Michael A.

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cuiying Song, Wei Guan, Jihui Ma&lt;/p&gt;

The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</description><fingerprint>b8b45692</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Potential travel cost saving in urban public-transport networks using smartphone guidance</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197181</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16318a22675:2181a41:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1525126669941</crawled><published>1525158000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25426-4</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25426-4</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25426-4</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>El-Hadj Bâ</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Implementation, coverage and equity of large-scale door-to-door delivery of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) to children under 10 in Senegal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Implementation, coverage and equity of large-scale door-to-door delivery of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) to children under 10 in Senegal, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25426-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25426-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Implementation, coverage and equity of large-scale door-to-door delivery of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) to children under 10 in Senegal&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/HR-yvf6OTno&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Implementation, coverage and equity of large-scale door-to-door delivery of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) to children under 10 in Senegal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Implementation, coverage and equity of large-scale door-to-door delivery of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) to children under 10 in Senegal, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25426-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25426-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Implementation, coverage and equity of large-scale door-to-door delivery of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) to children under 10 in Senegal&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/HR-yvf6OTno&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>8d96e99d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Author Correction: Implementation, coverage and equity of large-scale door-to-door delivery of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) to children under 10 in Senegal</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/HR-yvf6OTno/s41598-018-25426-4</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162fc1cab9f:27b9d5:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1524648160159</crawled><published>1524639600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04044-8</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04044-8</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04044-8</originId><engagement>126</engagement><author><name>Matthieu P.M.H.

Urban economies are composed of diverse activities, embodied in labor occupations, which depend on one another to produce goods and services. Yet little is known about how the nature and intensity of these interdependences change as cities increase in population size and economic complexity. Understanding the relationship between occupational interdependencies and the number of occupations defining an urban economy is relevant because interdependence within a networked system has implications for system resilience and for how easily can the structure of the network be modified. Here, we represent the interdependencies among occupations in a city as a non-spatial information network, where the strengths of interdependence between pairs of occupations determine the strengths of the links in the network. Using those quantified link strengths we calculate a single metric of interdependence–or connectedness–which is equivalent to the density of a city’s weighted occupational network. We then examine urban systems in six industrialized countries, analyzing how the density of urban occupational networks changes with network size, measured as the number of unique occupations present in an urban workforce. We find that in all six countries, density, or economic interdependence, increases superlinearly with the number of distinct occupations. Because connections among occupations represent flows of information, we provide evidence that connectivity scales superlinearly with network size in information networks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shade T.

The polymorphisms at the α-chain of the IL-7 receptor (&lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt;) have been related to T-cell homeostasis and development and may contribute to immune system deregulation. In the present study, we analyzed the association between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms and the progression of liver fibrosis in patients infected with HCV. We carried out a retrospective study with a design consisting of repeated measurements in 187 HCV-infected patients, to study the risk prediction of liver fibrosis progression using genetic factors. We genotyped the rs6897932, rs987106 and rs3194051 &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms using the Agena Bioscience’s MassARRAY. Transient elastography was used to measure liver stiffness. The used cut-offs were: &amp;lt;7.1 kPa (F0-F1), 7.1–9.4 kPa (F2; significant fibrosis), 9.5-12.4 kPa (F3; advanced fibrosis), and ≥12.5 kPa (F4; cirrhosis). All HCV genotypes were analyzed. The median of follow-up time was 47.9 months. Baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values did not show significant statistical differences for &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes (p&gt;0.05). In univariate analysis, the rs6897932 T allele had a positive relationship with an increase in LSM (arithmetic mean ratio (AMR) = 1.21 (95%CI = 1.08; 1.36); p = 0.001), progression to advanced fibrosis (F≥3) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51 (95%CI = 1.29; 4.88); p = 0.006) and progression to cirrhosis (F4) (OR = 2.71 (95%CI = 0.94; 5.03); p = 0.069). In multivariable analysis, the rs6897932 T allele was related to a higher increase of LSM values during follow-up (adjusted AMR = 1.27 (95%CI = 1.13; 1.42); p&amp;lt;0.001) and higher odds of progression to advanced fibrosis [adjusted OR = 4.46 (95%CI = 1.87; 10.62); p = 0.001], and progression to cirrhosis [adjusted OR = 3.92 (95%CI = 1.30; 11.77); p = 0.015]. Regarding &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and rs3194051 polymorphisms, we did not find significant results except for the relationship between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and the increase in LSM values [adjusted OR = 1.12 (95%CI = 1.02; 1.23); p = 0.015]. The &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs6897932 polymorphism seems to be related to increased risk of liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected patients.

Background &lt;p&gt;In airway epithelium, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22) are induced by defective epithelial barriers such as E-cadherin and attract the effector cells of Th2 immunity. However, the association between the epithelial barrier and CCL17 expression has not been studied in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CCL17 and its regulation by Th cytokines in nasal polyp (NP) epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The expression and distribution of CCL17, CCL22, E-cadherin and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were measured using real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry and compared between normal ethmoid sinus epithelium and NP epithelium. In addition, the expression level of CCL17 was determined in cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The expression of CCL17 was decreased in the NP epithelium compared to the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus, whereas the expression of CCL22 was not decreased. E-cadherin was differentially distributed between the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus and NP epithelium. EGFR was also decreased in NPs. Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byoungjae Kim, Hyun-Ji Lee, Nu-Ri Im, Doh Young Lee, Ha Kyun Kim, Cha Young Kang, Il-Ho Park, Seung Hoon Lee, Heung-Man Lee, Sang Hag Lee, Seung-Kuk Baek, Tae Hoon Kim&lt;/p&gt;

The link between athlete physique and performance in sports is well established. However, a direct link between somatotype three-numeral rating and anaerobic performance has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the relations between somatotype and anaerobic performance using both singular and multivariate analyses. Thirty-six physically active males (mean ± standard deviation age 26.0 ± 9.8 years; body mass 79.5 ± 12.9 kg; height 1.82 ± 0.07 m) were somatotype-rated using the Heath-Carter method. Subjects were assessed for 3 repetition maximum (3 RM) bench press and back squat, and completed a 30-second maximal sprint cycle test. Positive correlations were observed between mesomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = 0.560, p &amp;lt; 0.001), mesomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = 0.550, p = 0.001) and between mesomorphy and minimum power output (r = 0.357, p = 0.033). Negative correlations were observed between ectomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = -0.381, p = 0.022), and ectomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = -0.336, p = 0.045). Individual regression analysis indicated that mesomorphy was the best predictor of 3 RM bench press performance, with 31.4% of variance in 3 RM bench press performance accounted for by the mesomorphy rating (p &amp;lt; 0.001). A combination of mesomorphy and ectomorphy best predicted 3 RM back squat performance (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.388, p &amp;lt; 0.04). Around one third of strength performance is predicted by somatotype-assessed physique in physically active males. This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Helen Ryan-Stewart, James Faulkner, Simon Jobson&lt;/p&gt;

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates genes in many physiological pathways by binding to enhancer and silencer elements of target genes, where it recruits coregulator proteins that remodel chromatin and regulate the assembly of transcription complexes. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is necessary for glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of one group of GR target genes, is irrelevant for a second group, and inhibits GR binding to a third gene set, thereby blocking their regulation by GC. Gene-specific characteristics that distinguish GR binding regions (GBR) at Hic-5 blocked genes from GBR at other GC-regulated genes are unknown. Here we show genome-wide that blocked GBR generally require CHD9 and BRM for GR occupancy in contrast to GBR that are not blocked by Hic-5. Hic-5 blocked GBR are enriched near Hic-5 blocked GR target genes but not near GR target genes that are not blocked by Hic-5. Furthermore blocked GBR are in a closed conformation prior to Hic-5 depletion, and require Hic-5 depletion and glucocorticoid treatment to create an open conformation necessary for GR occupancy. A transcription factor binding motif characteristic of the ETS family was enriched near blocked GBR and blocked genes but not near non-blocked GBR or non-blocked GR target genes. Thus, we identify specific differences in chromatin conformation, chromatin remodeler requirements, and local DNA sequence motifs that contribute to gene-specific actions of transcription factors and coregulators. These findings shed light on mechanisms that contribute to binding site selection by transcription factors, which vary in a cell type-specific manner.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian H.

Thus, we identify specific differences in chromatin conformation, chromatin remodeler requirements, and local DNA sequence motifs that contribute to gene-specific actions of transcription factors and coregulators. These findings shed light on mechanisms that contribute to binding site selection by transcription factors, which vary in a cell type-specific manner.</description><fingerprint>d9a86db1</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Different chromatin and DNA sequence characteristics define glucocorticoid receptor binding sites that are blocked or not blocked by coregulator Hic-5</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba8:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><updated>1524517200000</updated><published>1524517200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Teppei Nakamura</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Teppei Nakamura, Masataka Chihara, Osamu Ichii, Saori Otsuka-Kanazawa, Ken-ichi Nagasaki, Yaser Hosny Ali Elewa, Osamu Tatsumi, Yasuhiro Kon&lt;/p&gt;
MRL/MpJ mice have abundant ovarian mast cells (MCs) as compared with other strains at postnatal day 0 (P0); however, they sharply decrease after birth. These ovarian MCs, particularly beneath the ovarian surface epithelium (SE), which express mucosal MC (MMC) marker, might participate in early follicular development. This study investigated the changes in spatiotemporal distribution of MCs in the perinatal MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. At P0 to P7, the MCs were densely localized to the ovary, especially their caudomedial region around the ovary-fimbria connection. The neonatal ovarian MCs showed intermediate characteristics of MMC and connective tissue MC (CTMC), and the latter phenotype became evident with aging. However, the expression ratio of the MMC to CTMC marker increased from P0 to P4 in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovary. Similarly, the ratio of MCs facing SE to total MC number increased with aging, although the number of ovarian MCs decreased, indicating the relative increase in MMC phenotypes in the early neonatal ovary. Neither proliferating nor apoptotic MCs were found in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. The parenchymal cells surrounding MCs at ovary-fimbria connection showed similar molecular expression patterns (E-cadherin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Foxl2&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/Gata4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as that of the ovarian surface epithelial cells. At P2, around the ovary-fimbria connection, c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; immature oocytes formed clusters called nests, and some MCs localized adjacent to c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; oocytes within the nests. These results indicated that in postnatal MRL/MpJ mice, ovarian MCs changed their distribution by migrating toward the parenchymal cells composing ovary-fimbria connection, which possessed similar characteristics to the ovarian surface epithelium. Thus, we elucidated the spatiotemporal alterations of the ovarian MCs in MRL/MpJ mice, and suggested their importance during the early follicular development by migrating toward the ovary-fimbria connection. MRL/MpJ mice would be useful to elucidate the relationship between neonatal immunity and reproductive systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Teppei Nakamura, Masataka Chihara, Osamu Ichii, Saori Otsuka-Kanazawa, Ken-ichi Nagasaki, Yaser Hosny Ali Elewa, Osamu Tatsumi, Yasuhiro Kon&lt;/p&gt;

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the nationwide seasonal peaks, risk factors, and utilization of medical resources of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;A Taiwan nationwide birth cohort was extracted from the Birth Certificate Application Database during 2007–2009 and prospectively linked to the National Health Insurance database. We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29–35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants without BPD born at &amp;lt; 32 wGA had higher RSVH rate than those born at 33–35 wGA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Overall, 56.4% of RSVH occurred within 9 months of CA. Preterm infants with BPD had significantly higher ICU admission rate within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), MV usage within 12 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and LOS within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) than those without BPD.

Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals’ decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animal’s behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. We applied this framework to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, fed worms prefer, while starved worms avoid the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative and that their behavior involved two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). With DM, worms efficiently reached specific temperatures, which explains their thermotactic behavior when fed. With IM, worms moved along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking, well-observed in previous studies. In contrast to fed animals, starved worms escaped the cultivation temperature using only the absolute, but not the temporal derivative of temperature. We also investigated the neural basis underlying these strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. Thus, our IRL-based approach is useful in identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and could be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making, in other organisms.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kL4dFBBuUp4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shoichiro Yamaguchi, Honda Naoki, Muneki Ikeda, Yuki Tsukada, Shunji Nakano, Ikue Mori, Shin Ishii&lt;/p&gt;

The effects of age on neophobia and exploration are best described in birds and primates, and broader comparisons require reports from other taxa. Here we present data showing age-dependent exploration in a long-lived social species, the common vampire bat (&lt;i&gt;Desmodus rotundus&lt;/i&gt;). A previous study found that vampire bats regurgitated food to partners trapped in a cage. Interestingly, while only a few adult bats visited the trapped bat, in every trial all or most of the eight young males in the colony would visit the trapped bat without feeding it. To test whether this behavioral difference resulted from age class differences in exploration, we compared responses of the bats to a trapped conspecific versus an inanimate novel object. Some adults and young showed interest in trapped conspecifics, but only the young males explored the novel objects. Additional novel object tests in a second captive colony showed that higher rates of novel object exploration were shown by young of both sexes. Our results corroborate past findings from other mammals and birds that age predicts exploration. If age-dependent exploration is indeed adaptive, then the role of age as a predictor of exploration tendency should depend on species-specific life history traits. Finally, because younger vampire bats also appear to have higher exposure to pathogens such as rabies virus, there may be implications for pathogen transmission if younger and more exploratory vampire bats are more likely to feed on novel hosts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gerald G.

The effects of age on neophobia and exploration are best described in birds and primates, and broader comparisons require reports from other taxa. Here we present data showing age-dependent exploration in a long-lived social species, the common vampire bat (&lt;i&gt;Desmodus rotundus&lt;/i&gt;). A previous study found that vampire bats regurgitated food to partners trapped in a cage.

Background &lt;p&gt;Social support has been identified as a significant factor in facilitating better health outcomes following injury. However, research has primarily focused on the role of social support from the perspective of the person experiencing an injury. Limited research has examined the experiences of the family members and friends of a person with injury. This study aims to explore the perceptions and experiences of social support and recovery following a transport-related musculoskeletal injury (MSI) in a population of injured persons and their family members and friends.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted using a phenomenological qualitative research design. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten persons with MSI, recruited via the Transport Accident Commission (TAC) in Victoria, Australia. Seven family members and friends were also interviewed. The data was analysed using constant comparative method and thematic analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Several themes were identified including: (1) key sources and types of support received, (2) relationship development and (3) challenges of providing and receiving support. Participants with MSI reported stories about how the social network provided emotional and tangible support. Family members and friends confirmed the supportive acts provided to the participants with MSI. Positive iterative changes in relationships were reported by the participants with MSI. Participants with MSI, their family members and friends described several difficulties including loss of independence, feeling like a burden, and the impact of caring on health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The role of social support is complex given the multitude of people involved in the recovery process. The findings of this study suggest that persons with MSI may benefit from support groups and maintenance of existing support networks. Furthermore, family members and friends engaged in the recovery process may benefit from support in this role.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Khic-Houy Prang, Sharon Newnam, Janneke Berecki-Gisolf&lt;/p&gt;

Fitness is determined by the ability of an organism to both survive and reproduce; however, the mechanisms that lead to increased survival may not have the same effect on reproductive success. We used nineteen natural &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; genotypes from the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Genetic Reference Panel to determine if adaptive plasticity following short-term acclimation through rapid cold-hardening (RCH) affects mating behavior and mating success. We confirmed that exposure to the acclimation temperature is beneficial to survival following cold stress; however, we found that this same acclimation temperature exposure led to less efficient male courtship and a significant decrease in the likelihood of mating. Cold tolerance and the capacity to respond plastically to cold stress were not correlated with mating behavior following acclimation, suggesting that the genetic control of the physiological effects of the cold temperature exposure likely differ between survival and behavioral responses. We also tested whether the exposure of males to the acclimation temperature influenced courtship song. This exposure again significantly increased courtship duration; however, courtship song was unchanged. These results illustrate costs of short-term acclimation on survival and reproductive components of fitness and demonstrate the pronounced effect that short-term thermal environment shifts can have on reproductive success.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth R.

High-risk injection related behavior including use of non-sterile syringes is associated with negative health outcomes among people who inject drugs (PWID). Drug treatment programs have been reported to curb hepatitis C (HCV) transmission. This study aims to assess the role of drug treatment programs and knowledge of HCV status, and how they influence current injection-related risk. Data were collected in 2012 by the New Orleans arm of the CDC funded National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit a sample of PWID. The analytic sample consisted of 473 participants. Univariate, bivariate, and linear regression analyses were performed. Findings indicated that history of drug treatment is associated with sterile syringe use among PWID. Further, knowledge of HCV status modifies the relationship between history of drug treatment and sterile syringe use in this sample. These findings highlight the importance of scaling up prevention efforts by expanding testing, counselling, and treatment for HCV among PWID who enter drug treatment facilities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kiva Ariani Fisher, Laura Michele Cahill, Stephanie Broyles, Marion Rorke, William Thomas Robinson&lt;/p&gt;

These data identify a role for electrical junctions in determining oscillation frequency and show how related species can rely on distinct network strategies to accomplish adaptive control of hormone release.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33144</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b5:91749e5b</id><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><updated>1524690000000</updated><published>1524690000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196174</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196174</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196174</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ilko L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Stroke-induced immunodepression is a well characterized complication of acute ischemic stroke. In experimental studies beta-blocker therapy reversed stroke-induced immunodepression, reduced infection rates and mortality. Recent, heterogeneous studies in stroke patients could not provide evidence of a protective effect of beta-blocker therapy. Aim of this study is to investigate the potential preventive effect of beta-blockers in subgroups of patients at high risk for stroke-induced immunodepression.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from a prospectively derived registry of major stroke patients receiving endovascular therapy between 2011–2017 in a tertiary stroke center (University Medical Center Göttingen. Germany) was used. The effect of beta-blocker therapy on pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis and mortality was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three hundred six patients with a mean age of 72 ± 13 years and a median NIHSS of 16 (IQR 10.75–20) were included. 158 patients (51.6%) had pre-stroke- and continued beta-blocker therapy. Beta-blocker therapy did not reduce the incidence of pneumonia (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31–1.92, p = 0.584), urinary tract infections (OR 1.51, 0.88–2.60, p = 0.135), sepsis (OR 0.57, 0.18–1.80, p = 0.334) or mortality (OR 0.59, 0.16–2.17, p = 0.429). Strokes involving the insula and anterio-medial cortex increased the risk for pneumonia (OR 4.55, 2.41–8.56, p&amp;lt;0.001) and sepsis (OR 4.13, 1.81–9.43, p = 0.001), while right hemispheric strokes increased the risk for pneumonia (OR 1.60, 0.92–2.77, p = 0.096). There was a non-significantly increased risk for urinary tract infections in patients with beta-blocker therapy and insula/anterio-medial cortex strokes (OR 3.12, 95% CI 0.88–11.05, p = 0.077) with no effect of beta-blocker therapy on pneumonia, sepsis or mortality in both subgroups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In major ischemic stroke patients, beta-blocker therapy did not lower post-stroke infection rates and was associated with urinary tract infections in a subgroup with insula/anterio-medial strokes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ilko L.

Any single nucleotide variant detection study could benefit from a fast and cheap method of measuring the quality of variant call list. It is advantageous to be able to see how the call list quality is affected by different variant filtering thresholds and other adjustments to the study parameters. Here we look into a possibility of estimating the proportion of true positives in a single nucleotide variant call list for human data. Using whole-exome and whole-genome gold standard data sets for training, we focus on building a generic model that only relies on information available from any variant caller. We assess and compare the performance of different candidate models based on their practical accuracy. We find that the generic model delivers decent accuracy most of the time. Further, we conclude that its performance could be improved substantially by leveraging the variant quality metrics that are specific to each variant calling tool.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nik Tuzov&lt;/p&gt;

In the traditional two-step procedure used in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, fluence map optimization (FMO) is performed first, followed by use of a leaf sequencing algorithm (LSA). By contrast, direct aperture optimization (DAO) directly optimizes aperture leaf positions and weights. However, dose calculation using the Monte Carlo (MC) method for DAO is often time-consuming. Therefore, a rapid DAO (RDAO) algorithm is proposed that uses a dose influence matrix based piecewise aperture dose model (DIM-PADM). In the proposed RDAO algorithm, dose calculation is based on the dose influence matrix instead of MC. The dose dependence of aperture leafs is modeled as a piecewise function using the DIM. The corresponding DIM-PADM-based DAO problem is solved using a simulated annealing algorithm.The proposed algorithm was validated through application to TG119, prostate, liver, and head and neck (H&amp;amp;N) cases from the common optimization for radiation therapy dataset. Compared with the two-step FMO–LSA procedure, the proposed algorithm resulted in more precise dose conformality in all four cases. Specifically, for the H&amp;amp;N dataset, the cost value for the planned target volume (PTV) was decreased by 32%, whereas the cost value for the two organs at risk (OARs) was decreased by 60% and 92%. Our study of the proposed novel DIM-PADM-based RDAO algorithm makes two main contributions: First, we validate the use of the proposed algorithm, in contrast to the FMO–LSA framework, for direct optimization of aperture leaf positions and show that this method results in more precise dose conformality. Second, we demonstrate that compared to MC, the DIM-PADM-based method significantly reduces the computational time required for DAO.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuejiao Zeng, Hao Gao, Xunbin Wei&lt;/p&gt;

Paget’s disease of bone (PDB) is a chronic bone disorder and although genetic factors appear to play an important role in its pathogenesis, to date PDB causing mutations were identified only in the &lt;i&gt;Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)&lt;/i&gt; gene at the &lt;i&gt;PDB3&lt;/i&gt; locus. &lt;i&gt;PDB6&lt;/i&gt; locus, also previously linked to PDB, contains several candidate genes for metabolic bone diseases. We focused our analysis in the most significantly associated variant with PDB, within the &lt;i&gt;Optineurin&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;OPTN)&lt;/i&gt; gene, i.e. the common variant rs1561570. Although it was previously shown to be strongly associated with PDB in several populations, its contribution to PDB pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study we have shown that rs1561570 may contribute to PDB since its &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; allele results in the loss of a methylation site in patients’ DNA, leading to higher levels of &lt;i&gt;OPTN&lt;/i&gt; gene expression and a corresponding increase in protein levels in patients’ osteoclasts. This increase in &lt;i&gt;OPTN&lt;/i&gt; expression leads to higher levels of NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and increasing expression of its target genes, which may contribute to the overactivity of osteoclasts observed in PDB. We also reported a tendency for a more severe clinical phenotype in the presence of a haplotype containing the rs1561570 &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; allele, which appear to be re-enforced with the presence of the &lt;i&gt;SQSTM1/P392L&lt;/i&gt; mutation. In conclusion, our work provides novel insight towards understanding the functional effects of this variant, located in &lt;i&gt;OPTN&lt;/i&gt; intron 7, and its implication in the contribution to PDB pathogenesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Iris A.

Under nitrogen deprivation, the one-dimensional cyanobacterial organism &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt; sp. PCC 7120 develops patterns of single, nitrogen-fixing cells separated by nearly regular intervals of photosynthetic vegetative cells. We study a minimal, stochastic model of developmental patterns in &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt; that includes a nondiffusing activator, two diffusing inhibitor morphogens, demographic fluctuations in the number of morphogen molecules, and filament growth. By tracking developing filaments, we provide experimental evidence for different spatiotemporal roles of the two inhibitors during pattern maintenance and for small molecular copy numbers, justifying a stochastic approach. In the deterministic limit, the model yields Turing patterns within a region of parameter space that shrinks markedly as the inhibitor diffusivities become equal. Transient, noise-driven, stochastic Turing patterns are produced outside this region, which can then be fixed by downstream genetic commitment pathways, dramatically enhancing the robustness of pattern formation, also in the biologically relevant situation in which the inhibitors&apos; diffusivities may be comparable.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YCarz8vRFKU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francesca Di Patti, Laura Lavacchi, Rinat Arbel-Goren, Leora Schein-Lubomirsky, Duccio Fanelli, Joel Stavans&lt;/p&gt;

The rickettsiae are obligate intracellular alphaproteobacteria that exhibit a complex infectious life cycle in both arthropod and mammalian hosts. As obligate intracellular bacteria, rickettsiae are highly adapted to living inside a variety of host cells, including vascular endothelial cells during mammalian infection. Although it is assumed that the rickettsiae produce numerous virulence factors that usurp or disrupt various host cell pathways, they have been challenging to genetically manipulate to identify the key bacterial factors that contribute to infection. Motivated to overcome this challenge, we sought to expand the repertoire of available rickettsial loss-of-function mutants, using an improved &lt;i&gt;mariner&lt;/i&gt;-based transposon mutagenesis scheme. Here, we present the isolation of over 100 transposon mutants in the spotted fever group species &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia parkeri&lt;/i&gt;. Transposon insertions disrupted genes whose products are implicated in a variety of pathways, including bacterial replication and metabolism, the type IV secretion system, factors with previously established roles in host cell interactions and pathogenesis, or are of unknown function. Given the need to identify critical virulence factors, forward genetic screens such as this will provide an excellent platform to more directly investigate rickettsial biology and pathogenesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

Hand hygiene practice in hospitals is unfortunately still widely insufficient, even though it is known that transmitting pathogens via hands is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour. Electronic monitoring and feedback devices were installed in hospital patient rooms on top of hand-rub dispensers, next to the doorway, for a period of 17 weeks. In the emoticon condition, screens at the devices activated whenever a person entered or exited the room. Before using the alcohol-based hand-rub dispenser, a frowny face was displayed, indicating that hand hygiene should be performed. If the dispenser was subsequently used, this picture changed to a smiley face to positively reinforce the correct behaviour. Hand hygiene behaviour in the emoticon rooms significantly outperformed the behaviour in three other tested conditions. The strong effect in this field experiment indicates that activating injunctive norms may be a promising approach to improve hand hygiene behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Gaube, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, Daniel Dollinger, Eva Lermer&lt;/p&gt;

Mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is a key regulator of organelle physiology and the excessive increase in mitochondrial calcium is associated with the oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial calcium to inflammatory and coagulative responses in hepatocytes exposed to high glucose (HG) (33mM glucose). Treatment of HepG2 cells with HG for 24 h induced insulin resistance, as demonstrated by an impairment of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. HepG2 treatment with HG led to an increase in mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake, while cytosolic calcium remained unchanged. Inhibition of MCU by lentiviral-mediated shRNA prevented mitochondrial calcium uptake and downregulated the inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6) and coagulative (PAI-1 and FGA) mRNA expression in HepG2 cells exposed to HG. The protection from HG-induced inflammation by MCU inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, MCU inhibition in HepG2 cells abrogated the phosphorylation of p38, JNK and IKKα/IKKβ in HG treated cells. Taken together, these data suggest that MCU inhibition may represent a promising therapy for prevention of deleterious effects of obesity and metabolic diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ghodratollah Panahi, Parvin Pasalar, Mina Zare, Rosario Rizzuto, Reza Meshkani&lt;/p&gt;

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß. Our findings define a novel role for AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes via its modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin and NF-κB signaling activities and the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Minashima, Thorsten Kirsch&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings define a novel role for AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes via its modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin and NF-κB signaling activities and the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways.</description><fingerprint>d53b7919</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Annexin A6 regulates catabolic events in articular chondrocytes via the modulation of NF-κB and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197690</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1631d51f359:2877c8f:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1525205300057</crawled><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/18.cover-source.jpg?itok=V2AnzLfA</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><published>1525190778000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4535.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4535</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4535.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Dario F.

Background &lt;p&gt;Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a new tool developed to overcome some limitations of pairwise meta-analyses. NMAs provide evidence on more than two comparators simultaneously. This study aimed to map the characteristics of the published NMAs on drug therapy comparisons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review of NMAs comparing pharmacological interventions was performed. Searches in Medline (PubMed) and Scopus along with manual searches were conducted. The main characteristics of NMAs were systematically collected: publication metadata, criteria for drug inclusion, statistical methods used, and elements reported. A methodological quality score with 25 key elements was created and applied to the included NMAs. To identify potential trends, the median of the publication year distribution was used as a cut-off.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study identified 365 NMAs published from 2003 to 2016 in more than 30 countries. Randomised controlled trials were the primary source of data, with only 5% including observational studies, and 230 NMAs used a placebo as a comparator. Less than 15% of NMAs were registered in PROSPERO or a similar system. One third of studies followed PRISMA and less than 9% Cochrane recommendations. Around 30% presented full-search strategies of the systematic review, and 146 NMAs stated the selection criteria for drug inclusion. Over 75% of NMAs presented network plots, but only half described their geometry. Statistical parameters (model fit, inconsistency, convergence) were properly reported by one third of NMAs. Although 216 studies exhibited supplemental material, no data set of primary studies was available. The methodological quality score (mean 13·9; SD 3·8) presented a slightly positive trend over the years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The map of the published NMAs emphasises the potential of this tool to gather evidence in healthcare, but it also identified some weaknesses, especially in the report, which limits its transparency and reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fernanda S.

The Denmark group at Illinois &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b03187&quot;&gt;has investigated a range&lt;/a&gt; of silicon-containing heterocycles, providing both synthetic routes into the (mostly unknown) structures, and looking at some basic pharmaceutically relevant properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work in this paper on the synthetic procedures, both to prepare these compounds and to investigate their chemistry. What it tells you is that (as you would have figured) that C-to-Si is a nontrivial switch in the fume hood, because the chemistries involved can be quite different. For instance, that first core on the list does N-alkylation and N-acylation reactions just fine, but when you try to do metal-catalyzed N-C couplings on it, things go to pieces (protodesilylation and other decomposition reactions). Protodesilylation in general was something that had to be looked out for, with attention paid to solvent choice and temperature in the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme that comes up several times is that the nitrogens, when exposed to base, can be significantly more prone to oxidative side reactions than expected (even fairly simple reductive amination reactions had to be performed under inert atmosphere, although they were successful then). Metalation reactions were also tricky. Some of them worked just fine and reacted as expected with a range of electrophiles, while others would work with some partners but not others. But some of them just fell apart immediately on attempts to form the anions (such as C2 of the second compound on the list shown), and the only way to find that out was to try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the group was able to prepare an impressive range of functionalized derivatives of these cores, almost all of which are shots into unknown territory. How, then, do such compounds behave? Their cLogP values are almost invariably higher than their carbon analogs, but as usual when you move into unusual structure space, it would be interesting to have some experimental values to make sure that that some of this just isn’t a problem with the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the Si and C matched pairs in assays, there seems to be no difference in P-gp transporter behavior &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, for starters. There was a slight trend towards more instability against CYP enzymes, but this wasn’t universal (and was also species-dependent, with the rat enzymes being more vigorous. (That’s often the case; rats have a reputation for having more strongly oxidizing liver enzymes, which I’ve always attributed to their rather broad definitions of suitable food). Inhibition of these enzymes didn’t show much of a trend one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second compound on the list above and its carbon analog were compared in rat PK experiments as well (oral and i.v.) Intravenous behavior was fairly similar – the Si compound had slightly higher clearance and slightly higher volume of distribution. As for p.o. dosing, the Si compound is significantly more bioavailable, although it has a lower Cmax. Overall AUC was pretty much the same, though. And even though it had greater instability to the rat enzymes, it had a twofold great half-life&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, which makes you think plasma protein binding. So this is only one point, but taken with the other Si compounds in the literature, it seems as if they fall inside the normal range of variation that you see with all-carbon compounds – there’s nothing intrinsically weird about them from a pharmacokinetic/metabolic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up what I mentioned in my past last year, though: perhaps it would be better for silicon-containing drugs if there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; something unusual about them. Admittedly, that could also be “unusually bad”, but overall, it’s harder to make the case for moving to silicon if the effects of doing so are (a) not huge and (b) not all that predictable. You’re already in that zone with carbon analogs, most likely, so why bother? The paper itself has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This lack of success in the pharmaceutical industry may be attributed to two key factors: (1) an absence of general and accessible synthetic methods for the construction of appropriately functionalized silicon-containing molecules and (2) ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon, of which the “carbon/silicon switch” is the most common. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that second point is what we’re talking about. “Ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon”, from another angle, means “lack of a good reason to use it at all”. If some effective uses for it can be found – and they may well be out there, who knows? – then things will change. But not until then. If the late-stage silicon switch doesn’t necessarily get you anything, it’s true that you’re going to have to look earlier (good activity in a silicon-containing compound that isn’t replicated by its carbon analog), and this work is an attempt to provide a host of new Si-containing chemical matter towards that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would go a long way to answering the overall question would be if someone were to produce a library of (say) ten or twenty thousand diverse silicon-containing drug-like structures and their exact carbon analogs, and do some high-throughput screening campaigns (variously targeted, cellular, and phenotypic) to see how they behave. But no one’s going to go to that trouble just yet, for just the reasons described (an absence of ways to make such things and an absence of compelling reasons to make them). The chicken and egg question remains.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>Here’s an update to a post from last year about silicon in drug-like molecules.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) originating from eukaryotes or bacteria have been under intensive structural and biochemical investigation, whereas archaeal PTP proteins have not been investigated extensively; therefore, they are poorly understood. Here, we present the crystal structures of Tk-PTP derived from the hyperthermophilic archaeon &lt;i&gt;Thermococcus kodakaraensis&lt;/i&gt; KOD1, in both the active and inactive forms. Tk-PTP adopts a common dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) fold, but it undergoes an atypical temperature-dependent conformational change in its P-loop and α4−α5 loop regions, switching between the inactive and active forms. Through comprehensive analyses of Tk-PTP, including additional structural determination of the G95A mutant form, enzymatic activity assays, and structural comparison with the other archaeal PTP, it was revealed that the presence of the GG motif in the P-loop is necessary but not sufficient for the structural flexibility of Tk-PTP. It was also proven that Tk-PTP contains dual general acid/base residues unlike most of the other DUSP proteins, and that both the residues are critical in its phosphatase activity. This work provides the basis for expanding our understanding of the previously uncharacterized PTP proteins from archaea, the third domain of living organisms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hye-Yeoung Yun, Jinhyuk Lee, Hyunmin Kim, Hyojung Ryu, Ho-Chul Shin, Byung-Ha Oh, Bonsu Ku, Seung Jun Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Cutting-edge high-dimensional analysis methods are successful in characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but they suffer from the &apos;curse of dimensionality&apos; and non-standardized outputs. Results: Here we introduce RefCell, a multi-dimensional analysis pipeline for image-based HTS that focuses on reproducible capturing of cells with typical features of control cell state (i.e., typical cells), and use these cells as a reference for perturbed cell states. RefCell quantitatively assesses the heterogeneous deviations from the typical behavior for each analyzed perturbation/ sample. Conclusions: We apply RefCell to the analysis of data from a high-throughput imaging screen of a library of 320 ubiquitin protein targeted siRNAs selected to gain insights into the mechanisms of premature aging (progeria).

Cutting-edge high-dimensional analysis methods are successful in characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but they suffer from the &apos;curse of dimensionality&apos; and non-standardized outputs. Results: Here we introduce RefCell, a multi-dimensional analysis pipeline for image-based HTS that focuses on reproducible capturing of cells with typical features of control cell state (i.e., typical cells), and use these cells as a reference for perturbed cell states. RefCell quantitatively assesses the heterogeneous deviations from the typical behavior for each analyzed perturbation/ sample. Conclusions: We apply RefCell to the analysis of data from a high-throughput imaging screen of a library of 320 ubiquitin protein targeted siRNAs selected to gain insights into the mechanisms of premature aging (progeria). We compare RefCell results to a clustering based single cell analysis methods as well as conventional average based results. RefCell is able to identify similar results as the other two methods. In addition, RefCell is able to identify perturbations that deviate cells far from the control states.

Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development. In human societies, however, there exists bias toward interacting with partners with similar characteristics, but not contributing globally. We study how complex interactive behaviors evolve under risks through proposing a threshold public goods game model. In the model, individuals either play games with participants who own the same phenotype, or contribute to the collective target of global public goods. We further introduce an insurance compensation mechanism into the model to probe the evolution of global cooperation. It is found that the introduction of the insurance remarkably promotes the emergence of global cooperative behavior and inhibits the tendency to play games only with individuals of the same phenotype. Besides, contrary to models without insurance, global cooperation is strengthened with the increase of imitation intensities. In addition, high risk and high threshold are in favor of global cooperation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinming Du&lt;/p&gt;

The stress-induced mutagenesis hypothesis postulates that in response to stress, bacteria increase their genome-wide mutation rate, in turn increasing the chances that a descendant is able to better withstand the stress. This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell division are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YW43eur48VA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is state of the art in molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this context, maintenance of assay fidelity and detection of technical inaccuracy are crucial. Beside multiple common negative controls for the clinical sample preparations, quality control charts (QCC) are a common validation tool to sustain high process quality by continuously recording of qRT-PCR control parameters. Here, we report on establishment and benefit of QCC in qRT-PCR-based CML diagnostics. The absolute quantification of &lt;i&gt;BCR-ABL1&lt;/i&gt; fusion transcripts in patient samples is based on coamplification of a serially diluted reference plasmid (pME-2). For QCC establishment the measured Ct values of each pME-2 standard dilution (4–400,000) of a test set resembling 21 sequential qRT-PCR experiments were recorded and statistically evaluated. Test set data were used for determination of warning limits (mean +/- 2-fold standard deviation) and control (intervention) limits (mean +/- 3-fold standard deviation) to allow rapid detection of defined out-of-control situations which may require intervention. We have retrospectively analyzed QCC data of 282 sequential qRT-PCR experiments (564 reactions). Data evaluation using QCCs revealed three out-of-control situations that required intervention like experiment repeats, renewal of pME-2 standards, replacement of reagents or personnel re-training. In conclusion, with minimal more effort and hands-on time QCC rank among the best tools to grant high quality and reproducibility in CML routine molecular diagnosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Birgit Spiess, Nicole Naumann, Norbert Galuschek, Sébastien Rinaldetti, Ute Kossak-Roth, Irina Tarnopolscaia, Elena Felde, Alice Fabarius, Wolf-Karsten Hofmann, Susanne Saußele, Wolfgang Seifarth&lt;/p&gt;

How will coastal soils in areas newly flooded with seawater function as habitat for benthic marine organisms? This research question is highly relevant as global sea level rise and coastal realignment will cause flooding of soils and form new marine habitats. In this study, we tested experimentally the capacity of common marine polychaetes, &lt;i&gt;Marenzelleria viridis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nereis (Hediste) diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scoloplos armiger&lt;/i&gt; to colonize and modify the biogeochemistry of the newly established Gyldensteen Coastal Lagoon, Denmark. All tested polychaetes survived relatively well (28–89%) and stimulated carbon dioxide release (TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by 97–105% when transferred to newly flooded soils, suggesting that soil characteristics are modified rapidly by colonizing fauna. A field survey showed that the pioneering benthic community inside the lagoon was structurally different from the marine area outside the lagoon, and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;viridis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armiger&lt;/i&gt; were not among the early colonizers. These were instead &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Polydora cornuta&lt;/i&gt; with an abundance of 1603 and 540 ind m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Considering the species-specific effects of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; on TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release and its average abundance in the lagoon, we estimate that organic carbon degradation was increased by 219% in the first year of flooding. We therefore conclude that early colonizing polychaetes modify the soils and may play an important role in the ecological and successional developments, e.g. C cycling and biodiversity, in newly flooded coastal ecosystems. Newly flooded soils have thus a strong potential to develop into well-functioning marine ecosystems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Valdemarsen, Cintia O.

NTC was able to efficiently prevent worm development at very low concentrations, and the worms expressing &lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; were able to survive on the selection plates without any developmental defects.

The structure and spectrum of NTC differs from other antibiotics like hygromycin B and geneticin, making it possible to use NTC alongside them. Indeed, we confirmed NTC-&lt;i&gt;sat2&lt;/i&gt; selection could work with the hygromycin B selection system simultaneously.

The hydrography and dynamics of NW Iberian margin were explored for July 2009, based on a set of in situ and remote sensing observations. Zonal sections of standard CTD casts, towed CTD (SeaSoar), Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and Lagrangian surveys were made to characterize cycles of upwelling and relaxation in this region. Two periods of northerly winds, bounded by relaxation periods, were responsible for the formation of an upwelling front extending to the shelf edge. An equatorward flow was quickly set up on the shelf responding to the northerly wind pulses. South of Cape Silleiro, the development and subsequent relaxation of an upwelling event was intensively surveyed in the shelf, following a Lagrangian drifter transported by the upwelling jet. This region is part of an upwelling center extending from Cape Silleiro to Porto, where the surface temperature was colder than the neighboring regions, under upwelling favorable winds. As these winds relaxed, persistent poleward flow developed, originating south of the upwelling center and consisting in an inner-shelf tongue of warm waters. During an event of strong southerly wind, the poleward flow was observed to extend to the whole continental shelf. Although the cruise was executed during summertime, the presence of river-plumes was observed over the shelf. The interaction of the plumes with the circulation on the shelf was also described in terms of coastal convergence and offshore advection. The sampling of the offshore and slope regions showed the presence of the Iberian poleward current offshore and a persistent equatorward flow over the upper slope.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nuno Gonçalo Ferreira Cordeiro, Jesus Dubert, Rita Nolasco, Eric Desmond Barton&lt;/p&gt;

L-Proline is a multifunctional amino acid that plays an essential role in primary metabolism and physiological functions. Proline is oxidized to glutamate in the mitochondria and the FAD-containing enzyme proline oxidase (PO) catalyzes the first step in L-proline degradation pathway. Alterations in proline metabolism have been described in various human diseases, such as hyperprolinemia type I, velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Di George syndrome, schizophrenia and cancer. In particular, the mutation giving rise to the substitution &lt;i&gt;Leu441Pro&lt;/i&gt; was identified in patients suffering of schizophrenia and hyperprolinemia type I. Here, we report on the expression of wild-type and &lt;i&gt;L441P&lt;/i&gt; variants of human PO in a U87 glioblastoma human cell line in an attempt to assess their effect on glutamate metabolism. The subcellular localization of the flavoenzyme is not altered in the &lt;i&gt;L441P&lt;/i&gt; variant, for which specific activity is halved compared to the wild-type PO. While this decrease in activity is significantly less than that previously proposed, an effect of the substitution on the enzyme stability is also apparent in our studies. At 24 hours of growth from transient transfection, the intracellular level of proline, glutamate, and glutamine is decreased in cells expressing the PO variants as compared to control U87 cells, reaching a similar figure at 72 h. On the other hand, the extracellular levels of the three selected amino acids show a similar time course for all clones. Furthermore, PO overexpression does not modify to a significant extent the expression of GLAST and GLT-1 glutamate transporters. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the proline pathway links cellular proline levels with those of glutamate and glutamine. On this side, PO might play a regulatory role in glutamatergic neurotransmission by affecting the cellular concentration of glutamate.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pamela Cappelletti, Elena Tallarita, Valentina Rabattoni, Paola Campomenosi, Silvia Sacchi, Loredano Pollegioni&lt;/p&gt;

A novel α-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 was cloned from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/i&gt;, overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and characterized. The purified enzyme Aga-BC7050 was 85 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and 168 kDa according to gel filtration, indicating that its native structure is a dimer. With &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl-α-d- galactopyranoside (pNPGal) as the substrate, optimal temperature and pH were 55 °C and 6.0, respectively. At 60 °C for 30 min, it retained &gt; 50% of its activity. It was stable at pH 5.0–10.0, and showed remarkable resistance to proteinase K, subtilisin A, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in &amp;lt; 30 min.

NAC proteins are a family of transcription factors which have a variety of important regulatory roles in plants. They present a very well conserved group of NAC subdomains in the N-terminal region and a highly variable domain at the C-terminus. Currently, knowledge concerning NAC family in the strawberry plant remains very limited. In this work, we analyzed the NAC family of &lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;, and a total of 112 NAC proteins were identified after we curated the annotations from the version 4.0.a1 genome. They were placed into the ligation groups (pseudo-chromosomes) and described its physicochemical and genetic features. A microarray transcriptomic analysis showed six of them expressed during the development and ripening of the &lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. Their expression patterns were studied in fruit (receptacle and achenes) in different stages of development and in vegetative tissues. Also, the expression level under different hormonal treatments (auxins, ABA) and drought stress was investigated. In addition, they were clustered with other NAC transcription factor with known function related to growth and development, senescence, fruit ripening, stress response, and secondary cell wall and vascular development. Our results indicate that these six strawberry NAC proteins could play different important regulatory roles in the process of development and ripening of the fruit, providing the basis for further functional studies and the selection for NAC candidates suitable for biotechnological applications.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enriqueta Moyano, Félix J.

Even though in Mendelian diseases strong associations can be found for certain SNPs, in most of the complex diseases only modest associations can be identified from the GWAS. Therefore, the main challenge in such studies is to understand how multiple SNPs that have modest association with the phenotype interact and contribute to its aetiology. This can only be done via pathway based analysis of modestly associated SNPs and the genes that are affected by these changes. Results: In this study, we propose DAPath, a Disease Associated Path analyzer tool for discovering signaling paths and the pathways that contain these paths which are subjected to cumulative impact of modestly associated variants. We applied our proposed method on Behcet&apos;s disease (BD) GWAS dataset from Japanese population. Antigen Processing and Presentation pathway is ranked first with 16 highly affected paths.

Even though in Mendelian diseases strong associations can be found for certain SNPs, in most of the complex diseases only modest associations can be identified from the GWAS. Therefore, the main challenge in such studies is to understand how multiple SNPs that have modest association with the phenotype interact and contribute to its aetiology. This can only be done via pathway based analysis of modestly associated SNPs and the genes that are affected by these changes. Results: In this study, we propose DAPath, a Disease Associated Path analyzer tool for discovering signaling paths and the pathways that contain these paths which are subjected to cumulative impact of modestly associated variants.

Understanding the functional basis of auxin homeostasis requires knowledge about auxin biosynthesis, auxin transport and auxin catabolism genes, which is not always directly available despite the recent whole-genome sequencing of many plant species. Through sequence homology searches and phylogenetic analyses on a selection of 11 plant species with high-quality genome annotation, we identified the putative gene homologs involved in auxin biosynthesis, auxin catabolism and auxin transport pathways in carnation (&lt;i&gt;Dianthus caryophyllus&lt;/i&gt; L.). To deepen our knowledge of the regulatory events underlying auxin-mediated adventitious root formation in carnation stem cuttings, we used RNA-sequencing data to confirm the expression profiles of some auxin homeostasis genes during the rooting of two carnation cultivars with different rooting behaviors. We also confirmed the presence of several auxin-related metabolites in the stem cutting tissues. Our findings offer a comprehensive overview of auxin homeostasis genes in carnation and provide a solid foundation for further experiments investigating the role of auxin homeostasis in the regulation of adventitious root formation in carnation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Belén Sánchez-García, Sergio Ibáñez, Antonio Cano, Manuel Acosta, José Manuel Pérez-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

The identification of germplasm resources is an important aspect of sugarcane breeding. The aim of this study was to introduce a new method for identifying &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny. First, we cloned and sequenced nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrDNA-ITS) sequences from 20 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms. Analysis of these nrDNA-ITS sequences showed a stable mutation at base 89. Primers (FO13, RO13, FI16, and RI16) were then designed for tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR based on mutations at base 89 of the nrDNA-ITS sequence. An additional 71 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms were identified using this tetra-primer ARMS PCR method, which confirmed that the method using the described primers successfully identified &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and progeny. These results may help improve the efficiency of modern molecular breeding of sugarcane and lay a foundation for identification of sugarcane germplasms and the relationships among them.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shan Yang, Xueting Li, Fei Huang, Yongji Huang, Xinlong Liu, Jiayun Wu, Qinnan Wang, Zuhu Deng, Rukai Chen, Muqing Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Asthma is the most common chronic disease during pregnancy and it may have influence on pregnancy outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our goal was to assess the association between maternal asthma and the perinatal risks as well as possible effects of asthma medication.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was based on a nationwide Finnish register-based cohort between the years 1996 and 2012 in the Drug and Pregnancy Database. The register data comprised 962 405 singleton live and stillbirths, 898 333 (93.3%) pregnancies in mothers with neither confirmed asthma nor use of asthma medication (controls), and 26 674 (2.8%) pregnancies with confirmed maternal asthma. 71% of mothers with asthma used asthma medication. The diagnosis of asthma was based on the mothers’ right for subsidised medication which is carefully evaluated by strict criteria including pulmonary function testing. Odds ratio was used in comparison. Premature birth (PB), low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal death were the main outcome measures.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Maternal asthma was associated with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for perinatal mortality 1.24 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.46), preterm birth 1.18 (1.11 to 1.25), low birth weight 1.29 (1.21 to 1.37), fetal growth restriction (SGA) 1.32, (1.24 to 1.40), and asphyxia 1.09 (1.02 to 1.17). Asthma treatment reduced the increased risk of preterm birth aOR 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) but mothers with treated asthma had higher risks of fetal growth restriction (SGA) aOR 1.26 (1.10 to 1.45), and asphyxia aOR 1.37 (1.17 to 1.61) than mothers with untreated asthma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Asthma is associated with increased risks of perinatal mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction (SGA), and asphyxia.

Asthma treatment reduces the risk of preterm delivery, but it does not seem to reduce other complications such as perinatal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>aaafbad4</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Maternal asthma is associated with increased risk of perinatal mortality</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197593</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1634619c5fc:d47db7:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525889484284</crawled><published>1525888246000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaam6651?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/440/eaam6651.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaam6651?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Strnadel, J., Carromeu, C., Bardy, C., Navarro, M., Platoshyn, O., Glud, A.

We have developed our original tissue engineering technology “cell sheet engineering” utilizing temperature-responsive culture dishes. The cells are confluently grown on a temperature-responsive culture dish and can be harvested as a cell sheet by lowering temperature without enzymatic digestion. Cell sheets are high-cell-density tissues similar to actual living tissues, maintaining their structure and function. Based on this “cell sheet engineering”, we are trying to create functional cardiac tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells, for regenerative therapy and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing. Toward this purpose, it is necessary to evaluate the contractility of engineered cardiac cell sheets. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a contractile force measurement system and evaluated the contractility of human iPSC-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissues. By attaching the cardiac cell sheets on fibrin gel sheets, we created dynamically beating cardiac cell sheet-tissues. They were mounted to the force measurement system and the contractile force was measured stably and clearly. The absolute values of contractile force were around 1 mN, and the mean force value per cross-sectional area was 3.3 mN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are equivalent to or larger than many previously reported values, indicating the functionality of our engineered cardiac cell sheets. We also confirmed that both the contractile force and beating rate were significantly increased by the administration of adrenaline, which are the physiologically relevant responses for cardiac tissues. In conclusion, the force measurement system developed in the present study is valuable for the evaluation of engineered cardiac cell sheet-tissues, and for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing as well.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daisuke Sasaki, Katsuhisa Matsuura, Hiroyoshi Seta, Yuji Haraguchi, Teruo Okano, Tatsuya Shimizu&lt;/p&gt;

In conclusion, the force measurement system developed in the present study is valuable for the evaluation of engineered cardiac cell sheet-tissues, and for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing as well.</description><fingerprint>c05af95</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Contractile force measurement of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissue</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198026</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_163500d9399:40fac2:f3bf0074</id><crawled>1526056457113</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00090/20180511/images/medium/bi-2018-00090w_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>206</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1526011200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00090</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00090</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00090</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Elias Flores, Giovanni Gadda</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00090/20180511/images/medium/bi-2018-00090w_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00090&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds with variable phenolic structures, have been found to possess anti-cancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors like CDK6. To understand the binding behavior of flavonoids that inhibit the active CDK6, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on six inhibitors, chrysin (M01), fisetin (M03), galangin (M04), genistein (M05), quercetin (M06) and kaempferol (M07), complexed with CDK6/cyclin D. For all six flavonoids, the 3’-OH and 4’-OH of B-ring were found to be favorable for hydrogen bond formation, but the 3-OH on the C-ring and 5-OH on the A-ring were unfavorable, which were confirmed by the MD simulation results of the test molecule, 3’, 4’, 7-trihydroxyflavone (M15). The binding efficiencies of flavonoids against the CDK6/cyclin D complex were mainly through the electrostatic (especially the H-bond force) and vdW interactions with residues ILE19, VAL27, ALA41, GLU61, PHE98, GLN103, ASP163 and LEU152. The order of binding affinities of these flavonoids toward the CDK6/cyclin D was M03 &gt; M01 &gt; M07 &gt; M15 &gt; M06 &gt; M05 &gt; M04. It is anticipated that the binding features of flavonoid inhibitors studied in the present work may provide valuable insights for the development of CDK6 inhibitors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jingxiao Zhang, Lilei Zhang, Yangcheng Xu, Shanshan Jiang, Yueyue Shao&lt;/p&gt;

Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an essential exonuclease in mammalian cells, and numerous in vivo and in vitro data evidenced its participation in immunity regulation and in genotoxicity remediation. In these very complicated cellular functions, the molecular mechanisms by which duplex DNA substrates are processed are mostly elusive because of the lack of structure information. Here, we report multiple crystal structures of TREX1 complexed with various substrates to provide the structure basis for overhang excision and terminal unwinding of DNA duplexes. The substrates were designed to mimic the intermediate structural DNAs involved in various repair pathways. The results showed that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster of TREX1 served to cap the nonscissile 5′-end of the DNA for precise removal of the short 3′-overhang in L- and Y-structural DNA or to wedge into the double-stranded region for further digestion along the duplex. Biochemical assays were also conducted to demonstrate that TREX1 can indeed degrade double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to a full extent. Overall, this study provided unprecedented knowledge at the molecular level on the enzymatic substrate processing involved in prevention of immune activation and in responses to genotoxic stresses. For example, Arg128, whose mutation in TREX1 was linked to a disease state, were shown to exhibit consistent interaction patterns with the nonscissile strand in all of the structures we solved. Such structure basis is expected to play an indispensable role in elucidating the functional activities of TREX1 at the cellular level and in vivo.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nbs4P4qHduo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Wei Huang, Tung-Chang Liu, Ruei-Yue Liang, Lee-Ya Chu, Hiu-Lo Cheng, Jhih-Wei Chu, Yu-Yuan Hsiao&lt;/p&gt;

Genome-wide in vivo protein-DNA interactions are routinely mapped using high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP-reported regions are typically investigated for enriched sequence-motifs, which are likely to model the DNA-binding specificity of the profiled protein and/or of co-occurring proteins. However, simple enrichment analyses can miss insights into the binding-activity of the protein. Note that ChIP reports regions making direct contact with the protein as well as those binding through intermediaries. For example, consider a ChIP experiment targeting protein X, which binds DNA at its cognate sites, but simultaneously interacts with four other proteins. Each of these proteins also binds to its own specific cognate sites along distant parts of the genome, a scenario consistent with the current view of transcriptional hubs and chromatin loops. Since ChIP will pull down all X-associated regions, the final reported data will be a union of five distinct sets of regions, each containing binding sites of one of the five proteins, respectively. Characterizing all five different motifs &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the corresponding sets is important to interpret the ChIP experiment and ultimately, the role of X in regulation. We present diversity which attempts exactly this: it partitions the data so that each partition can be characterized with its own de novo motif. Diversity uses a Bayesian approach to identify the optimal number of motifs and the associated partitions, which &lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt; explain the entire dataset. This is in contrast to standard motif finders, which report motifs &lt;i&gt;individually&lt;/i&gt; enriched in the data, but do not necessarily explain all reported regions. We show that the different motifs and associated regions identified by diversity give insights into the various complexes that may be forming along the chromatin, something that has so far not been attempted from ChIP data.

In recent years, two-photon calcium imaging has become a standard tool to probe the function of neural circuits and to study computations in neuronal populations. However, the acquired signal is only an indirect measurement of neural activity due to the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium indicators. Different algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium measurements have been proposed in the past, but it is an open question how far performance can be improved. Here, we report the results of the &lt;i&gt;spikefinder&lt;/i&gt; challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a1WS4uygAIc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Berens, Jeremy Freeman, Thomas Deneux, Nicolay Chenkov, Thomas McColgan, Artur Speiser, Jakob H.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christi Patten, James Levine, Ioannis Pavlidis, Joyce Balls-Berry, Arya Shah, Christine Hughes, Tabetha Brockman, Miguel Valdez Soto, Daniel Witt, Gabriel Koepp, Pamela Sinicrope, Jamie Richards&lt;/p&gt;

The prevalence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly. Probiotics supplementation have been shown to improve metabolic health in humans. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health and pregnancy complications in pregnant women. The literature search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed, and data were synthesized in accordance with standardized guidelines. Ten randomized clinical trials with eligible data were included in our meta-analysis. For pregnant women with GDM, we found negative correlations between probiotics supplementation and fasting serum insulin (OR -2.94, 95%CI [-5.69, -0.20], p = 0.04) and homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (OR -0.65, 95%CI [-1.18, -0.11], p = 0.02). There were no significant correlations between probiotics supplementation and lipid levels in women with GDM, including total cholesterol (OR -2.72, 95%CI [-17.18, 11.74], P = 0.71), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (OR -0.29, 95%CI [-3.60, 3.03], P = 0.87), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (OR -0.38, 95%CI [-18.54, 17.79], P = 0.97), or triglycerides (OR -12.83, 95%CI [-36.63, 10.97], P = 0.29). For healthy pregnant women, probiotics supplementation were negatively associated with fasting serum insulin (OR -3.76, 95%CI [-4.29, -3.23], P &amp;lt; 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (OR -0.57, 95%CI [-1.08, -0.06], p = 0.03). However, no significant correlations were observed between probiotics supplementation and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (OR -2.02, 95%CI [-5.56, 1.52], p = 0.26). Thus, our study revealed that probiotics supplementation during pregnancy have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, rather than lipid metabolism among pregnant women.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jia Zheng, Qianyun Feng, Sheng Zheng, Xinhua Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Monocyte-like cell lines (MCLCs), including THP-1, HL-60 and U-937 cells, are used routinely as surrogates for isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To systematically evaluate these immortalised cells and PBMCs as model systems to study inflammation relevant to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes and immuno-metabolism, we compared mRNA expression of inflammation-relevant genes, cell surface expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers, and chemotactic responses to inflammatory stimuli. Messenger RNA expression analysis suggested most genes were present at similar levels across all undifferentiated cells, though notably, &lt;i&gt;IDO1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and catabolises tryptophan to kynureninase (shown to be elevated in serum from diabetic patients), was not expressed in any PMA-treated MCLC, but present in GM-CSF-treated PBMCs. There was little overall difference in the pattern of expression of CD markers across all cells, though absolute expression levels varied considerably and the correlation between MCLCs and PBMCs was improved upon MCLC differentiation. Functionally, THP-1 and PBMCs migrated in response to chemoattractants in a transwell assay, with varying sensitivity to MCP-1, MIP-1α and LTB-4. However, despite similar gene and CD expression profiles, U-937 cells were functionally impaired as no migration was observed to any chemoattractant. Our analysis reveals that the MCLCs examined only partly replicate the genotypic and phenotypic properties of human PBMCs. To overcome such issues a universal differentiation protocol should be implemented for these cell lines, similar to those already used with isolated monocytes. Although not perfect, in our hands the THP-1 cells represent the closest, simplified surrogate model of PBMCs for study of inflammatory cell migration.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Darren M.

However, the site-specific substrate within these engram cells remains theoretical, even though it is generally accepted that synaptic plasticity encodes memories. We developed the dual-eGRASP (green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners) technique to examine synapses between engram cells to identify the specific neuronal site for memory storage.

BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1–10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arturo Blazquez-Navarro, Thomas Schachtner, Ulrik Stervbo, Anett Sefrin, Maik Stein, Timm H.

Freshwater reservoir offsets (FROs) occur when AMS dates on charred, encrusted food residues on pottery predate a pot’s chronological context because of the presence of ancient carbon from aquatic resources such as fish. Research over the past two decades has demonstrated that FROs vary widely within and between water bodies and between fish in those water bodies. Lipid analyses have identified aquatic biomarkers that can be extracted from cooking residues as potential evidence for FROs. However, lacking has been efforts to determine empirically how much fish with FROs needs to be cooked in a pot with other resources to result in significant FRO on encrusted cooking residue and what percentage of fish C in a residue is needed to result in the recovery of aquatic biomarkers. Here we provide preliminary assessments of both issues.

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, can elude hosts’ innate and adaptive immunity as part of the course of infection. The ability of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; to invade or be internalized by host cells in vitro has been proposed as a mechanism for the pathogen to evade immune responses or antimicrobials. We have previously shown that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; can be internalized by human neuroglial cells. In this study we demonstrate that these cells take up &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; via coiling phagocytosis mediated by the formin, Daam1, a process similarly described for human macrophages. Following coincubation with glial cells, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was enwrapped by Daam1-enriched coiling pseudopods. Coiling of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was significantly reduced when neuroglial cells were pretreated with anti-Daam1 antibody indicating the requirement for Daam1 for borrelial phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy showed Daam1 colocalizing to the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface suggesting interaction with borrelial membrane protein(s). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system for identifying protein-protein binding, we found that the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface lipoprotein, BBA66, bound the FH2 subunit domain of Daam1. Recombinant proteins were used to validate binding by ELISA, pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence for native Daam1 and BBA66 interaction was suggested by colocalization of the proteins in the course of borrelial capture by the Daam1-enriched pseudopodia. Additionally, we found a striking reduction in coiling for a BBA66-deficient mutant strain compared to BBA66-expressing strains. These results show that coiling phagocytosis is a mechanism for borrelial internalization by neuroglial cells mediated by Daam1.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shanna K.

These results show that coiling phagocytosis is a mechanism for borrelial internalization by neuroglial cells mediated by Daam1.</description><fingerprint>68330383</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Human neuroglial cells internalize &amp;lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&amp;lt;/i&gt; by coiling phagocytosis mediated by Daam1</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197413</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4225f:5785ab88</id><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><updated>1525726800000</updated><published>1525726800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196940</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196940</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196940</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Duong H.

Urbanization has been driven by various social, economic, and political factors around the world for centuries. Because urbanization continues unabated in many places, it is crucial to understand patterns of urbanization and their potential ecological and environmental impacts. Given this need, the objectives of our study were to quantify urban growth rates, growth modes, and resultant changes in the landscape pattern of urbanization in Hanoi, Vietnam from 1993 to 2010 and to evaluate the extent to which the process of urban growth in Hanoi conformed to the diffusion-coalescence theory. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of the built-up land in Hanoi using landscape expansion modes, spatial metrics, and a gradient approach. Urbanization was most pronounced in the periods of 2001–2006 and 2006–2010 at a distance of 10 to 35 km around the urban center. Over the 17 year period urban expansion in Hanoi was dominated by infilling and edge expansion growth modes. Our findings support the diffusion-coalescence theory of urbanization. The shift of the urban growth areas over time and the dynamic nature of the spatial metrics revealed important information about our understanding of the urban growth process and cycle. Furthermore, our findings can be used to evaluate urban planning policies and aid in urbanization issues in rapidly urbanizing countries.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Duong H.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal allocation shifted when there were differences in transmission category proportions and progress along the HIV care continuum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The robustness of the results suggests that most health departments can use these analyses to guide the investment of CDC HIV prevention funds into strategies to prevent the most new cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emine Yaylali, Paul G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinju Ma, Liyi Ma, Hong Zhang, Zhongquan Zhang, Youqiong Wang, Kai Li, Xiaoming Chen&lt;/p&gt;

The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>64e44128</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Policosanol fabrication from insect wax and optimization by response surface methodology</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197343</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163872e3e14:6d409f8:2835af05</id><engagementRate>0.06</engagementRate><crawled>1526981344788</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1526972400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y</originId><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Reidun Twarock</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03713-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/8KBijYV-4JI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03713-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/8KBijYV-4JI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>aea5c7d0</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/8KBijYV-4JI/s41467-018-03713-y</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f76:2835af05</id><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><updated>1526072400000</updated><published>1526072400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197110</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197110</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197110</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jose María Gabriel y Galán</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jose María Gabriel y Galán, Antonio Murciano, Laure Sirvent, Abel Sánchez, James E.

Ferns are an important component of ecosystems around the world. Studies of the impacts that global changes may have on ferns are scarce, yet emerging studies indicate that some species may be particularly sensitive to climate change. The lack of research in this subject is much more aggravated in the case of epiphytes, and especially those that live under temperate climates. A mathematical model was developed for two temperate epiphytic ferns in order to predict potential impacts on spore germination kinetics, in response to different scenarios of global change, coming from increasing temperature and forest fragmentation. Our results show that an increasing temperature will have a negative impact over the populations of these temperate epiphytic ferns. Under unfragmented forests the germination percentage was comparatively less influenced than in fragmented patches. This study highlight that, in the long term, populations of the studied epiphytic temperate ferns may decline due to climate change. Overall, epiphytic fern communities will suffer changes in diversity, richness and dominance. Our study draws attention to the role of ferns in epiphytic communities of temperate forests, emphasizing the importance of considering these plants in any conservation strategy, specifically forest conservation. From a methodological point of view, the model we propose could be easily used to dynamically monitor the status of ecosystems, allowing the quick prediction of possible future scenarios, which is a crucial issue in biodiversity conservation decision-making.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jose María Gabriel y Galán, Antonio Murciano, Laure Sirvent, Abel Sánchez, James E.

A biophysical model that captures molecular homeostatic control of ions at the perisynaptic cradle (PsC) is of fundamental importance for understanding the interplay between astroglial and neuronal compartments. In this paper, we develop a multi-compartmental mathematical model which proposes a novel mechanism whereby the flow of cations in thin processes is restricted due to negatively charged membrane lipids which result in the formation of deep potential wells near the dipole heads. These wells restrict the flow of cations to “hopping” between adjacent wells as they transverse the process, and this surface retention of cations will be shown to give rise to the formation of potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microdomains at the PsC. We further propose that a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomain formed at the PsC, provides the driving force for the return of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the extracellular space for uptake by the neurone, thereby preventing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undershoot. A slow decay of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was also observed in our simulation after a period of glutamate stimulation which is in strong agreement with experimental observations. The pathological implications of microdomain formation during neuronal excitation are also discussed.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aFUE1uepp4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Breslin, John Joseph Wade, KongFatt Wong-Lin, Jim Harkin, Bronac Flanagan, Harm Van Zalinge, Steve Hall, Matthew Walker, Alexei Verkhratsky, Liam McDaid&lt;/p&gt;

Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lari Lehtovirta, Aleksi Reito, Jyrki Parkkinen, Sirpa Peräniemi, Jouko Vepsäläinen, Antti Eskelinen&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the thickness of retinal layers and association with final visual acuity using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in macular area of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients after a successful macular re-attachment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In retrospective study, a total 24 eyes with macula-off RRD were enrolled. All patients underwent vitrectomy to repair RRD. Outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor layer (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thicknesses were measured by the Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) SD-OCT with automated segmentation software. The relationship between the thicknesses of each retinal layer and postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale (LogMAR) visual acuity was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;OPL and RPE thicknesses were not significantly different between the retinal detachment eyes and fellow eyes (P = 0.839, 0.999, respectively). The ONL and photoreceptor thickness were significantly thinner in the retinal detachment eyes (P &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.001, respectively). In the univariate regression analysis, preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ONL thickness and photoreceptor thickness showed association with the postoperative BCVA (P = 0.003, &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.024, respectively). In final multiple linear regression model, ONL thickness was the only variable significantly associated with postoperative BCVA (P = 0.044).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Segmented ONL and photoreceptor thickness of retinal detachment eyes were significantly thinner than fellow eyes. Segmental analysis of the retinal layer in macular region may provide valuable information for evaluation RRD.

The Na/K-ATPase is an important membrane ion transporter and a signaling receptor that is essential for maintaining normal cell function. The current study examined the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulating miR-29b-3p, an anti-fibrotic microRNA, in a mouse chronic kidney disease (CKD) model (5/6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; partial nephrectomy or PNx). The results showed that CKD induced significant reduction of miR-29b-3p expression in the heart tissue by activation of Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. To demonstrate the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling, we also performed the PNx surgery on Na/K-ATPase α1 heterozygous (α1+/-) mice, which expresses ~40% less Na/K-ATPase α1 compared to their wild type littermates (WT) and exhibits deficiency in Na/K-ATPase signaling. We found that CKD did not significantly change the miR-29b-3p expression in heart tissue from the α1+/- animals. We also found that CKD failed to activate Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. Using isolated cardiac fibroblasts from α1+/- mice and their WT littermates, we showed that ouabain, a specific Na/K-ATPase ligand, induces decreased miR-29b-3p expression in fibroblasts isolated from WT mice, but had no effect in cells from α1+/- mice. Inhibition of NFκB by Bay11-7082 prevented ouabain-induced miR-29b-3p reduction in WT fibroblasts. To further confirm the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effect of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulation of miR-29b-3p and cardiac fibrosis in CKD animals, we used pNaKtide, a Src inhibiting peptide derived from the sequence of Na/K-ATPase, to block the activation of Na/K-ATPase signaling. The result showed that pNaKtide injection significantly increased miR-29b-3p expression and mitigated the CKD-induced cardiac fibrosis in these animals. These results clearly demonstrated that Na/K-ATPase signaling is an important mediator in CKD that regulates miR-29b-3p expression and cardiac fibrosis, which provides a novel target for regulation of miR-29b-3p in CKD. We also demonstrate that antagonizing Na/K-ATPase signaling by pNaKtide can reduce organ fibrosis through the stimulation of tissue miR-29b-3p expression.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher A.

Reactivity to post-­‐functionalization with thiol species via SNAr on the pentafluoroaryl groups is also demonstated.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>Tuning the Electrochemical Potential of Perfunctionalized Dodecaborate Clusters Through Vertex Differentiation</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Tuning_the_Electrochemical_Potential_of_Perfunctionalized_Dodecaborate_Clusters_Through_Vertex_Differentiation/6187253</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e47:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><updated>1525122000000</updated><published>1525122000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196471</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196471</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196471</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Emma Graham-Clarke</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Graham-Clarke, Alison Rushton, Timothy Noblet, John Marriott&lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Non-medical prescribing has the potential to deliver innovative healthcare within limited finances. However, uptake has been slow, and a proportion of non-medical prescribers do not use the qualification. This systematic review aimed to describe the facilitators and barriers to non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The systematic review and thematic analysis included qualitative and mixed methods papers reporting facilitators and barriers to independent non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom. The following databases were searched to identify relevant papers: AMED, ASSIA, BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, Open Grey, Open access theses and dissertations, and Web of Science. Papers published between 2006 and March 2017 were included. Studies were quality assessed using a validated tool (QATSDD), then underwent thematic analysis. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015019786).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 3991 potentially relevant identified studies, 42 were eligible for inclusion. The studies were generally of moderate quality (83%), and most (71%) were published 2007–2012. The nursing profession dominated the studies (30/42). Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: non-medical prescriber, human factors, and organisational aspects. Each theme consisted of several sub-themes; the four most highly mentioned were ‘medical professionals’, ‘area of competence’, ‘impact on time’ and ‘service’. Sub-themes were frequently interdependent on each other, having the potential to act as a barrier or facilitator depending on circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Addressing the identified themes and subthemes enables strategies to be developed to support and optimise non-medical prescribing. Further research is required to identify if similar themes are encountered by other non-medical prescribing groups than nurses and pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Graham-Clarke, Alison Rushton, Timothy Noblet, John Marriott&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Zoonotic diseases continue to be a public health burden globally. Uganda is especially vulnerable due to its location, biodiversity, and population. Given these concerns, the Ugandan government in collaboration with the Global Health Security Agenda conducted a One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization Workshop to identify zoonotic diseases of greatest national concern to the Ugandan government.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;The One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization tool, a semi-quantitative tool developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was used for the prioritization of zoonoses. Workshop participants included voting members and observers representing multiple government and non-governmental sectors. During the workshop, criteria for prioritization were selected, and questions and weights relevant to each criterion were determined. We used a decision tree to provide a ranked list of zoonoses. Participants then established next steps for multisectoral engagement for the prioritized zoonoses. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated how criteria weights impacted disease prioritization.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-eight zoonoses were considered during the workshop. Criteria selected to prioritize zoonotic diseases were (1) severity of disease in humans in Uganda, (2) availability of effective control strategies, (3) potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic in humans or animals, (4) social and economic impacts, and (5) bioterrorism potential. Seven zoonotic diseases were identified as priorities for Uganda: anthrax, zoonotic influenza viruses, viral hemorrhagic fevers, brucellosis, African trypanosomiasis, plague, and rabies. Sensitivity analysis did not indicate significant changes in zoonotic disease prioritization based on criteria weights.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;One Health approaches and multisectoral collaborations are crucial to the surveillance, prevention, and control strategies for zoonotic diseases. Uganda used such an approach to identify zoonoses of national concern. Identifying these priority diseases enables Uganda’s National One Health Platform and Zoonotic Disease Coordination Office to address these zoonoses in the future with a targeted allocation of resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Musa Sekamatte, Vikram Krishnasamy, Lilian Bulage, Christine Kihembo, Noelina Nantima, Fred Monje, Deo Ndumu, Juliet Sentumbwe, Betty Mbolanyi, Robert Aruho, Winyi Kaboyo, David Mutonga, Colin Basler, Sarah Paige, Casey Barton Behravesh&lt;/p&gt;

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarajan Sambathkumar, Renate Akkerman, Sumitava Dastidar, Philip Roelandt, Manoj Kumar, Manmohan Bajaj, Ana Rita Mestre Rosa, Nicky Helsen, Veerle Vanslembrouck, Eric Kalo, Satish Khurana, Jos Laureys, Conny Gysemans, Marijke M.

The red algal subclass Nemaliophycidae includes both marine and freshwater taxa that contribute to more than half of the freshwater species in Rhodophyta. Given that these taxa inhabit diverse habitats, the Nemaliophycidae is a suitable model for studying environmental adaptation. For this purpose, we characterized plastid genomes of two freshwater species, &lt;i&gt;Kumanoa americana&lt;/i&gt; (Batrachospermales) and &lt;i&gt;Thorea hispida&lt;/i&gt; (Thoreales), and one marine species &lt;i&gt;Palmaria palmata&lt;/i&gt; (Palmariales). Comparative genome analysis identified seven genes (&lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;46, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;91, &lt;i&gt;grx&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A) that were different among marine and freshwater species. Among currently available red algal plastid genomes (127), four genes (&lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37) were retained in most of the marine species. Among these, the &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A gene, known for encoding heme oxygenase, had two additional copies (&lt;i&gt;HMOX1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HMOX2&lt;/i&gt;) that were newly discovered and were reported from previously red algal nuclear genomes. Each type of heme oxygenase had a different evolutionary history and special modifications (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., plastid targeting signal peptide). Based on this observation, we suggest that the plastid-encoded &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A contributes to the iron controlling system in iron-deprived conditions. Thus, we highlight that this functional requirement may have prevented gene loss during the long evolutionary history of red algal plastid genomes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chung Hyun Cho, Ji Won Choi, Daryl W.

Nutrient acquisition is a critical determinant for the competitive advantage for auto- and osmohetero- trophs alike. Nutrient limited growth is commonly described on a whole cell basis through reference to a maximum growth rate (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and a half-saturation constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;). This empirical application of a Michaelis-Menten like description ignores the multiple underlying feedbacks between physiology contributing to growth, cell size, elemental stoichiometry and cell motion. Here we explore these relationships with reference to the kinetics of the nutrient transporter protein, the transporter rate density at the cell surface (&lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;; potential transport rate per unit plasma-membrane area), and diffusion gradients. While the half saturation value for the limiting nutrient increases rapidly with cell size, significant mitigation is afforded by cell motion (swimming or sedimentation), and by decreasing the cellular carbon density. There is thus potential for high vacuolation and high sedimentation rates in diatoms to significantly decrease &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; and increase species competitive advantage. Our results also suggest that &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; for larger non-diatom protists may be constrained by rates of nutrient transport. For a given carbon density, cell size and &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;, the value of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;/K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; remains constant. This implies that species or strains with a lower &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; might coincidentally have a competitive advantage under nutrient limited conditions as they also express lower values of &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;. The ability of cells to modulate the &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt; according to their nutritional status, and hence change the instantaneous maximum transport rate, has a very marked effect upon transport and growth kinetics. Analyses and dynamic models that do not consider such modulation will inevitably fail to properly reflect competitive advantage in nutrient acquisition. This has important implications for the accurate representation and predictive capabilities of model applications, in particular in a changing environment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CoNucHdd8IM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin J.

Prompted by the successful application of in-silico pharmacophore-based virtual screening in lead identification, we have made an effort to implement in-silico protocols to identify novel NMDA receptor antagonist. A series of novel benzo[b]quinolizinium cations as NMDA receptor antagonists have been used as a starting point to develop prognostic pharmacophore models. The most predictive pharmacophore model (hypothesis 1), consisting of four features, namely, one hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic and two ring aromatic, showed a correlation (r) of 0.89, root mean square of 0.259, and the cost difference of 43.01 bits between null and fixed cost. The model was thoroughly validated and subjected to a chemical database search, which lead to the identification of 400 hits from NCI and Maybridge databases which were checked for Lipinski&apos;s violation and predictive potency. This reduced the list to 10 compounds, out of which, two most potent compounds were subjected to molecular docking using Libdock software and interestingly, all the docked conformations showed hydrogen bond interactions with important amino acids Tyr214, His88, Thr174, Val169 and Arg121. In summary, through our validated pharmacophore-based virtual screening protocol, we have identified two potent, structurally diverse, druggable and novel NMDA receptor antagonist which might be of great help to address the unmet medical need of Alzheimer disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>In view of &amp;quot;excitotoxic&amp;quot; effects of glutamate, wherein excessive excitatory input causes increase in intracellular Ca2+ and ultimately cell death, NMDA receptor has emerged as an important target for treatment and prevention of several neurological disorders, like Alzheimer disease. Prompted by the successful application of in-silico pharmacophore-based virtual screening in lead identification, we have made an effort to implement in-silico protocols to identify novel NMDA receptor antagonist. A series of novel benzo[b]quinolizinium cations as NMDA receptor antagonists have been used as a starting point to develop prognostic pharmacophore models.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major mediator of peritoneal fibrosis and reportedly affects expression of the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9. SET7/9-induced H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) critically activates transcription of fibrosis-related genes. In this study, we examined the effect of SET7/9 inhibition on peritoneal fibrosis in mice and in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). We also examined SET7/9 expression in nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Murine peritoneal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) into male C57/BL6 mice over 21 days. Sinefungin, a SET7/9 inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously just before MGO injection (10 mg/kg). SET7/9 expression was elevated in both MGO-injected mice and nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of PD patients. SET7/9 expression was positively correlated with dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine in PD patients. Sinefungin was shown immunohistochemically to suppress expression of mesenchymal cells and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased H3K4me1 levels. Peritoneal equilibration tests showed that sinefungin attenuated the urea nitrogen transport rate from plasma and the glucose absorption rate from the dialysate. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, sinefungin suppressed TGF-β1-induced expression of fibrotic markers and inhibited H3K4me1. These findings suggest that inhibiting the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Tamura, Shigehiro Doi, Ayumu Nakashima, Kensuke Sasaki, Kazuya Maeda, Toshinori Ueno, Takao Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;
The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.

Thirty-eight percent of US adult women are obese, meaning that more children are now born of overweight and obese mothers, leading to an increase in predisposition to several adult onset diseases. To explore this phenomenon, we developed a maternal obesity animal model by feeding mice a diet composed of high fat/ high sugar (HF/HS) and assessed both maternal diet and offspring diet on the development of endometrial cancer (ECa). We show that maternal diet by itself did not lead to ECa initiation in wildtype offspring of the C57Bl/6J mouse strain. While offspring fed a HF/HS post-weaning diet resulted in poor metabolic health and decreased uterine weight (regardless of maternal diet), it did not lead to ECa. We also investigated the effects of the maternal obesogenic diet on ECa development in a Diethylstilbestrol (DES) carcinogenesis mouse model. All mice injected with DES had reproductive tract lesions including decreased number of glands, condensed and hyalinized endometrial stroma, and fibrosis and increased collagen deposition that in some mice extended into the myometrium resulting in extensive disruption and loss of the inner and outer muscular layers. Fifty percent of DES mice that were exposed to maternal HF/HS diet developed several features indicative of the initial stages of carcinogenesis including focal glandular and atypical endometrial hyperplasia versus 0% of their Chow counterparts. There was an increase in phospho-Akt expression in DES mice exposed to maternal HF/HS diet, a regulator of persistent proliferation in the endometrium, and no difference in total Akt, phospho-PTEN and total PTEN expression. In summary, maternal HF/HS diet exposure induces endometrial hyperplasia and other precancerous phenotypes in mice treated with DES. This study suggests that maternal obesity alone is not sufficient for the development of ECa, but has an additive effect in the presence of a secondary insult such as DES.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Theresa O.

Further, weak positive correlations have been observed between gene body 5hmC and gene expression. We previously demonstrated that ME-Class, which uses a high-resolution model of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, is an effective tool to understand relationships between 5mC and expression. In this work, we present ME-Class2, a machine-learning based tool to perform integrative 5mCG, 5hmCG and expression analysis. Using ME-Class2 we analyze whole-genome single-base resolution 5mC and 5hmC datasets from 20 primary tissue and cell samples to uncover relationships between 5hmC and expression. The addition of 5hmC improves model performance for tissues with high-levels of 5hmC such as the brain. Our analysis further indicates that conversion of 5mC to 5hmC within 2kb of the transcription start site associates with distinct functions depending on the summed level of 5mC + 5hmC. Unchanged levels of 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. conversion from 5mC to stable 5hmC) associate with repression. Meanwhile, decreases in 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. 5hmC-mediated demethylation) associate with gene activation. As more large-scale, genome-wide, differential DNA methylation studies become available, tools such as ME-Class2 will prove invaluable to interpret epigenomic data and guide mechanistic studies into the function of 5hmC.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>Since the discovery of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) as a prominent DNA base modification found in mammalian genomes, an emergent question has been what role this mark plays in gene regulation. 5hmC is hypothesized to function as an intermediate in the demethylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and also in reactivation of silenced regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancers.

Nitrogen assimilation and metabolism are essential processes for all living organisms, yet there is still much to be learnt on how they are regulated. The use of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; as a model system has been instrumental not only in identifying conserved regulation mechanisms that control the nitrogen assimilation pathway, but also in understanding how the intracellular nitrogen status regulates metabolic processes of industrial interest such as the synthesis of biolipids. While the genetic regulators that control the nitrogen pathway are successfully being unravelled, other layers of regulation have received less attention. Amino acids, for example, regulate nitrogen assimilation in certain organisms, but their role in Chlamydomonas has not thoroughly been explored. Previous results had suggested that arginine might repress key genes of the nitrogen assimilation pathway by acting within the ammonium negative signalling cascade, upstream of the nitric oxide (NO) inducible guanylate cyclase &lt;i&gt;CYG56&lt;/i&gt;. We tested this hypothesis with a combination of genetic and chemical approaches. Antagonising the effects of arginine with an arginine biosynthesis mutant or with two chemical analogues released gene expression from ammonium mediated repression. The &lt;i&gt;cyg56&lt;/i&gt; and related &lt;i&gt;non1&lt;/i&gt; mutants, which are partially insensitive to ammonium repression, were also partially insensitive to repression by arginine. Finally, we show that the addition of arginine to the medium leads to an increase in intracellular NO. Our data reveal that arginine acts as a negative signal for the assimilation of nitrogen within the ammonium-CYG56 negative signalling cascade, and provide a connection between amino acid metabolism and nitrogen assimilation in microalgae.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by David González-Ballester, Emanuel Sanz-Luque, Aurora Galván, Emilio Fernández, Amaury de Montaigu&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.44; p&amp;lt;0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45–5.62; p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals. A reduction in IFH claims in the ED and a reduction in the number of patients with access to a family physician also suggests inadequate primary care for this population, yet this was not reflected in the follow-up advice offered by ED physicians to patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Bakewell, Sarah Addleman, Garth Dickinson, Venkatesh Thiruganasambandamoorthy&lt;/p&gt;

A reduction in IFH claims in the ED and a reduction in the number of patients with access to a family physician also suggests inadequate primary care for this population, yet this was not reflected in the follow-up advice offered by ED physicians to patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>5f45a0f2</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Use of the emergency department by refugees under the Interim Federal Health Program: A health records review</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197282</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162f6f4196e:65384cd:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1524561615214</crawled><published>1524553200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24413-z</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24413-z</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24413-z</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Haiying Sun</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery can improve clinical outcomes for patients with IB2-IIB cervical cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery can improve clinical outcomes for patients with IB2-IIB cervical cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery, Published online: 24 April 2018;

Neuronal information processing is regulated by fast and localized fluctuations of brain states. Brain states reliably switch between distinct spatiotemporal signatures at a network scale even though they are composed of heterogeneous and variable rhythms at a cellular scale. We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/12Pj_Yzaong&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Drion, Julie Dethier, Alessio Franci, Rodolphe Sepulchre&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively reviewed the evolution of segmentectomy for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and the feasibility of multi- and single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Of 348 patients undergoing surgery for TB, the medical records of 121 patients undergoing segmentectomy between January 1996 and November 2015 were reviewed. Clinical information and computed tomography (CT) image characteristics were investigated and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighteen patients underwent direct or intended thoracotomy. Sixty-four underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy (VATS), including 53 multi-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (MITS), and 11 single-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (SITS). Thirty-nine were converted to thoracotomy. The intended thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and hospital stay (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) than the VATS group although the VATS group had higher grade of cavity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007). The intended thoracotomy group did not differ from converted thoracotomy in operative time, blood loss, or hospital stay, and the grade of pleural thickening was higher in the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). The converted thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss, hospital stay, and complication rate than the MITS group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009, respectively). The MITS group had lower pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, cavity, and tuberculoma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.017, respectively).

Four patients in the intended thoracotomy group and seven in the converted thoracotomy group had complications compared with three patients in the MITS and two in the SITS group.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is known to provide neuroprotective effect in the central nervous system. However, the detailed mechanism remains far more elusive. This study was designed to investigate the relevant mechanisms of DEX&apos;s neuroprotective effect. Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were injected with dexmedetomidine and/or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally, and inflammatory cytokines in serum and in the hippocampus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-κB in the brain tissue extracts was analyzed with western-blot. Then, we investigated whether NF-κB inhibitor prevents the elevation of inflammatory cytokines in rats injected with LPS. Our results indicated that compared with the control group, the rats exposed to LPS showed significant cognitive dysfunction. When compared to controls, the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the serum and hippocampus homogenate were increased in rats treated with LPS. DEX pretreatment inhibited the rats&apos; TNF-α, IL-6 and NF-κB levels induced by LPS. In response to LPS, PDTC pretreatment restrains the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). Rats treated with PDTC and DEX alongside LPS exhibited less TNF-α and IL-6 than the LPS treated group. In combination, PDTC and DEX showed addictive effects. Our data suggest that DEX exerts a neuroprotective effect through NF-κB in part after LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaobao Zhang, Fang Yan, Jiying Feng, Haitao Qian, Zhi Cheng, Qianqian Yang, Yong Wu, Zhibin Zhao, Aimin Li, Hang Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paul G.

Background &lt;p&gt;We aimed to clarify the factors associated with the presentation of erosive esophagitis (EE) symptoms in subjects undergoing health checkups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We utilized baseline data from 7,552 subjects who underwent upper endoscopy for health screening in a prospective, multicenter cohort study. The subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their upper abdominal symptoms and lifestyle. Based on the heartburn and/or acid regurgitation frequency, the EE subjects were stratified into the following three groups: (1) at least one day a week (symptomatic EE [sEE]), (2) less than one day a week (mild symptomatic EE [msEE]), and (3) never (asymptomatic EE [aEE]). Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) were defined according to the Rome III criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1,262 (16.7%) subjects (male 83.8%, mean age 52.6 years) with EE, the proportions of sEE, msEE and aEE were 15.0%, 37.2% and 47.9%, respectively. The sEE group showed significant associations with overlapping EPS (OR: 58.4, 95% CI: 25.2–160.0), overlapping PDS (OR: 9.96, 95% CI: 3.91–26.8), severe hiatal hernia (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.43–4.05), experiencing high levels of stress (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.43–3.40), atrophic gastritis (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.03–2.36) and Los Angeles (LA) grade B or worse (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.12–2.60) in the multivariate analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Approximately one-sixth of EE subjects were symptomatic.

The sEE group showed significant associations with overlapping EPS (OR: 58.4, 95% CI: 25.2–160.0), overlapping PDS (OR: 9.96, 95% CI: 3.91–26.8), severe hiatal hernia (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.43–4.05), experiencing high levels of stress (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.43–3.40), atrophic gastritis (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.03–2.36) and Los Angeles (LA) grade B or worse (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.12–2.60) in the multivariate analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Approximately one-sixth of EE subjects were symptomatic. A multifactorial etiology, including factors unrelated to gastric acid secretion, was associated with the symptom presentation of EE subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>224740a6</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Factors associated with the presentation of erosive esophagitis symptoms in health checkup subjects: A prospective, multicenter cohort study</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196848</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16349504ae2:11dfaa7:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525943388898</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1525935600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04242-4</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04242-4</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04242-4</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Zhou Shi</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diffusion in translucent media&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diffusion in translucent media, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04242-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04242-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Despite the universal nature of diffusion, the behavior of light transport in optically thin media has remained unclear.

Our results indicate that in the presence of conflicting information at retrieval, mPFC 5-HT2aR may facilitate top-down context-guided control over PRH to control the behavioral response and object memory reconsolidation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>5-HT2a receptor in mPFC influences context-guided reconsolidation of object memory in perirhinal cortex</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33746</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85440:93d646dc</id><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><updated>1526590800000</updated><published>1526590800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197731</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197731</link><author><name>Akram El Kateb</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Akram El Kateb, Claudio Stalder, Andres Rüggeberg, Christoph Neururer, Jorge E.

The marine environment in the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia) is severely impacted by phosphate industries. Nowadays, three localities, Sfax, Skhira and Gabes produce phosphoric acid along the coasts of this Gulf and generate a large amount of phosphogypsum as a waste product. The Gabes phosphate industry is the major cause of pollution in the Gulf because most of the waste is directly discharged into the sea without preliminary treatment. This study investigates the marine environment in the proximity of the phosphate industries of Gabes and the coastal marine environment on the eastern coast of Djerba, without phosphate industry. This site can be considered as &amp;quot;pristine&amp;quot; and enables a direct comparison between polluted and “clean” adjacent areas.
Phosphorous, by sequential extractions (SEDEX), Rock-Eval, C, H, N elemental analysis, and stable carbon isotope composition of sedimentary organic matter, X-ray diffraction (qualitative and quantitative analysis) were measured on sediments. Temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were measured on the water close to the sea floor of each station to estimate environmental conditions. These analyses are coupled with video surveys of the sea floor. This study reveals clear differentiations in pollution and eutrophication in the investigated areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akram El Kateb, Claudio Stalder, Andres Rüggeberg, Christoph Neururer, Jorge E.

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can harm the embryonic development and cause life-long consequences in offspring’s health. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of PAE we have used a mouse model of early alcohol exposure, which is based on maternal &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; ingestion of 10% (v/v) ethanol for the first eight days of gestation (GD 0.5–8.5). Owing to the detected postnatal growth-restricted phenotype in the offspring of this mouse model and both prenatal and postnatal growth restriction in alcohol-exposed humans, we focused on imprinted genes &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like growth factor 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Igf2)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Paternally expressed gene 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Peg3)&lt;/i&gt;, which all are known to be involved in embryonic and placental growth and development. We studied the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation level at the &lt;i&gt;Igf2/H19&lt;/i&gt; imprinting control region (ICR), &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; differentially methylated region 1, &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; ICR and &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; ICR in 9.5 embryonic days old (E9.5) embryos and placentas by using MassARRAY EpiTYPER. To determine alcohol-induced alterations globally, we also examined methylation in long interspersed nuclear elements (Line-1) in E9.5 placentas. We did not observe any significant alcohol-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. We explored effects of PAE on gene expression of E9.5 embryos as well as E9.5 and E16.5 placentas by using quantitative PCR. The expression of growth promoter gene &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; was decreased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas. The expression of negative growth controller &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt; was significantly increased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos compared to controls, and conversely, a trend of decreased expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas were observed. Furthermore, increased &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos was also detected. Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi Marjonen, Mia Toivonen, Laura Lahti, Nina Kaminen-Ahola&lt;/p&gt;

To determine alcohol-induced alterations globally, we also examined methylation in long interspersed nuclear elements (Line-1) in E9.5 placentas. We did not observe any significant alcohol-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. We explored effects of PAE on gene expression of E9.5 embryos as well as E9.5 and E16.5 placentas by using quantitative PCR. The expression of growth promoter gene &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; was decreased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas. The expression of negative growth controller &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt; was significantly increased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos compared to controls, and conversely, a trend of decreased expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas were observed. Furthermore, increased &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos was also detected. Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta.</description><fingerprint>de22e66e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Early prenatal alcohol exposure alters imprinted gene expression in placenta and embryo in a mouse model</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_163039db49b:b389e4:a96d255</id><crawled>1524774057115</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01117/20180426/images/medium/jp-2018-01117f_0008.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>284</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1524715200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01117</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01117</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01117</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Cheriyacheruvakkara Owais, Anto James, Chris John, Rama Dhali, Rotti Srinivasamurthy Swathi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01117/20180426/images/medium/jp-2018-01117f_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01117&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Humans have a remarkable ability to simulate the minds of others. How the brain distinguishes between mental states attributed to self and mental states attributed to someone else is unknown. Here, we investigated how fundamental neural learning signals are selectively attributed to different agents. Specifically, we asked whether learning signals are encoded in agent-specific neural patterns or whether a self–other distinction depends on encoding agent identity separately from this learning signal. To examine this, we tasked subjects to learn continuously 2 models of the same environment, such that one was selectively attributed to self and the other was selectively attributed to another agent. Combining computational modelling with magnetoencephalography (MEG) enabled us to track neural representations of prediction errors (PEs) and beliefs attributed to self, and of simulated PEs and beliefs attributed to another agent. We found that the representational pattern of a PE reliably predicts the identity of the agent to whom the signal is attributed, consistent with a neural self–other distinction implemented via agent-specific learning signals. Strikingly, subjects exhibiting a weaker neural self–other distinction also had a reduced behavioural capacity for self–other distinction and displayed more marked subclinical psychopathological traits. The neural self–other distinction was also modulated by social context, evidenced in a significantly reduced decoding of agent identity in a nonsocial control task. Thus, we show that self–other distinction is realised through an encoding of agent identity intrinsic to fundamental learning signals. The observation that the fidelity of this encoding predicts psychopathological traits is of interest as a potential neurocomputational psychiatric biomarker.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/l0SSGSKOA4E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sam Ereira, Raymond J.

&lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&lt;/i&gt; (Bge.) Sok and &lt;i&gt;Cerasus glandulosa&lt;/i&gt; (Thunb.) Lois are economically important fruit-producing shrubs. Although these two species have similar looking fruits, their fruit organic acid contents differ drastically. In this study, we focused on comparing the organic acid content, activity of enzymes gene expression involved in organic acid metabolism in both &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glandulosa&lt;/i&gt; fruits. To investigate the differences of organic acid metabolism in fruits of these two species, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed. Our results showed that temporal changes of two main organic acids exhibited different trends in these two species. Transcriptome sequencing of developing &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glandulosa&lt;/i&gt; fruits systematically revealed 6,594 differentially expressed genes. Compared with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;, the expression levels of 3,469 and 3,125 genes were up- and down-regulated in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glandulosa&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, including one PEPC gene, 12 malic acid metabolism genes, 25 citric acid cycle genes, and 194 NAD/NADP metabolism genes. The correlation analysis and principal component analysis of gene expression, enzymatic activity and organic acid content showed that differences in the expression of genes encoding the NAD-malate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;NAD-MDH&lt;/i&gt;) and NADP-malate enzyme (&lt;i&gt;NADP-ME&lt;/i&gt;) contributed substantially to the observed differences in organic acid accumulation of two species.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutants have been associated with differences in clinical and virological characteristics. Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to alter this process to survive in host cells. In this work, we studied the modulation of autophagy by the replication of HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4, and the naturally occurring mutants BCP and preCore. HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induced accumulation of autophagosomes in hepatoma cells. However, no autophagic protein degradation was observed, indicating a blockage of autophagic flux at later stages. This inhibition of autophagy flux might be due to an impairment of lysosomal acidification in hepatoma cells. Moreover, HBV-mediated autophagy modulation was independent of the viral subgenotypes and enhanced in viruses with BCP and preCore naturally occurring mutations. These results contribute to understand the mechanisms by which different HBV variants contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infections. In addition, this study is the first to describe the role that two highly prevalent naturally occurring mutations exert on the modulation of HBV-induced autophagy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Mercedes Elizalde, Paula Soledad Pérez, Ina Sevic, Daniel Grasso, Alejandro Ropolo, Luciana Barbini, Rodolfo Héctor Campos, María Inés Vaccaro, Diego Martín Flichman&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, this study is the first to describe the role that two highly prevalent naturally occurring mutations exert on the modulation of HBV-induced autophagy.</description><fingerprint>e13f6984</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induces an incomplete autophagic process in hepatocytes: Role of BCP and preCore mutations</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197109</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163819a82de:61571c7:3dd877af</id><crawled>1526887776990</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1526354382000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018434?af=R</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018434?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Joseph M.

There are only few reports regarding the role of lifetime drug or substance use in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of drug or substance exposure on the onset of MS diagnosis. We conducted a population-based incident case control study in Tehran. Cases (n = 547) were 15–50 years old persons with MS identified from the Iranian Multiple Sclerosis Society (IMSS) register during August 7, 2013, and November 17, 2015. Population-based controls (n = 1057) were 15–50 years old and were recruited by random digit telephone dialing. Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighing (IPTW) using two sets of propensity scores (PSs) was used to estimate marginal incidence odds ratios (ORs) for MS contrasting pre-specified substance use. The estimated marginal OR was 6.03 (95% confidence interval: 3.54;10.3, using trimmed weights at the 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of the stabilized weight distribution) in both IPTW analyses comparing lifetime substance use (opioids, cannabis, inhalants, hallucinogens and stimulants) for at least one time monthly during a six-months or longer period vs. no such history of drug use. Subject to limitation of causal claims based on case-control studies, this study suggests that monthly drug or substance use for a period of at least six consecutive months, may increase the risk of MS by factor 3.5 or higher.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ibrahim Abdollahpour, Saharnaz Nedjat, Mohammad Ali Mansournia, Tibor Schuster&lt;/p&gt;

Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithms.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XJmM-iMvR90&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael F.

Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(18)30307-3&quot;&gt;here’s another example&lt;/a&gt; of protein fuzziness, and I can’t say that I’d like to take this one on, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcn4&quot;&gt;Gcn4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MED15&quot;&gt;Med15&lt;/a&gt; are important parts of the the transcriptional machinery in yeast, and this system has many similarities to what’s going on in higher organisms. Gcn4 is a transcription activator, found in large protein complexes where genes are being transcribed, and it has two (disordered) activation domains that recruit all sorts of co-activator proteins. As the paper says, this has long been seen as a case of “acidic blobs” (Gcn4 in this case) and “negative noodles” (proteins like Med15, SAGA, Swi/Snf and many others). Those charge interactions make sense, but not much else does, and the big question has been how these complexes form with any specificity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also been clear, though, that you really need a cloud of these things for transcription. No one single activator-coactivator event is enough. The back half of Med15, for example, has at least three binding domains that can interact with Gcn4, and this sort of multivalency is common. That makes it quite hard to unravel what’s going on in the protein complex, of course. What kind of structure do you have in there? Many of the protein binding regions involved are disordered in the absence of a binding partner, but it’s well known that some of these can form up into very well-defined structures when they encounter each other. Is that what’s happening on a larger scale? Or is it like the situation described in that first paragraph link, where two disordered proteins form a tight interaction &lt;em&gt;while both still remaining disordered&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not quite that latter case, but it’s still disconcerting. This new paper shows that the various protein interaction domains all have low affinity individually (as the more reductionist experiments had shown), and they do not really assemble into something concrete:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our data demonstrate that the presence of multiple binding components leads to a large gain in the affinity of Gcn4-Med15 binding but does not lead to formation of a distinct ordered structure. The functional complex is a dynamic fuzzy ‘‘free-for-all”. . .Our results provide a general model for the mechanism of many activators that functionally bind coactivators with multiple ABDs and demonstrate how multiple weak fuzzy interactions synergize to generate a biologically functional and specific interaction without adopting a unique protein-protein interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. “Dynamic fuzzy free-for-all” is not the kind of environment that I really feel comfortable tossing small molecules into, but I didn’t get any input into this process. Both of the Gcn4 activator domains bind to all of the Med15 activator-binding domains. A lot of fluorescence polarization work, calorimetry, and NMR data establish that Gcn4’s activator domains do indeed take on helical structure when they’re in the presence of a corresponding Med15 domain, but it’s not that this structure is the nailed-down form of the complex. It can, and does, form the exact same sorts of structures with all the others, and there are several ways that the helices (and the proteins in general) can interact. They’re just bumping around in there sampling every possibility, and the sum of those things is (from a distance) a high-affinity, well-defined protein complex. It’s only as you zoom in closer that you realize that it looks more like a live swarm of bees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, not all transcription activators work this way. There are examples known with specific, defined protein-protein interfaces, more the sort of thing we’re used to. But there are also many cases where a single activator seems to pick up a whole list of (seemingly unrelated) partners, and in those cases, this fuzzy combinatorial mechanism could well be the mode of operation. But for a drug discovery guy like me, the next question, behind the scientific curiosity one, is: is there any way we can target or alter these mechanisms to treat disease? Just figuring out which ones you’d want to target is a major job, and figuring out what sort of alteration you’d want is another. But the biggest job of all is at the end: once you’ve found the spot, and you know what you’d like to do, how do you make one of these fuzzballs do what you want? At the moment, I have no idea. But the night is young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The Tasmanian devil (&lt;i&gt;Sarcophilus harrisii)&lt;/i&gt;, the largest extant carnivorous marsupial and endemic to Tasmania, is at the verge of extinction due to the emergence of a transmissible cancer known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). DFTD has spread over the distribution range of the species and has been responsible for a severe decline in the global devil population. To protect the Tasmanian devil from extinction in the wild, our group has focused on the development of a prophylactic vaccine. Although this work has shown that vaccine preparations using whole DFTD tumour cells supplemented with adjuvants can induce anti-DFTD immune responses, alternative strategies that induce stronger and more specific immune responses are required. In humans, heat shock proteins (HSPs) derived from tumour cells have been used instead of whole-tumour cell preparations as a source of antigens for cancer immunotherapy. As HSPs have not been studied in the Tasmanian devil, this study presents the first characterisation of HSPs in this marsupial and evaluates the suitability of these proteins as antigenic components for the enhancement of a DFTD vaccine. We show that tissues and cancer cells from the Tasmanian devil express constitutive and inducible HSP. Additionally, this study suggests that HSP derived from DFTD cancer cells are immunogenic supporting the future development of a HSP-based vaccine against DFTD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cesar Tovar, Amanda L.

Our aims were to quantify and map the plant sub regions of the the Caatinga, that covers 844,453 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is the largest block of seasonally dry forest in South America. We performed spatial analyses of the largest dataset of woody plant distributions in this region assembled to date (of 2,666 shrub and tree species; 260 localities), compared these distributions with the current phytogeographic regionalizations, and investigated the potential environmental drivers of the floristic patterns in these sub regions. Phytogeographical regions were identified using quantitative analyses of species turnover calculated as Simpson dissimilarity index. We applied an interpolation method to map NMDS axes of compositional variation over the entire extent of the Caatinga, and then classified the compositional dissimilarity according to the number of biogeographical sub regions identified a priori using k-means analysis. We used multinomial logistic regression models to investigate the influence of contemporary climatic productivity, topographic complexity, soil characteristics, climate stability since the last glacial maximum, and the human footprint in explaining the identified sub regions. We identified nine spatially cohesive biogeographical sub regions. Current productivity, as indicated by an aridity index, was the only explanatory variable retained in the best model, explaining nearly half of the floristic variability between sub regions. The highest rates of endemism within the Caatinga were in the Core and Periphery Chapada Diamantina sub regions. Our findings suggest that the topographic complexity, soil variation, and human footprint in the Caatinga act on woody plant distributions at local scales and not as determinants of broad floristic patterns. The lack of effect of climatic stability since the last glacial maximum probably results from the fact that a single measure of climatic stability does not adequately capture the highly dynamic climatic shifts the region suffered during the Pleistocene. There was limited overlap between our results and previous Caatinga classifications.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Augusto C. Silva, Alexandre F.

There was limited overlap between our results and previous Caatinga classifications.</description><fingerprint>d2f705ed</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Aridity drives plant biogeographical sub regions in the Caatinga, the largest tropical dry forest and woodland block in South America</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196130</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1632a74c5c2:12f6a41:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525425685954</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25418-4/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25418_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>453</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><published>1525417200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25418-4</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25418-4</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25418-4</originId><engagement>11</engagement><author><name>Petri Peuravaara</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemical shift extremum of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe(&lt;i&gt;aq&lt;/i&gt;) reveals details of hydrophobic solvation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical shift extremum of &amp;lt;sup&gt;129&amp;lt;/sup&gt;Xe(&amp;lt;i&gt;aq&amp;lt;/i&gt;) reveals details of hydrophobic solvation, Published online: 04 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25418-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25418-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Chemical shift extremum of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe(&lt;i&gt;aq&lt;/i&gt;) reveals details of hydrophobic solvation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/slTsr968Szw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemical shift extremum of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe(&lt;i&gt;aq&lt;/i&gt;) reveals details of hydrophobic solvation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical shift extremum of &amp;lt;sup&gt;129&amp;lt;/sup&gt;Xe(&amp;lt;i&gt;aq&amp;lt;/i&gt;) reveals details of hydrophobic solvation, Published online: 04 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25418-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25418-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Chemical shift extremum of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe(&lt;i&gt;aq&lt;/i&gt;) reveals details of hydrophobic solvation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/slTsr968Szw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>794418b9</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Chemical shift extremum of 129Xe(aq) reveals details of hydrophobic solvation</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/slTsr968Szw/s41598-018-25418-4</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406f:2835af05</id><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><updated>1527022800000</updated><published>1527022800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197826</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197826</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197826</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>John Edelsberg</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by John Edelsberg, Derek Weycker, Mark Atwood, Geoffrey Hamilton-Fairley, James R.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5–60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)—Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-Lung&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)—as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT—because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer—are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift). Patients with a negative AABT, and those scheduled for CT surveillance alone, are assumed to have periodic CT screenings to detect rapid growth and thus to have their lung cancers diagnosed—on average—at more advanced stages.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 1,000 patients who have incidentally detected nodules 8–30 mm, have an intermediate-risk of lung cancer, and are evaluated by CT surveillance alone, 95 (9.5%) are assumed to have lung cancer (local, 73.6%; regional, 22.0%; distant, 4.4%). With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 41%/93% (stage shift = 10.8%), although expected costs would be higher by $949,442 ($949 per person), life years would be higher by 53 (0.05 per person), resulting in a cost per life-year gained of $18,029 and a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $24,330. With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 28%/98% (stage shift = 7.4%), corresponding cost-effectiveness ratios would be $18,454 and $24,833.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Under our base-case assumptions, and reasonable variations thereof, using AABT as an aid in the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules who are estimated to be at intermediate risk of lung cancer and are scheduled for CT surveillance alone is likely to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by John Edelsberg, Derek Weycker, Mark Atwood, Geoffrey Hamilton-Fairley, James R.

The highly similar prokaryotic DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (C5-MTases) M.MpeI and M.SssI share the specificity of eukaryotic C5-MTases (5’-CG), and can be useful research tools in the study of eukaryotic DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation. In an effort to improve the stability and solubility of complementing fragments of the two MTases, genes encoding circularly permuted (CP) variants of M.MpeI and M.SssI were created, and cloned in a plasmid vector downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter. MTase activity of the CP variants was tested by digestion of the plasmids with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Eleven of the fourteen M.MpeI permutants and six of the seven M.SssI permutants had detectable MTase activity as indicated by the full or partial protection of the plasmid carrying the cpMTase gene. Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pál Albert, Bence Varga, Nikolett Zsibrita, Antal Kiss&lt;/p&gt;

Transgenic mouse models are indispensable tools to mimic human diseases and analyze the effectiveness of related new drugs. For a long time amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research depended on only a few mouse models that exhibit a very strong and early phenotype, e.g. SOD1 mice, resulting in a short treatment time window. By now, several models are available that need to be characterized to highlight characteristics of each model. Here we further characterized the mThy1-hTDP-43 transgenic mouse model TAR6/6 that overexpresses wild type human TARDBP, also called TDP-43, under control of the neuronal Thy-1 promoter presented by Wils and colleagues, 2010, by using biochemical, histological and behavioral readouts. Our results show that TAR6/6 mice exhibit a strong TDP-43 expression in the hippocampus, spinal cord, hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. Apart from prominent protein expression in the nucleus, TDP-43 protein was found at lower levels in the cytosol of transgenic mice. Additionally, we detected insoluble TDP-43 in the cortex, motoneuron loss, and increased neuroinflammation in the central nervous system of TAR6/6 animals. Behavioral analyses revealed early motor deficits in the clasping- and wire suspension test as well as decreased anxiety in the elevated plus maze.

Transgenic mouse models are indispensable tools to mimic human diseases and analyze the effectiveness of related new drugs. For a long time amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research depended on only a few mouse models that exhibit a very strong and early phenotype, e.g. SOD1 mice, resulting in a short treatment time window. By now, several models are available that need to be characterized to highlight characteristics of each model. Here we further characterized the mThy1-hTDP-43 transgenic mouse model TAR6/6 that overexpresses wild type human TARDBP, also called TDP-43, under control of the neuronal Thy-1 promoter presented by Wils and colleagues, 2010, by using biochemical, histological and behavioral readouts. Our results show that TAR6/6 mice exhibit a strong TDP-43 expression in the hippocampus, spinal cord, hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. Apart from prominent protein expression in the nucleus, TDP-43 protein was found at lower levels in the cytosol of transgenic mice. Additionally, we detected insoluble TDP-43 in the cortex, motoneuron loss, and increased neuroinflammation in the central nervous system of TAR6/6 animals. Behavioral analyses revealed early motor deficits in the clasping- and wire suspension test as well as decreased anxiety in the elevated plus maze. Further motor tests showed differences at later time points compared to non-transgenic littermates, thus allowing the observation of onset and severity of such deficits. Together, TAR6/6 mice are a valuable tool to test new ALS/FTLD drugs that target TDP-43 expression and insolubility, neuroinflammation, motoneuron loss or other TDP-43 related downstream signaling pathways since these mice exhibit a later pathology as previously used ALS/FTLD mouse models.</description><fingerprint>d87eadb</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>mTh1 driven expression of hTDP-43 results in typical ALS/FTLD neuropathological symptoms</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197674</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_16318b6e4c7:cdece:a96d255</id><crawled>1525128029383</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00392/20180430/images/medium/bi-2018-00392b_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>320</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1525060800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00392</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00392</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00392</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Keya Mukherjee, Tamari Narindoshvili, Frank M.

Background &lt;p&gt;While dyslipidemia importantly contributes to increased cardiovascular disease risk among patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), data on lipid patterns among African adults on ART are limited. We describe the prevalence of lipid abnormalities and associated factors in two HIV clinics in Malawi.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2014 and enrolled adult patients at a rural and an urban HIV clinic in Zomba district, Malawi. We recorded patient characteristics, CVD risk factors and anthropometric measurements, using the WHO STEPS validated instrument. Non-fasting samples were taken for determination of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with elevated TC and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;554 patients were enrolled, 50% at the rural HIV clinic, 72.7% were female, the median (IQR) age was 42 years (36–50); 97.3% were on ART, 84.4% on tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz, 17.5% were overweight/obese and 27.8%% had elevated waist/hip ratio. 15.5% had elevated TC, 15.9% reduced HDL-c, 28.7% had elevated TG and 3.8% had elevated TC/HDL-c ratio. Lipid abnormalities were similar in rural and urban patients. Women had significantly higher burden of elevated TC and TG whereas men had higher prevalence of reduced HDL-c. Waist-to-hip ratio was independently associated with elevated TC (aOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.17–3.10, p = 0.01) and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio (aOR = 3.50; 95% CI: 1.38–8.85, p = 0.008). Increasing age was independently associated with elevated TC level (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI 0.51–4.59 for age 31–45; aOR = 3.69, 95% CI 1.24–10.95 for age &gt;45 years vs. ≤30 years; p-trend &amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found a moderate burden of dyslipidemia among Malawian adults on ART, which was similar in rural and urban patients but differed significantly between men and women. High waist-hip ratio predicted elevated TC and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio and may be a practical tool for CVD risk indication in resource limited settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alemayehu Amberbir, Victor Singano, Alfred Matengeni, Zahra Ismail, Gift Kawalazira, Adrienne K.

Overall our data show that &lt;i&gt;H. hammondi&lt;/i&gt; zoites grow as stringently regulated, unique life stages that are distinct from &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; tachyzoites, and implicate stress sensitivity as a potential developmental innovation that increased the flexibility of the &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; life cycle.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>Dissection of the in vitro developmental program of Hammondia hammondi reveals a link between stress sensitivity and life cycle flexibility in Toxoplasma gondii.</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36491</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1630830ae97:c0f4ae:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1524850798231</crawled><published>1524812400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587v3?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/27/294587</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587v3?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Colubri, A.</name></author><content><content>Background: The 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak highlighted the need for rigorous, rapid, and field-deployable tools to enable case management.

Unpasteurized dairy products are known to occasionally harbor &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and have been implicated in recent listeriosis outbreaks and numerous sporadic cases of listeriosis. However, the diversity and virulence profiles of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from these products have not been fully described. Here we report a genomic analysis of 121 &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from milk, milk filters, and milking equipment collected from bovine dairy farms in 19 states over a 12-year period. In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks. Results of this study also demonstrate significant number of strains isolated from dairy farms encode virulence markers associated with severe human disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seon Woo Kim, Julie Haendiges, Eric N.

Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks. Results of this study also demonstrate significant number of strains isolated from dairy farms encode virulence markers associated with severe human disease.</description><fingerprint>d802d536</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Genetic diversity and virulence profiles of &amp;lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&amp;lt;/i&gt; recovered from bulk tank milk, milk filters, and milking equipment from dairies in the United States (2002 to 2014)</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197053</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f233d:2835af05</id><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><updated>1527109200000</updated><published>1527109200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197877</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197877</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Alicia Montesinos-Navarro</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Montesinos-Navarro, Alba Estrada, Xavier Font, Miguel G.

Understanding what determines species’ geographic distributions is crucial for assessing global change threats to biodiversity. Measuring limits on distributions is usually, and necessarily, done with data at large geographic extents and coarse spatial resolution. However, survival of individuals is determined by processes that happen at small spatial scales. The relative abundance of coexisting species (i.e. ‘community structure’) reflects assembly processes occurring at small scales, and are often available for relatively extensive areas, so could be useful for explaining species distributions. We demonstrate that Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) can overcome several challenges to including community structure into studies of species distributions, despite having been little used to date. We hypothesized that the relative abundance of coexisting species can improve predictions of species distributions. In 1570 assemblages of 68 Mediterranean woody plant species we used BNI to incorporate community structure into Species Distribution Models (SDMs), alongside environmental information. Information on species associations improved SDM predictions of community structure and species distributions moderately, though for some habitat specialists the deviance explained increased by up to 15%. We demonstrate that most species associations (95%) were positive and occurred between species with ecologically similar traits. This suggests that SDM improvement could be because species co-occurrences are a proxy for local ecological processes. Our study shows that Bayesian Networks, when interpreted carefully, can be used to include local conditions into measurements of species’ large-scale distributions, and this information can improve the predictions of species distributions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Montesinos-Navarro, Alba Estrada, Xavier Font, Miguel G.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess whether embryonic DNA isolated from blastocyst culture conditioned medium (BCCM) combined with blastocoel fluid (BF) could be used for blastocyst stage non-invasive preimplantation genetic testing for chromosomal aneuploidy (non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening, NIPGS).&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;47 embryos from 35 patients undergoing IVF.&lt;/p&gt; Interventions &lt;p&gt;DNA analysis of combined BCCM plus BF in comparison with trophectoderm (TE) biopsy and/or whole blastocyst (WB)using next generation sequencing (NGS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Embryonic DNA was successfully amplified in 47/47 NIPGS samples (28 frozen-thawed and 19 fresh culture samples) ranging from 6.3 to 44.0 ng/μl. For frozen-thawed embryos, the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample was equivalent between NIPGS vs. TE biopsy, NIPGS vs. WB and TE vs. WB samples taken from the same embryo was 87.5%; 96.4% and 91.7% respectively (P&gt;0.05), and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 99.3%, 99.7% and 99.7%, respectively (P&gt;0.05). In fresh cases (Day 4 to Day 5/6 culture), the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample between NIPGS vs. TE samples taken from the same embryo was 100%, and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 98.2% (P&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A combination of BCCM and BF contains sufficient embryonic DNA for whole genome amplification and accurate aneuploidy screening.

Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours. This might allow a timely administration of a suitable treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Tassinari, Silvia Zannoli, Patrizia Farabegoli, Maria Federica Pedna, Anna Pierro, Antonio Mastroianni, Riccardo Fontan, Luciano Luongo, Giuseppe Sarnataro, Elisa Menegatti, Assunta Caruso, Vittorio Sambri&lt;/p&gt;

An impaired UPR is associated with hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by lipid accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride lipolysis.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is relatively high in the southern regions of China. Yunnan, located in southwestern China, has the highest number of ethnic groups. However, HEV infection in the ethnic population is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the seropositive rate, risk factor, and clinical impact of HEV infection in the ethnic groups of Yunnan. We recruited 1912 individuals from four minority groups in three prefectures of Yunnan province. Epidemiological records on potential risk factors for exposure to HEV and blood biochemical index were analyzed. All the serum samples were tested for anti-HEV IgM/IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the IgM-positive samples were subjected to nested reverse transcription-PCR to detect HEV RNA. Overall, 1273 individuals (66.58%) were positive for anti-HEV IgG, 16 (0.84%) for anti-HEV IgM, and 64 (3.35%) for anti-HEV IgG and IgM both; none of them had detectable HEV RNA. Multivariate analysis revealed a strong statistical association between ethnic origin and HEV IgG seroprevalence. Anti-HEV IgG reactivity in the Hani ethnic (82.3%; 401/487) population was higher than that in the Naxi (71.9%, 340/473), Bulang (65.1%; 302/464), and Wa (60.2%; 294/488) ethnic populations (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Older age and male sex were independently associated with the risk of past HEV infection. Moreover, anti-HEV IgG-positive individuals showed significantly higher levels of total and direct bilirubin and alanine amino transferase but significantly lower levels of globulin and low-density lipoprotein, than the respective levels in anti-HEV IgG-negative individuals. Thus, the seroprevalence of HEV infection is high in the ethnic populations of Yunnan, China. It is therefore necessary to increase the surveillance of specific risk groups and raise awareness about the possible infectious diseases to help limit the HEV transmission here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yue Feng, Yue-Mei Feng, Songmei Wang, Fang Xu, Xuehui Zhang, Chunyue Zhang, Yuanyuan Jia, Wanru Yang, Xueshan Xia, Jianzhong Yin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). The exact influence of ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFL thickness (RNFLT) is unknown and was analysed in a subgroup of the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global peripapillary RNFLT was measured in 3224 eyes of 1973 subjects (49% female) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The association of age, sex, ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFLT was analysed using Pearson correlation coefficient and fitting a linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the univariable analysis highest correlations were found for axial length (r = -0.27), spherical equivalent (r = 0.24), and glaucoma (r = -0.15) (p&amp;lt;0.0001, respectively). Other significant correlations with RNFLT were found for age, sex, intraocular pressure, systemic hypertension and systolic blood pressure, previous eye surgery, cholesterol, homocysteine, history of coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, apnoea, diabetes and alcohol intake, p&amp;lt;0.05, respectively. Body length, body weight, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, history of apoplexy, cognitive function, peripheral artery disease, tinnitus, migraine, nicotine intake, central corneal thickness, and pseudophakia were not significantly correlated with RNFLT. The regression model revealed a significant relationship between RNFLT and age in decades (p&amp;lt;0.02), spherical equivalent (p&amp;lt;0.0001), axial length (p&amp;lt;0.0001), glaucoma (p&amp;lt;0.0001), tinnitus (p = 0.04), apnoea (p = 0.047), homocysteine (p = 0.05) and alcohol intake &gt;10g/d for women and &gt;20g/d for men (p = 0.02). Glaucoma, apnoea, higher homocysteine, higher alcohol intake and higher axial length as well as age were related to decreased RNFLT while higher spherical equivalent or history for tinnitus were related to thicker RNFL.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;RNFLT is related to age, ocular parameters and lifestyle factors. Considering these parameters in normative databases could improve the evaluation of peripapillary RNFLT. It is necessary to evaluate if a reduction of alcohol intake as well as the therapy of apnea or high homocysteine levels could positively influence RNFLT.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julia Lamparter, Irene Schmidtmann, Alexander K.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;tuberous sclerosis complex 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TSC2)&lt;/i&gt;, a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like Growth Factor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-null and &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse &lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt; homolog &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt;, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We extended transcript-level findings to protein level, observing increased Igf2 protein expression and Igf2 secretion by &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. Increased Igf2 expression was not due to epigenetic imprinting, but was partially mediated through the Stat3 pathway and was completely insensitive to rapamycin treatment. An siRNA-mediated decrease of Igf2 resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting presence of an autocrine Igf2/Stat3 amplification cycle in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. In human pulmonary LAM lesions and metastatic cell clusters, high levels of IGF2 were associated with mTORC1 activation. In addition, treatment of three primary IGF2-expressing LAM lung cell lines with rapamycin did not result in IGF2 level changes.

The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contents in the environment have been rising due to human activities. Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels have been shown to affect plant physiology and soil microbes, which may alter the degradation of organic pollutants. Here, we study the effect of eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on PAH accumulation in a paddy soil grown with rice. We collected soil and plant samples after rice harvest from a free-air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment (FACE) system, which had already run for more than 15 years. Our results show that eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased PAH concentrations in the soil, and we link this effect to a shift in soil microbial community structure and function. Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; changed the composition of soil microbial communities, especially by reducing the abundance of some microbial groups driving PAH degradation. Our study indicates that elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels may weaken the self-cleaning ability of soils related to organic pollutants.

The bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (LT) breaks down the peptidoglycan (PG) layer during processes such as cell division. We present here crystal structures of the soluble LT Cj0843 from &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; with and without bulgecin A inhibitor in the active site. Cj0843 has a doughnut shape similar but not identical to that of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; SLT70. The C-terminal catalytic domain is preceded by an L-domain, a large helical U-domain, a flexible linker, and a small N-terminal NU-domain. The flexible linker allows the NU-domain to reach over and complete the circular shape, using residues conserved in the Epsilonproteobacteria LT family. The inner surface of the Cj0843 doughnut is mostly positively charged including a pocket that has 8 Arg/Lys residues. Molecular dynamics simulations with PG strands revealed a potential functional role for this pocket in anchoring the negatively charged terminal tetrapeptide of the PG during several steps in the reaction including homing and aligning the PG strand for exolytic cleavage, and subsequent ratcheting of the PG strand to enhance processivity in degrading PG strands.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jagamya Vijayaraghavan, Vijay Kumar, Nikhil P.

Massive amounts of fake news and conspiratorial content have spread over social media before and after the 2016 US Presidential Elections despite intense fact-checking efforts. How do the spread of misinformation and fact-checking compete? What are the structural and dynamic characteristics of the core of the misinformation diffusion network, and who are its main purveyors? How to reduce the overall amount of misinformation? To explore these questions we built Hoaxy, an open platform that enables large-scale, systematic studies of how misinformation and fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter. Hoaxy captures public tweets that include links to articles from low-credibility and fact-checking sources. We perform &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-core decomposition on a diffusion network obtained from two million retweets produced by several hundred thousand accounts over the six months before the election. As we move from the periphery to the core of the network, fact-checking nearly disappears, while social bots proliferate. The number of users in the main core reaches equilibrium around the time of the election, with limited churn and increasingly dense connections. We conclude by quantifying how effectively the network can be disrupted by penalizing the most central nodes.

Background &lt;p&gt;Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) can cause Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) in immunosuppressed individuals. However, little is known about the association between chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), circulating HHV8 DNA levels, and clinical KS in HIV-1-infected individuals with various malignancies. Therefore, we examined the associations between various malignancies, systemic cancer chemotherapy, T cell phenotypes, and circulating HHV8 DNA in 29 HIV-1-infected participants with concomitant KS or other cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We quantified HHV8 plasma viral loads and cell-associated HHV8 DNA and determined the relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and lymphocyte counts, and markers of early and late lymphocyte activation, proliferation and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in plasma HHV8 DNA levels between baseline and post-chemotherapy time points or with the presence or absence of clinical KS. However, in two participants circulating HHV8 DNA increased following treatment for KS or HSCT for lymphoma,.

Background &lt;p&gt;Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) can cause Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) in immunosuppressed individuals. However, little is known about the association between chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), circulating HHV8 DNA levels, and clinical KS in HIV-1-infected individuals with various malignancies. Therefore, we examined the associations between various malignancies, systemic cancer chemotherapy, T cell phenotypes, and circulating HHV8 DNA in 29 HIV-1-infected participants with concomitant KS or other cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We quantified HHV8 plasma viral loads and cell-associated HHV8 DNA and determined the relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and lymphocyte counts, and markers of early and late lymphocyte activation, proliferation and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in plasma HHV8 DNA levels between baseline and post-chemotherapy time points or with the presence or absence of clinical KS. However, in two participants circulating HHV8 DNA increased following treatment for KS or HSCT for lymphoma,. We observed an approximately 2-log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in plasma HHV8 DNA in an individual with KS and multicentric Castleman disease following rituximab monotherapy. Although individuals with clinical KS had lower mean CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell counts and percentages as expected, there were no significant associations with these factors and plasma HHV8 levels. We identified increased proportions of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing CD69 (P = 0.01 &amp;amp; P = 0.04 respectively), and increased CD57 expression on CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells (P = 0.003) in participants with detectable HHV8.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest there is a complex relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and tissue-based disease in HIV-1 and HHV8 co-infected individuals with various malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>4be7b5ea</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Human Herpes Virus 8 in HIV-1 infected individuals receiving cancer chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197298</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1638723ede1:6bed1e7:93d646dc</id><crawled>1526980668897</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26335-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26335_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>599</width></visual><published>1526972400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Meihong Chen</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26335-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/rMN9sc_wO_s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26335-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/rMN9sc_wO_s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>d92b991f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/rMN9sc_wO_s/s41598-018-26335-2</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636533aab5:3bac2ee:2835af05</id><crawled>1526411274933</crawled><published>1526367600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v2?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/319731</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v2?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Stoney, R.

In this work, we applied the EE‐GMFCC method for calculation of binding affinity of Endonuclease colicin–immunity protein complex. The binding free energy changes between the wild‐type and mutants of the complex calculated by EE‐GMFCC are in good agreement with experimental results. The correlation coefficient (R) between the predicted binding energy changes and experimental values is 0.906 at the B3LYP/6‐31G*‐D level, based on the snapshot whose binding affinity is closest to the average result from the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculation. The inclusion of the QM effects is important for accurate prediction of protein–protein binding affinities. Moreover, the self‐consistent calculation of PB solvation energy is required for accurate calculations of protein–protein binding free energies.

The binding free energy changes between the wild‐type and mutants of the complex calculated by EE‐GMFCC are in good agreement with experimental results. The correlation coefficient (R) between the predicted binding energy changes and experimental values is 0.906 at the B3LYP/6‐31G*‐D level, based on the snapshot whose binding affinity is closest to the average result from the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculation. The inclusion of the QM effects is important for accurate prediction of protein–protein binding affinities. Moreover, the self‐consistent calculation of PB solvation energy is required for accurate calculations of protein–protein binding free energies.

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eli Skeie, Anne Mette Koch, Stig Harthug, Unni Fosse, Kari Sygnestveit, Roy Miodini Nilsen, Randi J.

(I last &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/03/16/the_mysterious_origins_of_the_quinolones&quot;&gt;wrote about them here&lt;/a&gt;, with the various arguments about how they were developed in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for many years now, it’s been increasingly clear that this class of drugs can have some very unwelcome effects in some patients. The most prominent of these is tendon damage, which often showing up as problems with the Achilles tendon, up to outright rupture even months after drug treatment. Other muscle and connective tissue effects have been seen, as well as CNS effects and others. Over the years, the drugs have picked up black-box warnings for these effects, which seems entirely appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do these things happen, though? Any theory has to take into account the fact that the great majority of patients seem tolerate the drugs pretty well, but that suggests that a better knowledge of the mechanism might let you pick out which people shouldn’t take them in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03267-5&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; is a good summary of current research in the area. An intriguing possibility is that the effects are (at least partially) due to mitochondrial damage, likely oxidative stress, and that this might be correlated with patients who do not metabolize the fluoroquinolone scaffold as well as the general population. This might allow levels of the drugs to build up intracellularly, and since mitochondria are always dealing with the effects of their metabolic role, they’re vulnerable to being overloaded. It’s worth remembering that mitochondria have bacteria-like ancestry, so they’re certainly not guaranteed against large antibiotic concentrations. Indeed, bactericidal antibiotics in general &lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/192/192ra85.short&quot;&gt;have been associated&lt;/a&gt; with oxidative damage, an effect that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20625181&quot;&gt;has not gone unnoticed&lt;/a&gt; in drug development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a disturbing part of the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article, though, where some researchers in the field talk about their worries about publishing results that could affect the commercial prospects of widely used drugs. I understand companies wanting to protect themselves against unfounded accusations, and there’s an endless supply of those. This blog allows me a personal look at many of them, and they just keep on coming. But not all reports of trouble with marketed drugs are unfounded – far from it. It’s a black eye for the industry to go after honest researchers reporting their honest results. Every big organization is vulnerable to falling into this sort of overdefensive behavior under pressure, but that means that the effect is well-known enough that it should be guarded against more effectively. We should be better; we should do better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>The fluoroquinolone antibiotics are important drugs indeed – ciprofloxacin is probably the most famous of the bunch, but there’s a whole series of them, and they’re widely used for serious bacterial infections.

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Higaki, Masashi Muramatsu, Akio Matsuda, Kenji Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Satoh, Makoto Michikawa, Shumpei Niida&lt;/p&gt;

Together, the findings reveal that cell signaling pathways mediated by acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation regulate the cytoskeleton, membrane traffic, and RNA binding protein–mediated control of gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>16b662ec</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Integration of protein phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation data sets to outline lung cancer signaling networks</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/531/eaaq1087?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b78:93d646dc</id><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><updated>1526418000000</updated><published>1526418000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197223</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197223</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197223</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Lyn M.

Bandaging of limb wounds in horses leads to formation of exuberant granulation tissue (EGT) that retards healing due to protracted inflammation, aberrant vascularisation and delayed epithelialisation. EGT is not observed if wounds are left undressed or when wounds are on the body. A previous study showed that short-term administration of proteins derived from orf virus dampened inflammation and promoted epithelialisation of open wounds in horses. Here, we investigated the impact of orf virus interleukin-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor-E on the development and resolution of EGT. Excisional wounds were created on the forelimb of four horses, and bandages were maintained until full healing to induce EGT formation. Matching body wounds were created to ensure EGT was limited to the limb, and to differentiate the effects of the viral proteins on normal healing and on EGT formation. Viral proteins or the hydrogel vehicle control were administered topically to site-matched wounds at day 1, with repeat administration at day 8. Wound healing and EGT formation were monitored macroscopically. Wound margin samples were harvested at 2, 7 and 14 days, and at full healing, with histology used to observe epithelialisation, immunofluorescence used to detect inflammatory cells, angiogenesis and cell death, and qPCR to measure expression of genes regulating inflammation and angiogenesis. Limb wounds developed EGT, and exhibited slower healing than body wounds. Viral protein treatment did not accelerate healing at either location nor limit EGT formation in limb wounds. Treatment of limb wounds did however increase epithelialisation and angiogenesis, without dampening inflammatory cell infiltration or gene expression. The healed wounds also had less occlusion and death of blood vessels and fewer epidermal rete ridges following viral protein treatment. These findings indicate that the viral protein treatment does not suppress wound inflammation or EGT formation, but does promote vascular and epidermal repair and EGT resolution.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lyn M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with multiple myeloma included in prospective clinical trials are highly selected and therefore are expected not to be representative of the entire patient population. Additionally recommendations based on literature data and randomized trials are not systematically implemented in all patients. We sought to determine how patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma are currently treated in France.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We performed a nation-wide search using the Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d’Information (PMSI) database which includes anonymous data for all patients hospitalized in France. We identified newly diagnosed cases in 2012 and analyzed the number and duration of hospital stays, coexisting conditions and treatment modalities with data available until the end of 2015. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma was determined for the first time during a hospitalization in France in 2012 in 6,282 patients (3,234 males and 3,048 females). The median age at diagnosis was 74 years (72 in males and 76 in females). A majority (55.3%) of patients were diagnosed and treated in a single heath center, including 37% in a university hospital and 52% in a non-university public hospital. Comorbidities potentially impacting on myeloma treatment were present in 57.5% of patients at diagnosis, and 15% had an associated diagnosis of another neoplasia. Intensive therapies with stem cell transplants were performed in 1033 patients (16% of total), the majority of which were aged less than 65 (881 patients, 85.3%). Stem cell transplants were performed more frequently in males while the distance between the site of residence and the transplant center had no impact on likelihood of receiving a transplant. Only 60% of patients less than 65 years old who were treated for their disease underwent intensification with stem cell transplant within the 4-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A large majority of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma are elderly, in particular females, and not eligible for transplants. Among the patients aged less than 65 and receiving therapy for their disease, 40% do not undergo transplants.

The phytohormones auxin and cytokinin control development and maintenance of plant meristems and stem cell systems. Fluorescent protein reporter lines that monitor phytohormone controlled gene expression programmes have been widely used to study development and differentiation in the model species Arabidopsis, but equivalent tools are still missing for the majority of crop species. Barley (&lt;i&gt;Hordeum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;) is the fourth most abundant cereal crop plant, but knowledge on these important phytohormones in regard to the barley root and shoot stem cell niches is still negligible. We have now analysed the role of auxin and cytokinin in barley root meristem development, and present fluorescent protein reporter lines that allow to dissect auxin and cytokinin signalling outputs in vivo. We found that application of either auxin or cytokinin to barley seedlings negatively impacts root meristem growth. We further established a barley cytokinin reporter, &lt;i&gt;TCSnew&lt;/i&gt;, which revealed significant cytokinin signalling in the stele cells proximal to the QC, and in the differentiated root cap cells. Application of exogenous cytokinin activated signalling in the root stem cell niche. Commonly employed auxin reporters DR5 or DR5v2 failed to respond to auxin in barley. However, analysis of putative auxin signalling targets barley PLETHORA1 (HvPLT1) is expressed in a similar pattern as its orthologue AtPLT1 from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. in the QC and the surrounding cells. Furthermore, the PINFORMED1 (HvPIN1) auxin efflux carrier was found to be expressed in root and shoot meristems, where it polarly localized to the plasma membrane. HvPIN1 expression is negatively regulated by cytokinin and its intracellular localisation is sensitive to brefeldinA (BFA). With this study, we provide the first fluorescent reporter lines as a tool to study auxin and cytokinin signalling and response pathways in barley.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gwendolyn K.

With this study, we provide the first fluorescent reporter lines as a tool to study auxin and cytokinin signalling and response pathways in barley.</description><fingerprint>8e73c12e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Fluorescent reporter lines for auxin and cytokinin signalling in barley (&amp;lt;i&gt;Hordeum vulgare&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196086</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85447:93d646dc</id><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><updated>1526590800000</updated><published>1526590800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><visual><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197795.t001</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>177</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><width>320</width></visual><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197795</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197795</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197795</link><author><name>Karin Lodin</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karin Lodin, Mats Lekander, Jörgen Syk, Kjell Alving, Predrag Petrovic, Anna Andreasson&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karin Lodin, Mats Lekander, Jörgen Syk, Kjell Alving, Predrag Petrovic, Anna Andreasson&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>2ac71c2d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Longitudinal co-variations between inflammatory cytokines, lung function and patient reported outcomes in patients with asthma</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197795</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16384cad8cc:66955f7:3dd877af</id><crawled>1526941276364</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1526972400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26155-4</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26155-4</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26155-4</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jorge T.

Extensive antibiotic use over the years has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health since for many infections antibiotic treatment is no longer effective. Hospitals are focal points for ARB spread. Antibiotic use in hospitals exerts selective pressure, accelerating the spread of ARB. We used an agent-based model to explore the impact of antibiotics on the transmission dynamics and to examine the potential of stewardship interventions in limiting ARB spread in a hospital. Agents in the model consist of patients and health care workers (HCW). The transmission of ARB occurs through contacts between patients and HCW and between adjacent patients. In the model, antibiotic use affects the risk of transmission by increasing the vulnerability of susceptible patients and the contagiousness of colonized patients who are treated with antibiotics. The model shows that increasing the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics increases the rate of acquisition non-linearly. The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic&apos;s impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient&apos;s vulnerability and contagiousness.

Extensive antibiotic use over the years has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health since for many infections antibiotic treatment is no longer effective. Hospitals are focal points for ARB spread. Antibiotic use in hospitals exerts selective pressure, accelerating the spread of ARB. We used an agent-based model to explore the impact of antibiotics on the transmission dynamics and to examine the potential of stewardship interventions in limiting ARB spread in a hospital. Agents in the model consist of patients and health care workers (HCW). The transmission of ARB occurs through contacts between patients and HCW and between adjacent patients. In the model, antibiotic use affects the risk of transmission by increasing the vulnerability of susceptible patients and the contagiousness of colonized patients who are treated with antibiotics. The model shows that increasing the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics increases the rate of acquisition non-linearly. The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic&apos;s impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient&apos;s vulnerability and contagiousness. Methods to measure these impacts of antibiotics should be developed, standardized, and incorporated into drug development programs and approval packages.</description><fingerprint>239aec5f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>The impact of antibiotic use on transmission of resistant bacteria in hospitals: Insights from an agent-based model</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197111</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1636d6c4909:46d2dab:3dd877af</id><crawled>1526549203209</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04379-2/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4379_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>464</width></visual><published>1526540400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04379-2</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04379-2</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04379-2</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Michel Crameri</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MxB is an interferon-induced restriction factor of human herpesviruses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MxB is an interferon-induced restriction factor of human herpesviruses, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04379-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04379-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;MxB is an interferon-induced GTPase that inhibits HIV replication.

Bittersweet (&lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&lt;/i&gt;) is a native Old World member of the nightshade family. This European diploid species can be found from marshlands to high mountainous regions and it is a common weed that serves as an alternative host and source of resistance genes against plant pathogens such as late blight (&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt;). We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of bittersweet, which is 155,580 bp in length and it is characterized by a typical quadripartite structure composed of a large (85,901 bp) and small (18,449 bp) single-copy region interspersed by two identical inverted repeats (25,615 bp). It consists of 112 unique genes from which 81 are protein-coding, 27 tRNA and four rRNA genes. All bittersweet plastid genes including non-functional ones and even intergenic spacer regions are transcribed in primary plastid transcripts covering 95.22% of the genome. These are later substantially edited in a post-transcriptional phase to activate gene functions. By comparing the bittersweet plastid genome with all available Solanaceae sequences we found that gene content and synteny are highly conserved across the family. During genome comparison we have identified several annotation errors, which we have corrected in a manual curation process then we have identified the major plastid genome structural changes in Solanaceae. Interpreted in a phylogenetic context they seem to provide additional support for larger clades. The plastid genome sequence of bittersweet could help to benchmark Solanaceae plastid genome annotations and could be used as a reference for further studies. Such reliable annotations are important for gene diversity calculations, synteny map constructions and assigning partitions for phylogenetic analysis with de novo sequenced plastomes of Solanaceae.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Amiryousefi, Jaakko Hyvönen, Péter Poczai&lt;/p&gt;

Disturbances in one-carbon metabolism, intracellular reactions involved in nucleotide synthesis and methylation, likely increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, results have been inconsistent. To explore whether this inconsistency could be explained by intertumoral heterogeneity, we evaluated a comprehensive panel of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation to the risk of molecular subtypes of CRC defined by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; oncogenes. This nested case-control study included 488 CRC cases and 947 matched controls from two population-based cohorts in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. We analyzed 14 biomarkers and 17 SNPs in prediagnostic blood and determined &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; mutation status in tumor tissue. In a multivariate network analysis, no variable displayed a strong association with the risk of specific CRC subtypes. A non-synonymous SNP in the &lt;i&gt;CTH&lt;/i&gt; gene, rs1021737, had a stronger association compared with other variables. In subsequent univariate analyses, participants with variant rs1021737 genotype had a decreased risk of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.50, 1.05), and an increased risk of &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.07, 2.30), with weak evidence for heterogeneity (P&lt;sub&gt;heterogeneity&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01). This subtype-specific SNP association was not replicated in a case-case analysis of 533 CRC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (P = 0.85). In conclusion, we found no support for clear subtype-specific roles of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and SNPs in CRC development, making differences in CRC molecular subtype distributions an unlikely explanation for the varying results on the role of one-carbon metabolism in CRC development across previous studies.

Background &lt;p&gt;Bedaquiline, an antimycobacterial agent approved for drug-resistant tuberculosis, is metabolized by CYP3A4, an hepatic enzyme strongly induced by rifampin, an essential part of drug-sensitive tuberculosis treatment. We examined the pharmacokinetic interactions of bedaquiline plus either rifampin or rifabutin in 33 healthy volunteers. This sub-study of that trial examined the mycobactericidal activity of these drugs against intracellular &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; whole blood culture.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subjects were randomly assigned to receive two single 400 mg doses of bedaquiline, alone, and, after a 4 week washout period, in combination with steady-state daily dosing of either rifabutin 300 mg or rifampin 600 mg. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and at multiple time points subsequently, to measure plasma drug concentrations and bactericidal activity in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo M tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;-infected whole blood cultures (WBA).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Single oral doses of bedaquiline produced readily detectable WBA &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;, reaching a maximal effect of -0.28 log/day, with negative values indicating bacterial killing. Plasma concentrations of 355 ng/ml were sufficient for intracellular mycobacteriostasis. Combined dosing with rifampin or rifabutin produced maximal effects of -0.91 and -0.79 log/d, respectively. However, the activity of the rifabutin combination was sustained throughout the dosing interval, thereby producing a greater cumulative or total effect. At low drug concentrations, rifabutin plus bedaquiline yielded greater mycobactericidal activity than the sum of their separate effects. Neither drug metabolites nor cellular drug accumulation could account for this observation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of rifabutin plus bedaquiline produces sustained intracellular mycobactericidal activity that is greater than the sum of their individual effects.

Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective human hair growth–modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth–promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non–immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-d2BFNTwPU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan J.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a cornerstone in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Yet, prolonged GC use is hampered by deleterious GC-related side effects and the emergence of GC resistance. To tackle and overcome these GC-related problems, the applicability of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators was studied, in search of fewer side-effects and at least equal therapeutic efficacy as classic GCs. Compound A (CpdA) is a prototypical example of such a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator and does not support GR-mediated transactivation. Here, we examined whether the combination of CpdA with the classic GC dexamethasone (Dex) may improve GC responsiveness of MM and ALL cell lines. We find that the combination of Dex and CpdA does not substantially enhance GC-mediated cell killing. In line, several apoptosis hallmarks, such as caspase 3/7 activity, PARP cleavage and the levels of cleaved-caspase 3 remain unchanged upon combining Dex with CpdA. Moreover, we monitor no additional inhibition of cell proliferation and the homologous downregulation of GR is not counteracted by the combination of Dex and CpdA. In addition, CpdA is unable to modulate Dex-liganded GR transactivation and transrepression, yet, Dex-mediated transrepression is also aberrant in these lymphoid cell lines. Together, transrepression-favoring compounds, alone or combined with GCs, do not seem a valid strategy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dorien Clarisse, Karlien Van Wesemael, Jan Tavernier, Fritz Offner, Ilse M.

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.
