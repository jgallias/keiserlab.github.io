Objective &lt;p&gt;Although severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis-related diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no reliable biomarker of CAD risks in patients with OSA. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1-Abs) are associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-two adults diagnosed with OSA by polysomnography, 96 patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 64 healthy volunteers (HVs) were consecutively enrolled. Serum samples were collected from patients with OSA at diagnostic polysomnography and from patients with ACS at disease onset. Serum NBL1-Ab level was measured by amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay and its association with clinical variables related to atherosclerosis was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;NBL1-Ab level was significantly elevated in patients with both OSA and ACS compared with HVs. Subgroup analyses showed that NBL1-Ab level was markedly higher in patients with severe OSA and OSA patients with a history of CAD. Weak associations were observed between NBL1-Ab level and apnea-hypopnea index, age, mean SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and arousal index, whereas significantly higher NBL1-Ab levels were observed in OSA patients with a history of CAD than in those without a history of CAD. Sensitivity analysis using a logistic regression model also demonstrated that increased NBL1-Ab levels were associated with the previous history of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Elevated NBL1-Ab levels may be associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA, which needs to be confirmed further.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Takuma Matsumura</name></author><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takuma Matsumura, Jiro Terada, Taku Kinoshita, Yoriko Sakurai, Misuzu Yahaba, Kenji Tsushima, Seiichiro Sakao, Kengo Nagashima, Toshinori Ozaki, Yoshio Kobayashi, Takaki Hiwasa, Koichiro Tatsumi&lt;/p&gt;

Dromedaries are capable of digesting plant cell wall with high content of lignocellulose of poor digestibility. Consequently, their intestinal microbiota can be a source of novel carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). To the best of our knowledge, no data are available describing the biochemical analysis of enzymes in dromedary intestinal microbiota. To investigate new hydrolytic enzymes from the dromedary gut, a fosmid library was constructed using metagenomic DNA from feces of non-domestic adult dromedary camels living in the Tunisian desert. High-throughput functional screening of 13756 clones resulted in 47 hit clones active on a panel of various chromogenic and non-chromogenic glycan substrates.

Dromedaries are capable of digesting plant cell wall with high content of lignocellulose of poor digestibility. Consequently, their intestinal microbiota can be a source of novel carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). To the best of our knowledge, no data are available describing the biochemical analysis of enzymes in dromedary intestinal microbiota. To investigate new hydrolytic enzymes from the dromedary gut, a fosmid library was constructed using metagenomic DNA from feces of non-domestic adult dromedary camels living in the Tunisian desert. High-throughput functional screening of 13756 clones resulted in 47 hit clones active on a panel of various chromogenic and non-chromogenic glycan substrates. Two of them, harboring multiple activities, were retained for further analysis. Clone 26H3 displayed activity on AZO-CM-cellulose, AZCL Carob galactomannan and Tween 20, while clone 36A23 was active on AZCL carob galactomannan and AZCL barley β-glucan.

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore. The course aimed at introducing biological problems as well as some of the quantitative approaches commonly used when tackling those problems. We have run the course for three years with over 100 students attending. Building on this experience, we share 11 quick tips on how to run such an effective, interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students in the biosciences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lgYLCd2q9tA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Timothy E.

Hypovitaminosis D has been extensively documented in critically ill humans. However, whether or not critically ill dogs have alterations in vitamin D concentrations remains unconfirmed. The primary aims of our study were to compare serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] concentrations in critically ill dogs with healthy control dogs, determine the prognostic utility of serum 25(OH)D concentration as a biomarker in critically ill dogs, and to assess if serum 25(OH)D concentrations in critically ill dogs are associated with length of stay in the intensive care unit or illness severity. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D together with a range of other clinical, biochemical, and hematological parameters, were measured in 99 dogs within 24 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Critically ill dogs (P = 0.001) and dogs with sepsis (P = 0.002) had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy control dogs. In addition, serum 25(OH)D concentration was an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30 day survival. Using a cut-off of 33 ng/mL, serum 25(OH)D concentrations had excellent sensitivity (0.94; 95% CI, 0.71–1.00), but poor specificity (0.41; 95% CI, 0.31–0.53) for detection of survival. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLE) fast score but were not associated with ICU length of stay. Hospitalized dogs with critical illness have decreased serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy dogs and can be used to predict survival in this cohort.</content></content><author><name>Jared A.

Hypovitaminosis D has been extensively documented in critically ill humans. However, whether or not critically ill dogs have alterations in vitamin D concentrations remains unconfirmed.

Several studies suggest that low birthweight resulting from restricted intrauterine growth can leave a metabolic footprint which may persist into adulthood. To investigate this, we performed metabolomic profiling on 5036 female twins, aged 18–80, with weight at birth information available from the TwinsUK cohort and performed independent replication in two additional cohorts. Out of 422 compounds tested, 25 metabolites associated with birthweight in these twins, replicated in 1951 men and women from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS, aged 66) and in 2391 men and women from the North Finland Birth 1986 cohort (NFBC, aged 16). We found distinct heterogeneity between sexes and, after adjusting for multiple tests and heterogeneity, two metabolites were reproducible overall (propionylcarnitine and 3-4-hydroxyphenyllactate). Testing women only, we found other metabolites associated with lower birthweight from the meta-analysis of the three cohorts (2-hydroxy-butyric acid and γ-glutamylleucine). Higher levels of all these metabolites can be linked to insulin resistance, oxidative stress or a dysfunction of energy metabolism, suggesting that low birthweight in both twins and singletons are having an impact on these pathways in adulthood.</content></content><author><name>Sarah Jane Metrustry</name></author><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah Jane Metrustry, Ville Karhunen, Mark H.

In the process of hybrid seed production, Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (OguCMS), controlled by the mitochondrial gene &lt;i&gt;orf138&lt;/i&gt;, has been extensively used for cabbage hybrid production with complete and stable male sterility. To identify the critical genes and pathways involved in the sterility and to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, the anther of OguCMS line R2P2CMS and the fertile line R2P2 were used for RNA-seq and iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) proteome analysis. RNA-seq analysis generated 13,037,109 to 13,066,594 SE50-clean reads, from the sterile and fertile lines, which were assembled into 36,890 unigenes. Among them, 1,323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, consisting of 307 up- and 1016 down-regulated genes. For ITRAQ analysis, a total of 7,147 unique proteins were identified, and 833 were differentially expressed including 538 up- and 295 down-regulated proteins. These were mainly annotated to the ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA surveillance pathways. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified 22 and 70 genes with the same and opposite expression profiles, respectively. Using KEGG analysis of DEGs, gibberellin mediated signaling pathways regulating tapetum programmed cell death and four different pathways involved in sporopollenin synthesis were identified. Secretion and translocation of the sporopollenin precursors were identified, and the key genes participating in these pathways were all significantly down-regulated in R2P2CMS. Light and transmission electron (TE) microscopy revealed fat abnormal tapetum rather than vacuolization and degradation at the tetrad and microspore stages of the OguCMS line. This resulted in the failed deposition of sporopollenin on the pollen resulting in sterility.

Despite the important role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) secretion from astrocytes in brain lipid metabolism and the strong association of apoE4, one of the human apoE isoforms, with sporadic and late onset forms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) little is known about the regulation of astrocytic apoE. Utilizing annotated chemical libraries and a phenotypic screening strategy that measured apoE secretion from a human astrocytoma cell line, inhibition of pan class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) was identified as a mechanism to increase apoE secretion. Knocking down select HDAC family members alone or in combination revealed that inhibition of the class I HDAC family was responsible for enhancing apoE secretion. Knocking down LXRα and LXRβ genes revealed that the increase in astrocytic apoE in response to HDAC inhibition occurred via an LXR-independent pathway.

Background &lt;p&gt;Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a leading cause of premature mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Women of reproductive age are a unique and vulnerable group of RHD patients, due to increased risk of cardiovascular complications and death during pregnancy. Yet, less than 5% of women of childbearing age with RHD in LMICs use contraceptives, and one in five pregnant women with RHD take warfarin despite known teratogenicity. It is unclear whether this suboptimal contraception and anticoagulant use during pregnancy is due to lack of health system resources, limited health literacy, or social pressure to bear children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a mixed methods study of 75 women living with RHD in Uganda. Questionnaires were administered to 50 patients. Transcripts from three focus groups with 25 participants were analyzed using qualitative description methodology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Several themes emerged from the focus groups, including pregnancy as a calculated risk; misconceptions about side-effects of contraceptives and anticoagulation; reproductive decision-making control by male partners, in-laws, or physicians; abandonment of patients by male partners; and considerable stigma against heart disease patients for both their reproductive and financial limitations (often worse than that directed against HIV patients). All questionnaire respondents were told by physicians that their hearts were not strong enough to support a pregnancy. Only 14% used contraception while taking warfarin. All participants felt that society would look poorly on a woman who cannot have children due to a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study of female RHD patients and their attitudes toward cardiovascular disorders and reproduction. Our results suggest that health programs targeting heart disease in LMICs must pay special attention to the needs of women of childbearing age. There are opportunities for improved family/societal education programs and community engagement, leading to better outcomes and patient empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Andrew Y.

In the context of an ageing population, understanding the transmission of infectious diseases such as scabies through well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases. Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods for the integration of the differential equation system, and then select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We test the goodness-of-fit of this model using posterior predictive intervals and propagate forward the resulting parameter uncertainty in a Bayesian framework to consider the economic cost of delayed interventions against scabies, quantifying the benefits of prompt action in the event of detection. We also revisit the previous methodology used to assess the safety of treatments in small population sub-units—in this context ivermectin—and demonstrate that even a very slight relaxation of the implicit assumption of homogeneous death rates significantly increases the plausibility of the hypothesis that ivermectin does not cause excess mortality based upon the data of Barkwell and Shields [1].&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UwFpGqUcNck&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Timothy Kinyanjui</name></author><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Timothy Kinyanjui, Jo Middleton, Stefan Güttel, Jackie Cassell, Joshua Ross, Thomas House&lt;/p&gt;

Consequently, the HR frequency was over 46% with very short homology regions (50 bp): the &lt;i&gt;pex10&lt;/i&gt; gene was accurately deleted at a frequency of 60% and the β-carotene biosynthetic genes were integrated at the correct locus at an average frequency of 53%. For repeated use, the URA3 marker gene was also excised and deleted at a frequency of 100% by HR between the 100 bp homology regions flanking the URA3 gene.

Cancer affects 39.6% of Americans at some point during their lifetime. Solid tumor microenvironments are characterized by a disorganized, leaky vasculature that promotes regions of low oxygenation (hypoxia). Tumor hypoxia is a key predictor of poor treatment outcome for all radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy and surgery procedures, and is a hallmark of metastatic potential. In particular, the radiation therapy dose needed to achieve the same tumor control probability in hypoxic tissue as in normoxic tissue can be up to 3 times higher. Even very small tumors (&amp;lt;2–3 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) comprise 10–30% of hypoxic regions in the form of chronic and/or transient hypoxia fluctuating over the course of seconds to days. We investigate the potential of recently developed lipid-stabilized oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) to improve the therapeutic ratio of RT. OMBs, but not nitrogen microbubbles (NMBs), are shown to significantly increase dissolved oxygen content when added to water in vitro and increase tumor oxygen levels in vivo in a rat fibrosarcoma model. Tumor control is significantly improved with OMB but not NMB intra-tumoral injections immediately prior to RT treatment and effect size is shown to depend on initial tumor volume on RT treatment day, as expected.</content></content><author><name>Samantha M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Disturbance of intestinal wound closure leads to insufficient anastomotic healing and is associated with considerable morbidity following colorectal resections. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in regulation of wound closure. Here fluorescence endoscopy was evaluated for assessment of MMP-2/-9 expression during failed intestinal anastomotic healing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Distal colonic anastomoses were performed as a model for disturbed healing in 36 Balb/c mice. Healing was evaluated endoscopically, macroscopically, and histologically after 1, 3 and 5 days. For detection of MMP-2/-9 expression fluorescence endoscopy (FE) was used following &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;administration of a Cy5.5-labeled MMP-2/-9 specific tracer. FE was complemented by quantification of the fluorescence signal using the MS-FX PRO Optical Imaging System. An overall leakage score was calculated and correlated with the results of FE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;With increasing incidence of anastomotic leakage from POD1 (17%) to POD5 (83%) the uptake of the MMP tracer gradually increased (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), POD1: 17.91 ± 1.251 vs. POD3: 30.56 ± 3.03 vs. POD5: 44.8 ± 4.473, P&amp;lt;0.0001). Mice with defective anastomotic healing showed significantly higher uptake compared to non-defective (SNR: 37.37± 3.63 vs. 26.16± 3.635, P = 0.0369). White light endoscopy and FE allowed evaluation of anastomotic healing and visualization of mucosal MMPs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using FE based detection of MMPs in the anastomosis, an overall positive predictive value of 71.4% and negative predictive value of 66.6% was calculated for detection of anastomotic leakage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;During disturbed anastomotic healing increased expression of MMP-2/-9 was observed in the anastomotic tissue.

Abstract &lt;p&gt;The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a species detection tool is attracting attention from both scientific and applied fields, especially for detecting invasive or rare species. In order to use eDNA as an efficient and reliable tool, however, we need to understand its origin and state as well as factors affecting its degradation. Various biotic and abiotic environmental factors have been proposed to affect degradation of eDNA in aquatic environments and thus to influence detection rates of species. Here, we were interested in two of them, namely UV light, which can break down DNA, and the presence of filter feeders, which can remove DNA and DNA-bound particles. A few, mostly laboratory-based studies have found minor effects of UVB on the degradation of eDNA. Ultraviolet A radiation (UVA), however, has been neglected although it also causes DNA lesions and is 10- to 100-fold more prevalent than UVB when reaching the earth’s surface. Filter feeders are common in aquatic ecosystem, but their effects on eDNA has hitherto been ignored. We conducted a full-factorial aquatic mesocosm experiment under near-natural outdoor conditions manipulating UV radiation as well as the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dreissena polymorpha&lt;/i&gt;, a strong filter feeder capable of filtering cells or organelles containing DNA. Surprisingly, we found that neither UV radiation nor the presence of the filter feeder affected eDNA-based detection rates of macroinvertebrates, even though the experiment took place in summer when UV radiation intensity and filtration activity is high for the chosen experimental site and conditions. These results, in combination with studies from marine or laboratory settings finding no effect of sunlight and its UV components on the detectability of eDNA, suggest that eDNA based species assessments could be relatively robust with respect to our two factors studied.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Elvira Mächler</name></author><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elvira Mächler, Maslin Osathanunkul, Florian Altermatt&lt;/p&gt;

Terrestrial plants can harbor endophytic fungi that may induce changes in plant physiology that in turn affect interactions with herbivorous insects. We evaluated whether the application of entomopathogenic fungi &lt;i&gt;Beauveria bassiana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium brunneum&lt;/i&gt; to soybean seeds could become endophytic and affect interactions with soybean aphid (&lt;i&gt;Aphis glycines&lt;/i&gt; Matsumura). It was found that &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glycines&lt;/i&gt; population sizes increased on plants with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brunneum&lt;/i&gt; (strain F52) seed inoculum, but no significant effects were shown with analogous treatments with &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; (strain GHA). Fungi recovered from soybean plant tissues indicate that endophytism was established, and that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; was more prevalent. &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium brunneum&lt;/i&gt; was only recovered from stems, but &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; was recovered from stems and leaves. This work confirms that some entomopathogenic fungi can be endophytic in soybean, however, some of these fungi may have a negative effect on the plants by increasing susceptibility of soybean to &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glycines&lt;/i&gt;. We also used DNA sequence data to identify species of &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium&lt;/i&gt; obtained from agricultural fields in Iowa. Phylogenetic analyses, based on DNA sequence data, found that all isolates were &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium robertsii&lt;/i&gt;, which is consistent with past studies indicating a cosmopolitan distribution and wide host range for this species.

Background &lt;p&gt;In patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction is frequent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

&lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; is a perennial herbaceous plant species mainly distributed in the tropics or subtropics of Asia and Africa. It has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time and now is utilized for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agriculture industries as a valued economic crop. Recently, &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; has attracted tremendous interest because of its high ceramide content. However, the breeding and genome studies are severely limited by the arduous whole genome sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, the transcriptome data of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by utilizing the high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. Based on this information, the majority of the significant genes involved in the proposed sphingolipid metabolic pathway were identified. Then, the full-length neutral ceramidase cDNA was obtained with the help of its candidate transcripts, which were acquired from the transcriptome data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this neutral ceramidase was a real ceramidase by eukaryotic expression in the yeast double knockout mutant Δypc1 Δydc1, which lacks the ceramidases—dihydroCDase (YDC1p), phytoCDase (YPC1p). In addition, the biochemical characterization of purified &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; ceramidase (AmCDase) exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an optimal activity ranging from pH 6.5 to 8.0.

However, the quality of any prediction based on molecular dynamics results will strongly depend on the validity of underlying physical assumptions.
Unphysical behavior of simulations can have significant influence on the results and reproducibility of these simulations, such as folding of proteins and DNA or properties of lipid bilayers determined by cutoff treatment, dynamics of peptides and polymers affected by the choice of thermostat, or liquid properties depending on the simulation time step. Motivated by such examples, we propose a two-fold approach to increase the robustness of molecular simulations. The first part of this approach involves tests which can be performed by the users of MD programs on their respective systems and setups. We present a number of tests of different complexity, ranging from simple post-processing analysis to more involved tests requiring additional simulations. These tests are shown to significantly increase the reliability of MD simulations by catching a number of common simulation errors violating physical assumptions, such as non-conservative integrators, deviations from the Boltzmann ensemble, and lack of ergodicity between degrees of freedom. To make the usage as easy as possible, we have developed an open-source and platform-independent Python library (https://physical-validation.readthedocs.io) implementing these tests.
The second part of the approach involves testing for code correctness. While unphysical behavior can be due to poor or incompatible choices of parameters by the user, it can just as well originate in coding errors within the program. We therefore propose to include physical validation tests in the code-checking mechanism of MD software packages. We have implemented such a validation for the GROMACS software package, ensuring that every major releases passes a number of physical sanity checks performed on selected representative systems before shipping. It is, to our knowledge, the first major molecular mechanics software package to run such validation routinely. The tests are, as the rest of the package, open source software, and can be adapted for other software packages.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Testing_for_Physical_Validity_in_Molecular_Simulations/6005279</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1521590400000</published><description>Advances in recent years have made molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations powerful tools in molecular-level research, allowing the prediction of experimental observables in the study of systems such as proteins, membranes, and polymeric materials.

These tests are shown to significantly increase the reliability of MD simulations by catching a number of common simulation errors violating physical assumptions, such as non-conservative integrators, deviations from the Boltzmann ensemble, and lack of ergodicity between degrees of freedom. To make the usage as easy as possible, we have developed an open-source and platform-independent Python library (https://physical-validation.readthedocs.io) implementing these tests.
The second part of the approach involves testing for code correctness. While unphysical behavior can be due to poor or incompatible choices of parameters by the user, it can just as well originate in coding errors within the program. We therefore propose to include physical validation tests in the code-checking mechanism of MD software packages. We have implemented such a validation for the GROMACS software package, ensuring that every major releases passes a number of physical sanity checks performed on selected representative systems before shipping. It is, to our knowledge, the first major molecular mechanics software package to run such validation routinely. The tests are, as the rest of the package, open source software, and can be adapted for other software packages.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23866-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>NMR Structure, Dynamics and Interactions of the Integrin β2 Cytoplasmic Tail with Filamin Domain IgFLNa21</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23866-6</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1628acdc610:9385a9a:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23866-6/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23866_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>344</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23866-6</originId><published>1522738800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9c640b7a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/qtmstXoKsWE/s41598-018-23866-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NMR Structure, Dynamics and Interactions of the Integrin β2 Cytoplasmic Tail with Filamin Domain IgFLNa21&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMR Structure, Dynamics and Interactions of the Integrin β2 Cytoplasmic Tail with Filamin Domain IgFLNa21, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23866-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23866-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;NMR Structure, Dynamics and Interactions of the Integrin β2 Cytoplasmic Tail with Filamin Domain IgFLNa21&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/qtmstXoKsWE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Deepak Chatterjee</name></author><crawled>1522747164176</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NMR Structure, Dynamics and Interactions of the Integrin β2 Cytoplasmic Tail with Filamin Domain IgFLNa21&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMR Structure, Dynamics and Interactions of the Integrin β2 Cytoplasmic Tail with Filamin Domain IgFLNa21, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23866-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23866-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;NMR Structure, Dynamics and Interactions of the Integrin β2 Cytoplasmic Tail with Filamin Domain IgFLNa21&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/qtmstXoKsWE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><title>Simple mechanosense and response of cilia motion reveal the intrinsic habits of ciliates [Microbiology]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3231.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:635228c:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/13/3231/F1.medium.gif</url><width>440</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>313</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3231</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3231.short?rss=1</originId><published>1522168914000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>82a915ca</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3231.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>An important habit of ciliates, namely, their behavioral preference for walls, is revealed through experiments and hydrodynamic simulations.

Spatial heterogeneity in the strength or agents of selection can lead to geographic variation in ecologically important phenotypes. Many dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid toxins from their diets and often exhibit fixed mutations at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, a voltage-gated sodium ion channel associated with alkaloid toxin resistance. Yet previous studies have noted an absence of resistance mutations in individuals from several species known to sequester alkaloid toxins, suggesting possible intraspecific variation for alkaloid resistance in these species. Toxicity and alkaloid profiles vary substantially between populations in several poison frog species (genus &lt;i&gt;Dendrobates&lt;/i&gt;) and are correlated with variation in a suite of related traits such as aposematic coloration. If resistance mutations are costly, due to alterations of channel gating properties, we expect that low toxicity populations will have reduced frequencies and potentially even the loss of resistance alleles. Here, we examine whether intraspecific variation in toxicity in three dendrobatid frogs is associated with intraspecific variation in alleles conferring toxin resistance. Specifically, we examine two species that display marked variation in toxicity throughout their native ranges (&lt;i&gt;Dendrobates pumilio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granuliferus&lt;/i&gt;) and one species with reduced toxicity in its introduced range (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auratus&lt;/i&gt;).

Background &lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease of unknown etiology in which genetic factors contribute to development of disease. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multidrug resistance 1 (&lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt;) gene encoding transporter P-glycoprotein have been associated with IBD, but their role in disease susceptibility remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of three &lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms, C1236T (rs1128503), G2677T/A (rs2032582) and C3435T (rs1045642), with Serbian IBD patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 206 IBD patients, 107 Crohn&apos;s disease (CD) and 99 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 255 healthy controls were included in the study. All subjects were genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Comparisons between the groups were performed using the Pearson Chi-square test. False discovery rate according to Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Carriers of T allele of all three &lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt; SNPs were more common in UC patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting predisposing role of T allele of these SNPs in UC pathogenesis. Consistently, TT genotype of C1236T and TTT haplotype were also found more frequently in UC patients. On the other hand, C allele and CC genotype of C1236T and C3435T, as well as G allele and GG genotype of G2677T/A were more frequent in healthy subjects, implying protective role of these variants in UC. Likewise, CGC haplotype and CGC/CGC diplotype were more frequent in controls. Contrary to UC, no statistical difference was observed between CD patients and controls in any of the SNPs analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;MDR1&lt;/i&gt; gene variants and haplotypes were associated with UC in Serbian IBD patients, further supporting their potential role in susceptibility to UC.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Dragana Mijac</name></author><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dragana Mijac, Irena Vukovic-Petrovic, Vera Mijac, Vladimir Perovic, Natasa Milic, Srdjan Djuranovic, Daniela Bojic, Dragan Popovic, Djordje Culafic, Miodrag Krstic, Goran Jankovic, Vera Pravica, Milos Markovic&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was aimed at a serial evaluation and comparison of the prognostic values of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores for neurologic outcomes in comatose, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors, treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analysed a prospective cohort of comatose OHCA patients, with TTM, admitted to an emergency intensive care unit (ICU), between January 2010 and December 2015. SOFA and APACHE II scores were calculated initially, and then at day 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after ICU admission. Primary and secondary outcomes were the 28-day neurologic outcome and the 28-day mortality, respectively. Prognostic value of the SOFA and APACHE II scores was analysed using the receiver operating characteristic curve.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 143 selected patients, 62 survived and 34 had good neurologic outcomes at day 28. There was no significant difference in the SOFA and extracerebral SOFA scores between the good and poor neurologic outcome groups. However, the APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the good outcome group; they displayed good discriminatory power in predicting poor outcomes, unlike the SOFA scores. The APACHE II score at day 3 had the highest prognostic value for predicting poor neurologic outcomes with an area under the cure of 0.793, and with a cut-off value of 20, the APACHE II score predicted poor neurologic outcomes with a sensitivity of 43.75%, a specificity of 94.12%, a positive predictive value of 94.59%, and a negative predictive value of 41.56%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Identifying APACHE II score might assist as one piece of multimodal prognostic approach for the assessment of neurologic outcomes in OHCA survivors treated with TTM.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jae Chol Yoon</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Chol Yoon, Youn-Jung Kim, You-Jin Lee, Seung Mok Ryoo, Chang Hwan Sohn, Dong-Woo Seo, Yoon-Seon Lee, Jae Ho Lee, Kyoung Soo Lim, Won Young Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Competitive pressure to maximize the current bibliometric measures of productivity is jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific literature. Efforts are underway to address the ‘reproducibility crisis’ by encouraging the use of more rigorous, confirmatory methods. However, as long as productivity continues to be defined by the number of discoveries scientists publish, the impact factor of the journals they publish in and the number of times their papers are cited, they will be reluctant to accept high quality methods and consistently conduct and publish confirmatory/replication studies. This exploratory study examined a sample of rigorous Phase II-IV clinical trials, including unpublished studies, to determine if more appropriate metrics and incentives can be developed. The results suggest that rigorous procedures will help reduce false positives, but to the extent that higher quality methods are accepted as the standard of practice, the current bibliometric incentives will discourage innovative studies and encourage scientists to shift their research to less informative studies of subjects that are already being more actively investigated. However, the results also suggest that it is possible to develop a more appropriate system of rewards. In contrast to the current bibliometric incentives, evaluations of the quality of the methods and reproducibility of the results, innovation and diversity of thought, and amount of information produced may serve as measures and incentives that maintain the integrity of the scientific literature and maximize scientific progress.</content></content><author><name>Mark D.

Human protection policies require favorable risk–benefit judgments prior to launch of clinical trials. For phase I and II trials, evidence for such judgment often stems from preclinical efficacy studies (PCESs). We undertook a systematic investigation of application materials (investigator brochures [IBs]) presented for ethics review for phase I and II trials to assess the content and properties of PCESs contained in them. Using a sample of 109 IBs most recently approved at 3 institutional review boards based at German Medical Faculties between the years 2010–2016, we identified 708 unique PCESs. We then rated all identified PCESs for their reporting on study elements that help to address validity threats, whether they referenced published reports, and the direction of their results. Altogether, the 109 IBs reported on 708 PCESs. Less than 5% of all PCESs described elements essential for reducing validity threats such as randomization, sample size calculation, and blinded outcome assessment. For most PCESs (89%), no reference to a published report was provided. Only 6% of all PCESs reported an outcome demonstrating no effect. For the majority of IBs (82%), all PCESs were described as reporting positive findings. Our results show that most IBs for phase I/II studies did not allow evaluators to systematically appraise the strength of the supporting preclinical findings. The very rare reporting of PCESs that demonstrated no effect raises concerns about potential design or reporting biases. Poor PCES design and reporting thwart risk–benefit evaluation during ethical review of phase I/II studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lvi8iDwsCE0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Susanne Wieschowski</name></author><crawled>1522950975641</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Wieschowski, William Wei Lim Chin, Carole Federico, Sören Sievers, Jonathan Kimmelman, Daniel Strech&lt;/p&gt;

The assessment of competitive movement demands in team sports has traditionally relied upon global positioning system (GPS) analyses presented as fixed-time epochs (e.g., 5–40 min). More recently, presenting game data as a rolling average has become prevalent due to concerns over a loss of sampling resolution associated with the windowing of data over fixed periods. Accordingly, this study compared rolling average (ROLL) and fixed-time (FIXED) epochs for quantifying the peak movement demands of international rugby union match-play as a function of playing position. Elite players from three different squads (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 119) were monitored using 10 Hz GPS during 36 matches played in the 2014–2017 seasons. Players categorised broadly as forwards and backs, and then by positional sub-group (FR: front row, SR: second row, BR: back row, HB: half back, MF: midfield, B3: back three) were monitored during match-play for peak values of high-speed running (&gt;5 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; HSR) and relative distance covered (m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) over 60–300 s using two types of sample-epoch (ROLL, FIXED). Irrespective of the method used, as the epoch length increased, values for the intensity of running actions decreased (e.g., For the backs using the ROLL method, distance covered decreased from 177.4 ± 20.6 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 60 s epoch to 107.5 ± 13.3 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the 300 s epoch). For the team as a whole, and irrespective of position, estimates of fixed effects indicated significant between-method differences across all time-points for both relative distance covered and HSR. Movement demands were underestimated consistently by FIXED versus ROLL with differences being most pronounced using 60 s epochs (95% CI HSR: -6.05 to -4.70 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 95% CI distance: -18.45 to -16.43 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For all HSR time epochs except one, all backs groups increased more (p &amp;lt; 0.01) from FIXED to ROLL than the forward groups. Linear mixed modelling of ROLL data highlighted that for HSR (except 60 s epoch), SR was the only group not significantly different to FR. For relative distance covered all other position groups were greater than the FR (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The FIXED method underestimated both relative distance (~11%) and HSR values (up to ~20%) compared to the ROLL method. These differences were exaggerated for the HSR variable in the backs position who covered the greatest HSR distance; highlighting important consideration for those implementing the FIXED method of analysis. The data provides coaches with a worst-case scenario reference on the running demands required for periods of 60–300 s in length. This information offers novel insight into game demands and can be used to inform the design of training games to increase specificity of preparation for the most demanding phases of matches.</content></content><author><name>Daniel J.

While there is substantial evidence that adults who violate gender stereotypes often face backlash (i.e. social and economic penalties), less is known about the nature of gender stereotypes for young children, and the penalties that children may face for violating them. We conducted three experiments, with over 2000 adults from the US, to better understand the content and consequences of adults’ gender stereotypes for young children. In Experiment 1, we tested which characteristics adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 635) believed to be descriptive (i.e. typical), prescriptive (i.e. required), and proscriptive (i.e. forbidden) for preschool-aged boys and girls. Using the characteristics that were rated in Experiment 1, we then constructed vignettes that were either ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’, and manipulated whether the vignettes were said to describe a boy or a girl. Experiment 2 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 697) revealed that adults rated stereotype-violating children as less likeable than their stereotype-conforming peers, and that this difference was more robust for boys than girls. Experiment 3 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 731) was a direct replication of Experiment 2, and revealed converging evidence of backlash against stereotype-violating children. In sum, our results suggest that even young children encounter backlash from adults for stereotype violations, and that these effects may be strongest for boys.</content></content><author><name>Jessica Sullivan</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Sullivan, Corinne Moss-Racusin, Michael Lopez, Katherine Williams&lt;/p&gt;

Polarity establishment, the spontaneous generation of asymmetric molecular distributions, is a crucial component of many cellular functions. &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; (yeast) undergoes directed growth during budding and mating, and is an ideal model organism for studying polarization. In yeast and many other cell types, the Rho GTPase Cdc42 is the key molecular player in polarity establishment. During yeast polarization, multiple patches of Cdc42 initially form, then resolve into a single front. Because polarization relies on strong positive feedback, it is likely that the amplification of molecular-level fluctuations underlies the generation of multiple nascent patches. In the absence of spatial cues, these fluctuations may be key to driving polarization. Here we used particle-based simulations to investigate the role of stochastic effects in a Turing-type model of yeast polarity establishment. In the model, reactions take place either between two molecules on the membrane, or between a cytosolic and a membrane-bound molecule. Thus, we developed a computational platform that explicitly simulates molecules at and near the cell membrane, and implicitly handles molecules away from the membrane. To evaluate stochastic effects, we compared particle simulations to deterministic reaction-diffusion equation simulations. Defining macroscopic rate constants that are consistent with the microscopic parameters for this system is challenging, because diffusion occurs in two dimensions and particles exchange between the membrane and cytoplasm. We address this problem by empirically estimating macroscopic rate constants from appropriately designed particle-based simulations. Ultimately, we find that stochastic fluctuations speed polarity establishment and permit polarization in parameter regions predicted to be Turing stable. These effects can operate at Cdc42 abundances expected of yeast cells, and promote polarization on timescales consistent with experimental results. To our knowledge, our work represents the first particle-based simulations of a model for yeast polarization that is based on a Turing mechanism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ccfBadz21A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Michael Pablo</name></author><crawled>1520877508959</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Pablo, Samuel A.

Our findings demonstrate that integrated statistical modelling of whole imaging data is computationally feasible and can provide novel biological insights.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Fresh red blood cells transfusion protects against aluminum phosphide-induced metabolic acidosis and mortality in rats</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193991</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad280c:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193991</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193991</originId><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1c28be8d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193991</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nastaran Rahimi, Amir Hossein Abdolghaffari, Alireza Partoazar, Nina Javadian, Tara Dehpour, Ali R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Aluminum phosphide (AlP) is used as pesticide in some countries for protection of stored grains. Human poisoning with AlP due to suicide attempt or accidental environmental exposure is associated with very high mortality partially due to development of severe metabolic acidosis. Previous studies have shown that hemoglobin has high buffering capacity and erythrocytes can potentially be used for management of metabolic acidosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fresh packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion on survival and cardiovascular function in AlP-poisoned rats.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Rats were poisoned with AlP by gavage. Fresh packed RBC was transfused via tail vein after AlP administration. Acid-base balance, vital signs and mortality was assessed and compared in experimental groups. Infusion of fresh packed RBC (1.5 ml) one hour after AlP (4–15 mg/kg) intoxication was associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate. Packed RBC infusion improved blood pH, HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. Plasma troponin level was also reduced and ECG changes were reversed following packed RBC infusion in AlP intoxicated rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our results showed that fresh RBC transfusion could ameliorate metabolic acidosis and enhance survival in AlP-poisoned rat. We assume that an increase in pool of RBCs may modulate acid-base balance or potentially chelate AlP-related toxic intermediates via phosphine-hemoglobin interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nastaran Rahimi</name></author><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nastaran Rahimi, Amir Hossein Abdolghaffari, Alireza Partoazar, Nina Javadian, Tara Dehpour, Ali R.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether lyophilized human platelet lysate (HPL) powder can preserve the growth factor concentrations and epitheliotrophic properties of liquid HPL, and potentially be used as a clinically-friendly treatment option.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two commercialized liquid HPLs, UltraGRO TM (Helios, Atlanta, GA) and PLTMax (Mill Creek, Rochester, MI), were obtained and converted to lyophilized powder. After redissolution, lyophilized powder HPLs were compared with liquid HPLs, as well as human peripheral serum (HPS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) in liquid or redissolved lyophilized powder forms. Concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human corneal epithelial cell line was incubated with the blood derivatives and evaluated for cell migration with scratch-induced directional wounding and proliferation with MTS assays. Cell differentiation was examined by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Fluorescein staining and in vivo confocal microscopy were used to evaluate in vivo corneal epithelial wound healing in Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent corneal debridement and topical application of liquid and redissolved powder HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liquid form and redissolved lyophilized powder form HPLs had similar concentrations of EGF, TGF-β1, PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments on cell migration, proliferation and differentiation and rat models on wound healing demonstrated no significant difference between the liquid and redissolved lyophilized powder forms for HPLs, HPS and FBS. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; confocal microscopy revealed similar wound healing process at different layers of cornea after corneal epithelial debridement between liquid form and redissolved lyophilized power form of HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The redissolved lyophilized powder form of both commercialized HPLs showed similar growth factor concentrations and corneal epitheliotrophic abilities compared to the liquid form.

Results suggest that the properties of liquid HPLs can be retained despite lyophilization and that lyophilized HPLs can be a treatment option for corneal epithelial disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23192-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Waist circumference is a mediator of dietary pattern in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23192-x</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1623dc6ab95:2526e3a:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23192-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23192_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>161</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23192-x</originId><published>1521442800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>da315331</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/pcGdZhWjmXU/s41598-018-23192-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waist circumference is a mediator of dietary pattern in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waist circumference is a mediator of dietary pattern in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23192-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23192-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Waist circumference is a mediator of dietary pattern in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/pcGdZhWjmXU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Alireza Ghaemi</name></author><crawled>1521454853013</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waist circumference is a mediator of dietary pattern in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waist circumference is a mediator of dietary pattern in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23192-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23192-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Waist circumference is a mediator of dietary pattern in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/pcGdZhWjmXU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>A new scheme for strain typing of methicillin-resistant &amp;lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;lt;/i&gt; on the basis of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry by using machine learning approach</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194289</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d6a:9f3b30f2</id><fingerprint>c17343d</fingerprint><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194289</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194289</originId><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><updated>1520974800000</updated><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194289</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hsin-Yao Wang, Tzong-Yi Lee, Yi-Ju Tseng, Tsui-Ping Liu, Kai-Yao Huang, Yung-Ta Chang, Chun-Hsien Chen, Jang-Jih Lu&lt;/p&gt;
Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA), one of the most important clinical pathogens, conducts an increasing number of morbidity and mortality in the world. Rapid and accurate strain typing of bacteria would facilitate epidemiological investigation and infection control in near real time. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a rapid and cost-effective tool for presumptive strain typing. To develop robust method for strain typing based on MALDI-TOF spectrum, machine learning (ML) is a promising algorithm for the construction of predictive model. In this study, a strategy of building templates of specific types was used to facilitate generating predictive models of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) strain typing through various ML methods. The strain types of the isolates were determined through multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the predictive accuracy of the models were compared. ST5, ST59, and ST239 were the major MLST types, and ST45 was the minor type. For binary classification, the AUC values of various ML methods ranged from 0.76 to 0.99 for ST5, ST59, and ST239 types. In multiclass classification, the predictive accuracy of all generated models was more than 0.83. This study has demonstrated that ML methods can serve as a cost-effective and promising tool that provides preliminary strain typing information about major MRSA lineages on the basis of MALDI-TOF spectra.</content></content><author><name>Hsin-Yao Wang</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hsin-Yao Wang, Tzong-Yi Lee, Yi-Ju Tseng, Tsui-Ping Liu, Kai-Yao Huang, Yung-Ta Chang, Chun-Hsien Chen, Jang-Jih Lu&lt;/p&gt;

We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErL2lgBM7O0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Laurent Dollé</name></author><crawled>1523296582770</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurent Dollé, Ricardo Chavarriaga, Agnès Guillot, Mehdi Khamassi&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Strength training improves distance running economy and performance. This finding is based predominantly on maximal and explosive strength programmes applied to locomotor muscles, particularly on the lower limbs. It is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic cost (C&lt;sub&gt;met&lt;/sub&gt;) and an improvement in running performance is feasible with strength training of the postural and trunk muscles.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using kinematic, neuromuscular and metabolic measurements of running at two different speeds before and after a 12-week Pilates training programme, we tested the hypothesis that core training might improve the running C&lt;sub&gt;met&lt;/sub&gt; and performance of trained runners. Thirty-two individuals were randomly assigned to the control group (CG, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) or the Pilates group (PG, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Confirming our hypothesis, a significant improvement (p&amp;lt;0.05) was observed for running performance in the PG (pre: 25.65±0.4 min; post: 23.23±0.4 min) compared to the CG (pre: 25.33±0.58 min; post: 24.61±0.52 min).

This paper presents a switching PD-based sliding mode control (PD-SMC) method for the 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) hovering motion of the underwater robot with tilting thrusters. Four thrusters of robot can be tilted simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical directions, and the 6-DOF motion is achieved by switching between two thruster configurations. Therefore, the tilting speed of thruster becomes the most essential parameter to determine the stability of hovering motion. Even though the previous PD control ensures stable hovering motion within a certain ranges of tilting speed, a PD-SMC is suggested in this paper by combining PD control with sliding mode control in order to achieve acceptable hovering performance even at the much lower tilting speeds. Also, the sign function in the sliding mode control is replaced by a sigmoid function to reduce undesired chattering. Simulations show that while PD control is effective only for tilting duration of 600 ms, the PD-based sliding mode control can guarantee the stable hovering motion of underwater robot even for the tilting duration of up to 1500 ms. Extensive experimental results confirm the hovering performance of the proposed PD-SMC method is much superior to that of PD method for much larger tilting durations.</content></content><author><name>Sangrok Jin</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sangrok Jin, Jeongae Bak, Jongwon Kim, TaeWon Seo, Hwa Soo Kim&lt;/p&gt;

We show that these algorithms increase comparability within large datasets of spectra, facilitating comparative analysis, such as machine learning.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23510-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Regulation of IL-22BP in psoriasis</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23510-3</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162525f15c6:45d6b3d:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23510-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23510_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>548</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23510-3</originId><published>1521788400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>84fc9428</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/NSPDBt3ejEQ/s41598-018-23510-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regulation of IL-22BP in psoriasis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulation of IL-22BP in psoriasis, Published online: 23 March 2018;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;This study was designed to assess the mechanical properties of two calcium carbonate tempers, limestone and burnt shell. These tempers have been previously compared, in separate studies, to silicate-based grit or sand temper and, relative to the latter, are assumed to possess similar mechanical properties. However, their simultaneous use at the Morrison Village site begs the question: do these two calcium carbonate tempers indeed possess similar mechanical properties? In order to assess their performance characteristics, a side-by-side controlled experimental test was conducted to determine the degree of similarity in providing increased vessel strength and toughness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Standardized ceramic test samples were systematically prepared via a set, explicit protocol. An Instron Series IX universal testing machine configured with a four-point flexural test jig was used to perform a flexural strength test of the test samples. The Instron load and deflection data were used to calculate three values related to mechanical performance: &lt;i&gt;peak load&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;modulus of rupture&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;modulus of elasticity&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All four comparative tests clearly show substantial differences in &lt;i&gt;peak load&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;modulus of rupture&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;modulus of elasticity&lt;/i&gt;. These differences are statistically significant for each performance attribute in every iteration of the experiment and as indicated by Mann-Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; Tests.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results do not support the hypothesis that limestone and burnt shell offer the same performance characteristics. These results have implications for our understanding of prehistoric human selection of temper and the evolution of ceramic technology. Although both carbonate-based tempers are currently thought to offer the same benefits during the initial phase of pottery production, their contrasting post firing properties would have provided distinct benefits in different contexts. Future assessments of the Morrison Village ceramic assemblage should focus on residue analysis, or other functional indicators, to support or falsify this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Michelle Rae Bebber</name></author><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michelle Rae Bebber, Linda B.

Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment, but limited studies focused on the association of socioeconomic status (SES) with hearing loss among adults of working age. This paper aimed to fill this gap among Chinese adults. We obtained data from Ear and Hearing Disorder Survey conducted in four provinces of China in 2014–2015. The survey was based on WHO Ear and Hearing Disorders Survey Protocol and 25,860 adults aged 25 to 59 years were selected in this study. Trained local examiners performed pure tone audiometry to screen people with hearing loss, and those who were screened positively for hearing loss were referred to audiologists to make final diagnosis. SES was measured by occupation, education and income. Results show after adjusting for SES measures and covariates, in urban areas, compared with white-collar workers, blue-collar workers and the unemployed were more likely to have hearing loss, with an odds ratio of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0, 1.3) and 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0, 1.4), respectively. Compared with people with education of senior high school or above, those with junior high school, primary school and illiteracy had 1.6 (95%CI: 1.4, 1.8), 2.1(95%CI: 1.7, 2.5) and 2.6 (95%CI: 1.9, 3.7) times as likely to have hearing loss, respectively. In rural areas, the unemployed had 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0, 2.3) times the risk of hearing loss compared with white-collar workers, and illiterates had 1.6 (95%CI: 1.6, 2.1) times the risk of hearing loss compared with people with education of senior high school or above, after SES variables and covariates were taken into considerations. Income was not significantly associated with hearing loss in urban and rural areas. In conclusion, SES, in the form of occupation and education, was associated with hearing loss among working-aged population, and further studies are needed to explore the mechanism of such association.</content></content><author><name>Ping He</name></author><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ping He, Yanan Luo, Xiangyang Hu, Rui Gong, Xu Wen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Aim &lt;p&gt;Long-term care systems may alleviate caregiver burdens, particularly for those with fewer resources. However, it remains unclear whether socioeconomic disparity in caregiver burdens exists under a public, universal long-term care insurance (LTCI) system. This study examined income-based inequalities in caregiving time and depressive symptoms in Japanese older family caregivers. We further compared inequality in depressive symptoms with that of non-caregivers to evaluate whether family caregiving exacerbates this disparity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, nationwide survey conducted by the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study in 2013. Participants were functionally independent older adults aged ≥65 years (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 21,584). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatrics Depression Scale (GDS); caregiving hours per week, household income, and other covariates were also assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Family caregivers occupied 8.3% of the total. A Poisson regression model revealed that caregivers in lower income groups (compared to those in the highest) were 1.32 to 1.95 and 1.63 to 2.68 times more likely to engage in ≥36 and ≥72 hours/week of caregiving, respectively. As for the GDS (≥5), an excess risk was found in the caregivers in lower (compared to higher) income groups (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.57–3.10). However, an interaction effect of income by caregiving role indicated no significant difference in inequality between caregivers and non-caregivers (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .603). The excess risk for GDS (≥5) in the caregivers compared to non-caregivers was observed across income groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed a possible disparity in family caregivers under the public LTCI system. Further studies should examine factors associated with longer caregiving hours in lower income households. Our findings also suggest the necessity for more efforts to alleviate depressive symptoms in family caregivers under the LTCI system regardless of income level, rather than exclusively supporting those with a low income.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Tami Saito</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tami Saito, Naoki Kondo, Koichiro Shiba, Chiyoe Murata, Katsunori Kondo&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings also suggest the necessity for more efforts to alleviate depressive symptoms in family caregivers under the LTCI system regardless of income level, rather than exclusively supporting those with a low income.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03728-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>The ASIC3/P2X3 cognate receptor is a pain-relevant and ligand-gated cationic channel</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03728-5</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162aede3acc:1bca1bb:9aea0a7d</id><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03728-5</originId><published>1523343600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>37789121</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/GrvPDelO2Fc/s41467-018-03728-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ASIC3/P2X3 cognate receptor is a pain-relevant and ligand-gated cationic channel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASIC3/P2X3 cognate receptor is a pain-relevant and ligand-gated cationic channel, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03728-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03728-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Two subclasses of ligand-gated ion channels (ASIC3 and P2X3) are both present at sensory neurons and might be therefore subject to receptor crosstalk.

Super-critical carbon dioxide energy-storage (SC-CCES) technology is a new type of gas energy-storage technology. This paper used orthogonal method and variance analysis to make significant analysis on the factors which would affect the thermodynamics characteristics of the SC-CCES system and obtained the significant factors and interactions in the energy-storage process, the energy-release process and the whole energy-storage system. Results have shown that the interactions in the components have little influence on the energy-storage process, the energy-release process and the whole energy-storage process of the SC-CCES system, the significant factors are mainly on the characteristics of the system component itself, which will provide reference for the optimization of the thermal properties of the energy-storage system.</content></content><author><name>Qing He</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qing He, Yinping Hao, Hui Liu, Wenyi Liu&lt;/p&gt;

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where burden, impact, and incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the highest in the world, conversely, the epidemiology of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is incompletely known. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of influenza-associated SARI in hospitalized children in Maputo city, Mozambique. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children aged 0–14 years old who met the case definition for SARI in two hospitals in Maputo city after their parents or legal representative consented to participate. A structured questionnaire was used to collect clinical and demographic data. Typing and subtyping of influenza were performed by real-time PCR. From January 2014 to December 2016, a total of 2,007 eligible children were recruited, of whom 1,997 (99.5%) were screened for influenza by real-time PCR. The median age of participants was 16.9 months (IQR: 7.0–38.9 months) and 53.9% (1076/1991) were male. A total of 77 were positive for influenza, yielding a frequency of 3.9% (77/1,991), with the highest frequency being reported in the age group 1–5 years old. Cases of influenza peaked twice each year, during which, its frequency reached up to 60%-80%. Among all influenza confirmed cases, 33.7% (26/77), 35.1% (27/77) and 28.6% (22/77) were typed as influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B, respectively. This represents the first report of influenza in urban/sub urban setting in Mozambique and the first evidence of distribution of strains of influenza in the country. Our data showed that frequency of influenza was lower than reported in a rural setting in Mozambique and the frequency of seasonal (A/H1N1pdm09) and (A/H3N2) subtypes were similar in children with SARI.</content></content><author><name>Neuza Nguenha</name></author><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neuza Nguenha, Almiro Tivane, Mirela Pale, Loira Machalele, Afonso Nacoto, Germano Pires, Edirsse Mationane, Judite Salência, Félix Gundane, Délcio Muteto, Josina Chilundo, Sandra Mavale, Noorbebi Adamo, Cynthia Semá-Baltazar, Orvalho Augusto, Eduardo Gudo, Tufária Mussá&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of the study was to develop Tizanidine HCl (TZN) and Meloxicam (MLX) loaded bilayer mucoadhesive films intended for buccal administration, aiming to enhance the bioavailability. Bilayer films were prepared by solvent evaporation technique selecting arabinoxylan (ARX) as a sustained release (SR) layer forming polymer and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) E-15 as an immediate release (IR) layer-forming polymer. Prepared films were subjected to &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug release, surface morphology, mechanical strength, compatibility of the ingredients, drug contents, &lt;i&gt;ex-vivo&lt;/i&gt; mucoadhesion strength and drug permeation. Crossover study design was applied to study the i&lt;i&gt;n-vivo&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetics by using albino rabbits. Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; of both drugs loaded in films were compared with standard solution/dispersion administered to the rabbits at the dose of 1mg/kg. The results unveiled instant release and permeation of MLX from IR layer, while good controlled release and permeation characteristics of TZN from SR films over 8 h. films were of uniform thickness with smooth surface and satisfactory mechanical strength. Mucoadhesion strength was sufficient to provide suitable contact time with mucosal membrane. The pharmacokinetic study exhibited prompt absorption of MLX with better AUC &lt;sub&gt;0-t&lt;/sub&gt; (6655.64 ng/ml*h vs 6538.99 ng/ml*h) and C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (436.98 ng/ml vs 411.33 ng/ml) from oral dispersion.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies has investigated majority influence in nonhuman animals. However, due to both terminological and methodological issues, evidence for conformity in nonhuman animals is scarce and controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that wild birds, wild monkeys, and fish show conformity, that is, forgoing personal information in order to copy the majority. By contrast, chimpanzees seem to lack this tendency. The present study is the first to examine whether dogs (&lt;i&gt;Canis familiaris)&lt;/i&gt; show conformity. Specifically, we tested whether dogs conform to a majority of conspecifics rather than stick to what they have previously learned. After dogs had acquired a behavioral preference via training (i.e., shaping), they were confronted with counter-preferential behavior of either no, one or three conspecifics. Traditional frequentist analyses show that the dogs’ behavior did not differ significantly between the three conditions. Complementary Bayesian analyses suggest that our data provide moderate evidence for the null hypothesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that dogs stick to what they have learned rather than conform to the counter-preferential behavior of others. We discuss the possible statistical and methodological limitations of this finding. Furthermore, we take a functional perspective on conformity and discuss under which circumstances dogs might show conformity after all.</content></content><author><name>Markus Germar</name></author><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Markus Germar, Amira Sultan, Juliane Kaminski, Andreas Mojzisch&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the cost-effectiveness of the elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) regimen in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;This study uses a health economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating previously untreated and treatment experienced chronic hepatitis C patients who have severe and end stage renal disease with the elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen versus no treatment in the French context. The lifetime homogeneous markovian model comprises of forty combined health states including hepatitis C virus and chronic kidney disease. The model parameters were from a multicentre randomized controlled trial, ANRS CO22 HEPATHER French cohort and literature. 1000 Monte Carlo simulations of patient health states for each treatment strategy are used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 95% confidence intervals calculations. The results were expressed in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;The mean age of patients in the HEPATHER French cohort was 59.6 years and 56% of them were men. 22.3% of patients had a F0 fibrosis stage (no fibrosis), 24.1% a F1 stage (portal fibrosis without septa), 7.1% a F2 stage (portal fibrosis with few septa), 21.4% a F3 stage (numerous septa without fibrosis) and 25% a F4 fibrosis stage (compensated cirrhosis). Among these HCV genotype 1 patients, 30% had severe renal impairment stage 4, 33% had a severe renal insufficiency stage 5 and 37% had terminal severe renal impairment stage 5 treated by dialysis.&lt;/p&gt; Intervention &lt;p&gt;Fixed-dose combination of direct-acting antiviral agents elbasvir and grazoprevir compared to no-treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;EBR/GZR increased the number of life years (6.3 years) compared to no treatment (5.1 years) on a lifetime horizon. The total number of QALYs was higher for the new treatment because of better utility on health conditions (6.2 versus 3.7 QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was of €15,212 per QALY gained for the base case analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This cost-utility model is an innovative approach that simultaneously looks at the disease evolution of chronic hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease. EBR/GZR without interferon and ribavirin, produced the greatest benefit in terms of life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in treatment-naïve or experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and stage 4–5 chronic kidney disease including dialysis patients. Based on shape of the acceptability curve, EBR/GZR can be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay of €20,000 /QALY for patients with renal insufficiency with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Franck Maunoury</name></author><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franck Maunoury, Aurore Clément, Chizoba Nwankwo, Laurie Levy-Bachelot, Armand Abergel, Vincent Di Martino, Eric Thervet, Isabelle Durand-Zaleski&lt;/p&gt;

The results were expressed in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;The mean age of patients in the HEPATHER French cohort was 59.6 years and 56% of them were men. 22.3% of patients had a F0 fibrosis stage (no fibrosis), 24.1% a F1 stage (portal fibrosis without septa), 7.1% a F2 stage (portal fibrosis with few septa), 21.4% a F3 stage (numerous septa without fibrosis) and 25% a F4 fibrosis stage (compensated cirrhosis). Among these HCV genotype 1 patients, 30% had severe renal impairment stage 4, 33% had a severe renal insufficiency stage 5 and 37% had terminal severe renal impairment stage 5 treated by dialysis.&lt;/p&gt; Intervention &lt;p&gt;Fixed-dose combination of direct-acting antiviral agents elbasvir and grazoprevir compared to no-treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;EBR/GZR increased the number of life years (6.3 years) compared to no treatment (5.1 years) on a lifetime horizon. The total number of QALYs was higher for the new treatment because of better utility on health conditions (6.2 versus 3.7 QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was of €15,212 per QALY gained for the base case analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This cost-utility model is an innovative approach that simultaneously looks at the disease evolution of chronic hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease. EBR/GZR without interferon and ribavirin, produced the greatest benefit in terms of life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in treatment-naïve or experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and stage 4–5 chronic kidney disease including dialysis patients. Based on shape of the acceptability curve, EBR/GZR can be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay of €20,000 /QALY for patients with renal insufficiency with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Competency model for dentists in China: Results of a Delphi study</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194411</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123927:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1521752400000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194411</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194411</originId><published>1521752400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a9767d9c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194411</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yunxia Geng, Liying Zhao, Yu Wang, Yiyuan Jiang, Kai Meng, Dongxiang Zheng&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;With the increasing awareness of the importance of oral health, patients have an increasing need for integrated care from dentists. In China, the dentistry examination consists of two parts: a practical skills examination and a comprehensive medical examination; to date, no assessment methods that are based on specialized dentistry competencies, unlike the United States, Canada, and other countries, have been established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to construct a competency model for dentists in China in order to guide the development, admission, training and assessment of dentists.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using a literature review, focus group interviews and in-depth personal interviews, a dentist competency index was developed with an expert consultation questionnaire. A panel of 20 specialist experts was chosen from ten national medical universities to carry out two rounds of Delphi expert analysis, using the boundary value method to filter the indicators and the Analytic Hierarchy Process to calculate the weights of the primary indicators.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Two rounds of Delphi results showed that the expert authority, enthusiasm, and coordination coefficients were high. Constructs of the competency model that included seven primary indicators and 62 secondary indicators determined the weight of each index. The seven primary indicators included the following: clinical skills and medical services, disease prevention and health promotion, interpersonal communication skills, core values and professionalism, medical knowledge and lifelong learning ability, teamwork ability and scientific research ability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the use of the Delphi method to construct an initial model of Chinese physician competency is scientific and feasible. The initial competency model conforms to the characteristics and quality requirements of dentists in China and has a strong scientific basis. The dentist competency model should be used in the National Dental Licensing Examination in China.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yunxia Geng</name></author><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yunxia Geng, Liying Zhao, Yu Wang, Yiyuan Jiang, Kai Meng, Dongxiang Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;China is the largest developing country with a relatively developed public health system. To further prevent and eliminate the spread of infectious diseases, China has listed 39 notifiable infectious diseases characterized by wide prevalence or great harm, and classified them into classes A, B, and C, with severity decreasing across classes. Class A diseases have been almost eradicated in China, thus making class B diseases a priority in infectious disease prevention and control. In this retrospective study, we analyze the spatial distribution patterns of 12 class B notifiable infectious diseases that remain active all over China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global and local Moran’s I and corresponding graphic tools are adopted to explore and visualize the global and local spatial distribution of the incidence of the selected epidemics, respectively. Inter-correlations of clustering patterns of each pair of diseases and a cumulative summary of the high/low cluster frequency of the provincial units are also provided by means of figures and maps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 12 most commonly notifiable class B infectious diseases, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis show high incidence rates and account for more than half of the reported cases. Almost all the diseases, except pertussis, exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation at the provincial level. All diseases feature varying spatial concentrations. Nevertheless, associations exist between spatial distribution patterns, with some provincial units displaying the same type of cluster features for two or more infectious diseases. Overall, high–low (unit with high incidence surrounded by units with high incidence, the same below) and high–high spatial cluster areas tend to be prevalent in the provincial units located in western and southwest China, whereas low–low and low–high spatial cluster areas abound in provincial units in north and east China.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Despite the various distribution patterns of 12 class B notifiable infectious diseases, certain similarities between their spatial distributions are present. Substantial evidence is available to support disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions. Regarding provinces that show high–high/high–low patterns of multiple diseases, comprehensive interventions targeting different diseases should be established. As to the adjacent provincial units revealing similar patterns, coordinated actions need to be taken across borders.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Bin Zhu</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bin Zhu, Yang Fu, Jinlin Liu, Ying Mao&lt;/p&gt;

Activation of the amino acid starvation response (AAR) increases lifespan and acute stress resistance as well as regulates inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of AAR pharmacologically by Halofuginone (HF) significantly inhibits production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and provides protection from intestinal inflammation in mice. HF inhibits IL-1β through general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2)–dependent activation of the cytoprotective integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, resulting in rerouting of IL-1β mRNA from translationally active polysomes to inactive ribocluster complexes—such as stress granules (SGs)—via recruitment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) T cell–restricted intracellular antigen-1(TIA-1)/TIA-1–related (TIAR), which are further cleared through induction of autophagy. GCN2 ablation resulted in reduced autophagy and SG formation, which is inversely correlated with IL-1β production. Furthermore, HF diminishes inflammasome activation through suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which IL-1β is regulated by AAR and further suggests that administration of HF might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AhBKSDqeXkQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Srikanth Battu</name></author><crawled>1522950975641</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Srikanth Battu, Sumbul Afroz, Jeevan Giddaluru, Saima Naz, Weishan Huang, Saratchandra Singh Khumukcham, Rafiq Ahmad Khan, SaleemYousuf Bhat, Insaf Ahmed Qureshi, Bramanandam Manavathi, Aleem Ahmed Khan, Avery August, Seyed Ehtesham Hasnain, Nooruddin Khan&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobial peptides represent an alternative to traditional antibiotics that may be less susceptible to bacterial resistance mechanisms by directly attacking the bacterial cell membrane. However, bacteria have a variety of defense mechanisms that can prevent cationic antimicrobial peptides from reaching the cell membrane. The L- and D-enantiomers of the antimicrobial peptide GL13K were tested against the Gram-positive bacteria &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus gordonii&lt;/i&gt; to understand the role of bacterial proteases and cell wall modifications in bacterial resistance. GL13K was derived from the human salivary protein BPIFA2. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by broth dilution and a serial assay used to determine bacterial resistance. Peptide degradation was determined in a bioassay utilizing a luminescent strain of &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; to detect peptide activity. Autolysis and D-alanylation-deficient strains of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gordonii&lt;/i&gt; were tested in autolysis assays and peptide activity assays. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; protease inactivated L-GL13K but not D-GL13K, whereas autolysis did not affect peptide activity.

The mutants regained resistance to L-GL13K whereas bacteria did not gain resistance to D-GL13K after repeated treatment with the peptides. D-alanylation affected the hydrophobicity of bacterial cells but hydrophobicity alone did not affect GL13K activity.

D-GL13K exhibits attractive properties for further antibiotic development.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23409-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Optical Detection of Degraded Therapeutic Proteins</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23409-z</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162525f15c6:45d6b3e:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23409-z/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23409_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>382</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23409-z</originId><published>1521788400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e3ac072e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/JqPZek2SOKw/s41598-018-23409-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optical Detection of Degraded Therapeutic Proteins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optical Detection of Degraded Therapeutic Proteins, Published online: 23 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23409-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23409-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Optical Detection of Degraded Therapeutic Proteins&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/JqPZek2SOKw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>William F.

Background &lt;p&gt;Antenatal depression is associated with adverse maternal and infant well-being. However, compared to postpartum depression, it has been less frequently explored globally or in Jamaica. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, antenatal depressive symptoms among Jamaican women in order to inform policy and build interventions that could improve their management and reduce their negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This secondary analysis of data from the second Jamaican Birth Cohort Study (JA-Kids Birth Cohort) included 3,517 women enrolled during pregnancy. Information was extracted from interviewer-administered questionnaires which recorded social, demographic, medical and obstetric information during pregnancy. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) was used to screen for depression, with scores ≥13 considered indicative of a high likelihood of depression. Bivariate analysis examined associations between depressive symptoms and: age, income, financial difficulties, perceived social support, perceived partner infidelity, previous child-bearing unions and children with the current partner. Obstetric factors were also explored and included gravidity, prior adverse pregnancy outcome and complications from previous pregnancies. Variables that predicted the likelihood of depression based on an EPDS cut score of 13 were evaluated using logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One in five participants (19.6%; 95% CI 18.3–20.9%) had a high likelihood of antenatal depression (EPDS ≥13). Significant predictors of high depressive symptom severity included four indicators of poor perceived social and partner support [ORs (95% CI) ranged from: 1.61 (1.07–2.43); p = 0.024 to 3.14(1.69–5.84); p&amp;lt; 0.001], perceived partner infidelity [1.86 (1.36, 2.54); p&amp;lt;0.001], exposure to violence [2.36 (1.66–3.38); p&amp;lt;0.001] and financial difficulties [1.39 (1.07, 1.80); p = 0.013].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Women’s perceived social and partner support were strongly associated with depressive symptom severity. Within the Jamaican cultural context of unstable reproductive unions, efforts are needed to involve fathers in the antenatal care process to strategically improve the psychological well-being of new mothers which may positively influence long term developmental outcomes for their babies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Omotayo Bernard</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Omotayo Bernard, Roger C.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is not well understood at the molecular level. Exactly why some brain regions produce epileptic discharges and others do not is not known. Patients who fail to respond to antiseizure medication (refractory epilepsy) can benefit from surgical removal of brain regions to reduce seizure frequency. The tissue removed in these surgeries offers an invaluable resource to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of human epilepsy. Here, we report a proteomic study to determine whether there are common proteomic patterns in human brain regions that produce epileptic discharges. We analyzed human brain samples, as part of the Systems Biology of Epilepsy Project (SBEP). These brain pieces are &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized human brain samples withdrawn from the neocortex of six patients with refractory epilepsy. This study is unique in that for each of these six patients the comparison of protein expression was made within the same patient: a more epileptic region was compared to a less epileptic brain region. The amount of epileptic activity was defined for each patient as the frequency of their interictal spikes (electric activity between seizures that is a parameter strongly linked to epilepsy). Proteins were resolved from three subcellular fractions, using a 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), revealing 31 identified protein spots that changed significantly. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was found to be consistently down regulated in high spiking brain tissue and showed a strong negative correlation with spike frequency. We also developed a two-step analysis method to select for protein species that changed frequently among the patients and identified these proteins. A total of 397 protein spots of interest (SOI) were clustered by protein expression patterns across all samples. These clusters were used as markers and this analysis predicted proteomic changes due to both histological differences and molecular pathways, revealed by examination of gene ontology clusters. Our experimental design and proteomic data analysis predicts novel glial changes, increased angiogenesis, and changes in cytoskeleton and neuronal projections between high and low interictal spiking regions. Quantitative histological staining of these same tissues for both the vascular and glial changes confirmed these findings, which provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy.</content></content><author><name>Gal Keren-Aviram</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gal Keren-Aviram, Fabien Dachet, Shruti Bagla, Karina Balan, Jeffrey A.

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Wolfgang Giese</name></author><crawled>1523296582770</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schröder, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

We evaluated the feasibility and safety of nictitating membrane fixation to address reduced contact lens stability by the nictitating membrane in a rabbit model. Under general anesthesia, twelve animals received a horizontal mattress suture between the nictitating membrane and the upper eyelid of one eye. To assess the effects of this technique and secondary side effects, contact lens stability test, Schirmer tear test, tear break-up time measurement, eye tissue pathology and morphology were evaluated. Contact lens stability was increased after nictitating membrane fixation. The percentage of contact lens retention in the nictitating membrane fixed rabbit after 4 hours was 90% whereas that in the untreated rabbit was 42.5%. In addition, there were no significant differences in tear quantity and quality between the fixed and untreated eyes. Furthermore, no remarkable pathological lesions were found in gross observation during the 1-month time period or the following pathological examination. In this study, we demonstrated that nictitating membrane fixation increases contact lens stability without specific side effects using a rabbit model. This minimally invasive procedure could be useful when designing animal models for testing new contact lenses and has potential to apply to other biomaterial research on the ocular surface.</content></content><author><name>J.

This minimally invasive procedure could be useful when designing animal models for testing new contact lenses and has potential to apply to other biomaterial research on the ocular surface.</description></item><item><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25199?af=R</link><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626527cfcb:6cdec:76251cdd</id><unread>False</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25199?af=R</originId><published>1522115530699</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>51f7594d</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25199?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1522115530699</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Signalling maps in cancer research: construction and data analysis [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/089409v2?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1621be21583:65af544:7c9981b6</id><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/12/089409</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/089409v2?rss=1</originId><published>1520838000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ff381eca</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/089409v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Generation and usage of high-quality molecular signalling network maps can be augmented by standardising notations, establishing curation workflows and application of computational biology methods to exploit the knowledge contained in the maps.

Mosquitoes that have been genetically engineered for resistance to human pathogens are a potential new tool for controlling vector-borne disease. However, genetic modification may have unintended off-target effects that could affect the mosquitoes’ utility for disease control. We measured the resistance of five genetically modified &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt;-suppressing &lt;i&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/i&gt; lines to o’nyong’nyong virus, four classes of insecticides, and diverse &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; field isolates and characterized the interactions between our genetic modifications and infection with the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;. The genetic modifications did not alter the mosquitoes’ resistance to either o’nyong’nyong virus or insecticides, and the mosquitoes were equally resistant to all tested &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; strains, regardless of &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; infection status.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype E almost exclusively occurs in African people, and its presence is more commonly associated with the development of chronic HBV (CHB) infection. Moreover, an epidemiological link has been found between the distribution of HBV genotype E infection and African countries with high incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma. As part of a programme for the health assessment of migrants, we evaluated 358 young African subjects for HBV infection; 58.1% (208/358) were positive for an HBV marker, and 54 (25.5%) had CHB. Eighty-one percent of the CHB subjects were infected with HBV genotype E, with a median serum HBV-DNA of 3.2 (IQR: 2.7–3.6) logIU/ml. All patients had high serum HBsAg titres (10,899 [range 5,359–20,272] IU/ml), and no correlation was found between HBsAg titres and HBV-DNA plasma levels. RT sequence analysis showed the presence of a number of immune escape mutations: strains from all of the patients had a serine at HBsAg position 140; 3 also had T116N, Y100C, and P142L+S143L substitutions; and 1 had a G112R substitution. Six (18%) patients had stop-codons at position 216. In 5 of the 9 (26.5%) CHB patients, ultrasound liver biopsy, quantification of total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA, and RT/HBsAg sequencing were performed. The median (IQR) total intrahepatic HBV-DNA was 766 (753–1139) copies/1000 cells, and the median (IQR) cccDNA was 17 (10–27) copies/1000 cells. Correlations were observed for both total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA with serum HBV-DNA, while no correlation was found for the HBsAg titres. A difference of 2.5/1,000 nucleotides was found in the HBsAg sequences obtained from plasma and from liver tissue, with 3 cases of possible viral anatomical compartmentalization. In conclusion, a high rate of CHB infection due to the E genotype was demonstrated in a group of immigrants from Western Africa. An analysis of the viral strains obtained showed the virological characteristics of immune escape, which may be the cause of viral replication persistence. Moreover, a fair percentage of stop codon mutations were found. The lack of correlation between HBsAg titres and plasma or intrahepatic HBV-DNA found in these subjects suggests a pathway of virus production that is not linked to HBsAg secretion. Studies with a larger number of patients with CHB due to the E genotype are advisable to corroborate these observations.</content></content><author><name>Vincenzo Malagnino</name></author><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vincenzo Malagnino, Romina Salpini, Gaetano Maffongelli, Arianna Battisti, Lavinia Fabeni, Lorenzo Piermatteo, Luna Colagrossi, Vanessa Fini, Alessandra Ricciardi, Cesare Sarrecchia, Carlo Federico Perno, Massimo Andreoni, Valentina Svicher, Loredana Sarmati&lt;/p&gt;

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, fatal manifestation of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS). Some patients with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis undergo lung transplantation despite their disease-associated bleeding tendency; others die while awaiting donor organs. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical management and outcomes of a cohort with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis who were evaluated for lung transplantation. Six patients with HPS-1 pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and one of two regional lung transplant centers. Their median age was 41.5 years pre-transplant. Three of six patients died without receiving a lung transplant. One of these was referred with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis and died before a donor organ became available, and donor organs were not identified for two other patients sensitized from prior blood product transfusions. Three of six patients received bilateral lung transplants; they did not have a history of excessive bleeding. One patient received peri-operative desmopressin, one was transfused with intra-operative platelets, and one received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intra-operative prothrombin complex concentrate, platelet transfusion, and desmopressin. One transplant recipient experienced acute rejection that responded to pulsed steroids. No evidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction or recurrence of HPS pulmonary fibrosis was detected up to 6 years post-transplant in these three lung transplant recipients. In conclusion, lung transplantation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are viable options for patients with HPS pulmonary fibrosis. Alloimmunization in HPS patients is an important and potentially preventable barrier to lung transplantation; interventions to limit alloimmunization should be implemented in HPS patients at risk of pulmonary fibrosis to optimize their candidacy for future lung transplants.</content></content><author><name>Souheil El-Chemaly</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Souheil El-Chemaly, Kevin J.

Swarm-founding ‘Warrior wasps’ (&lt;i&gt;Synoeca&lt;/i&gt; spp.) are found throughout the tropical regions of South America, are much feared due to their aggressive nest defence and painful sting. There are only five species of &lt;i&gt;Synoeca&lt;/i&gt;, all construct distinctive nests that consist of a single sessile comb built onto the surface of a tree or rock face, which is covered by a ribbed envelope. Although locally common, research into this group is just starting. We studied eight colonies of &lt;i&gt;Synoeca septentrionalis&lt;/i&gt;, a species recently been described from Brazil. A new colony is established by a swarm of 52 to 140 adults that constructs a colony containing around 200 brood cells. The largest colony collected containing 865 adults and over 1400 cells. The number of queen’s present among the eight colonies varied between 3 and 58 and no clear association between colony development and queen number was detected. Workers and queens were morphologically indistinguishably, but differences in their cuticular hydrocarbons were detected, particularly in their (Z)-9-alkenes. The simple cuticular profile, multiple queens, large size and small number of species makes the ‘Warrior wasps’ an excellent model group for further chemical ecology studies of swarm-founding wasps.</content></content><author><name>Eliaber B.

By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (&lt;i&gt;Delphinium&lt;/i&gt; spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great. Agent-based models (ABMs) provide an effective method of testing alternate management strategies without risk to livestock. ABMs are especially useful for modeling complex systems such as livestock grazing management, and allow for realistic bottom-up encoding of cattle behavior. Here, we introduce a spatially-explicit, behavior-based ABM of cattle grazing in a pasture with a dangerous amount of Geyer’s larkspur (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;geyeri&lt;/i&gt;). This model tests the role of herd cohesion and stocking density in larkspur intake, finds that both are key drivers of larkspur-induced toxicosis, and indicates that alteration of these factors within realistic bounds can mitigate risk. Crucially, the model points to herd cohesion, which has received little attention in the discipline, as playing an important role in lethal acute toxicosis. As the first ABM to model grazing behavior at realistic scales, this study also demonstrates the tremendous potential of ABMs to illuminate grazing management dynamics, including fundamental aspects of livestock behavior amidst ecological heterogeneity.</content></content><author><name>Kevin E.

We applied an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; selection approach using two different plant lectins that bind to α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acids to determine which genetic changes of the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus alter hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding toward α2,3- or α2,6-linked glycans. Consecutive passages of the A/California/04/09 virus with or without lectins in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells led to development of three HA1 amino acid substitutions, N129D, G155E, and S183P, and one mutation in the neuraminidase (NA), G201E. The S183P mutation significantly increased binding to several α2,6 SA-linked glycans, including YDS, 6′SL(N), and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to the wild-type virus (↑3.6-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Two other HA1 mutations, N129D and G155E, were sufficient to significantly increase binding to α2,6-linked glycans, 6′SLN and 6-Su-6′SLN, compared to S183P (↑4.1-fold, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). These HA1 mutations also increased binding affinity for 3′SLN glycan compared to the wild-type virus as measured by Biacore surface plasmon resonance method. In addition, the HA1 N129D and HA1 G155E substitutions were identified as antigenic mutations. Furthermore, the G201E mutation in NA reduced the NA enzyme activity (↓2.3-fold). These findings demonstrate that the A/California/04/09 (H1N1) virus can acquire enhanced receptor affinity for both α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic receptors under lectin-induced selective pressure. Such changes in binding affinity are conferred by selection of beneficial HA1 mutations that affect receptor specificity, antigenicity, and/or functional compatibility with the NA protein.</content></content><author><name>Nicolette Lee</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicolette Lee, Alexey M.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4, and 8 reportedly contribute to progression of metabolic disease, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether circulating ANGPTL levels are associated with CVD risk after adjustment for potential confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a single center, cross-sectional study of 988 Japanese subjects undergoing routine health checks. Serum ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using multiple regression analysis we evaluated potential association of circulating ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels with general medical status including age, sex, smoking, drinking, obesity, hypertension, impaired glycometabolism, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, hepatic impairment, chronic kidney disease, anemia, cardiac abnormality, and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Circulating ANGPTL3 levels were relatively high in health-related categories of hepatic impairment and inflammation. Circulating ANGPTL4 levels were also significantly high in impaired glycometabolism or hepatic impairment but decreased in inflammation. Finally, increased ANGPTL8 levels were observed in obesity, impaired glycometabolism and dyslipidemia. Particularly, increased levels of circulating ANGPTL8 were positively correlated with circulating triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels and inversely correlated with circulating HDL-cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Circulating ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels reflect some risk factors for CVD development.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jun Morinaga</name></author><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jun Morinaga, Jiabin Zhao, Motoyoshi Endo, Tsuyoshi Kadomatsu, Keishi Miyata, Taichi Sugizaki, Yusuke Okadome, Zhe Tian, Haruki Horiguchi, Kazuya Miyashita, Nobuhiro Maruyama, Masashi Mukoyama, Yuichi Oike&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract &lt;p&gt;Meta-research is research about research. Meta-research may not be as click-worthy as a meta-pug—a pug dog dressed up in a pug costume—but it is crucial to understanding research. A particularly valuable contribution of meta-research is to identify biases in a body of evidence. Bias can occur in the design, conduct, or publication of research and is a systematic deviation from the truth in results or inferences. The findings of meta-research can tell us which evidence to trust and what must be done to improve future research. We should be using meta-research to provide the evidence base for implementing systemic changes to improve research, not for discrediting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dx20SHTzNfY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Lisa Bero</name></author><crawled>1522691040056</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lisa Bero&lt;/p&gt;

Twenty-seven young team sports male players performed a 4 sets of 7 repetitions of inertial eccentric overload training, biweekly for 6 weeks, distributed in unilateral lunge group (UG: age: 22.8 ± 2.9 years; body mass: 75.3 ± 8.8 kg; height: 177.3 ± 3.7 cm) and bilateral squat group (BG: age: 22.6 ± 2.7 years; body mass: 79.5 ± 12.8 kg; height: 164.2 ± 7 cm). Lower limb muscle volume, counter movement jump (CMJ), power with both (POWER), dominant (POWERd) and no-dominant leg (POWERnd), change of direction turn of 90° with dominant (COD90d) and no-dominant leg (COD90nd) and 180° (COD180d and COD180nd), and 10m sprint time (T-10m) were measured pre and post-intervention.

The usefulness of a diagnostic workup for occult cancer in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) is controversial. We used the RIETE (Registro Informatizado Enfermedad Trombo Embólica) database to perform a nested case-control study to validate a prognostic score that identifies patients with unprovoked VTE at increased risk for cancer. We dichotomized patients as having low- (≤2 points) or high (≥3 points) risk for cancer, and tried to validate the score at 12 and 24 months. From January 2014 to October 2016, 11,695 VTE patients were recruited. Of these, 1,360 with unprovoked VTE (11.6%) were eligible for the study. At 12 months, 52 patients (3.8%; 95%CI: 2.9–5%) were diagnosed with cancer. Among 905 patients (67%) scoring ≤2 points, 22 (2.4%) had cancer. Among 455 scoring ≥3 points, 30 (6.6%) had cancer (hazard ratio 2.8; 95%CI 1.6–5; p&amp;lt;0.01). C-statistic was 0.63 (95%CI 0.55–0.71). At 24 months, 58 patients (4.3%; 95%CI: 3.3–5.5%) were diagnosed with cancer. Among 905 patients scoring ≤2 points, 26 (2.9%) had cancer.

This may help to identify patients for whom more extensive screening workup may be required.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Application of ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC) for developing a multifunctional tissue preservative solution</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e33a2:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1521061200000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</originId><published>1521061200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4fd8268</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tzong-Ming Shieh, Chi-Yuan Chen, Chuen Hsueh, Cheng-Chia Yu, Chin-Chuan Chen, Tong-Hong Wang&lt;/p&gt;
The quality of biological samples greatly affects the accuracy of scientific results. However, RNA in cryopreserved tissues gradually degrades during storage, leading to errors in the results of subsequent experiments. A suitable sample preservative solution can prolong storage and enhance the research value of samples. Here, we developed a sample preservative solution using the properties of the ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC) and compared its effects on RNA and DNA quality, protein activity, and tissue morphology with the commercially available and widely used RNAlater® Stabilization Solution. The results showed that both the RVC-based preservative solution and RNAlater can effectively delay RNA degradation in tissue samples stored at 4°C or −80°C compared with samples stored without any preservative solution. In contrast to RNAlater, the RVC-based preservative solution did not result in damage to the tissue morphology or a loss of protein activity. Additionally, the RVC-based preservative solution did not affect the RNA and genomic DNA contents of the tissue samples or the results of subsequent experimental analyses. An RVC-based reagent can be used as a multifunctional yet relatively inexpensive tissue preservative solution to provide a comprehensive and cost-effective method for preserving samples for tissue banks.</content></content><author><name>Tzong-Ming Shieh</name></author><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tzong-Ming Shieh, Chi-Yuan Chen, Chuen Hsueh, Cheng-Chia Yu, Chin-Chuan Chen, Tong-Hong Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Ethanol (ET) is a substance that modulates the Central Nervous System (CNS). Frequently, ET intake occurs combined with energy drinks, which contain taurine (TA), an important amino acid found in the body (i.e brain and muscles). Although TA administration has been used in the improvement of physical performance, the impact of TA, ET and exercise remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the acute effect of 6g of Taurine (TA), 0.6 mL∙kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of Ethanol (ET), and Taurine combined with Ethanol (TA+ET) ingestion on the electrocortical activity before and after a moderate intensity exercise in 9 subjects, 5 women (counterbalanced experimental design). In each of the 4 treatments (Placebo—PL, TA, ET and TA+ET), electroencephalography (EEG) tests were conducted in order to analyze changes in absolute beta power (ABP) in the frontal lobe in 3 moments: baseline (before ingestion), peak (before exercise) and post-exercise. In the PL treatment, the frontal areas showed decrease in ABP after exercise. However, in the ET+TA treatment, ABP values were greater after exercise, except for Fp1. The ET treatment had no effect on the Superior Frontal Gyrus area (F3, Fz and F4) and ABP decreased after exercise in Fp1 and Fp2. In the TA treatment, ABP increased after exercise, while it decreased at the peak moment in most of the frontal regions, except for Fp1, F3 and Fz. We concluded that after a moderate intensity exercise, a decrease in cortical activity occurs in placebo treatment. Moreover, we found a inhibitory effect of TA on cortical activity before exercise and a increased in cortical activity after exercise.

Ethanol (ET) is a substance that modulates the Central Nervous System (CNS). Frequently, ET intake occurs combined with energy drinks, which contain taurine (TA), an important amino acid found in the body (i.e brain and muscles). Although TA administration has been used in the improvement of physical performance, the impact of TA, ET and exercise remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the acute effect of 6g of Taurine (TA), 0.6 mL∙kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of Ethanol (ET), and Taurine combined with Ethanol (TA+ET) ingestion on the electrocortical activity before and after a moderate intensity exercise in 9 subjects, 5 women (counterbalanced experimental design). In each of the 4 treatments (Placebo—PL, TA, ET and TA+ET), electroencephalography (EEG) tests were conducted in order to analyze changes in absolute beta power (ABP) in the frontal lobe in 3 moments: baseline (before ingestion), peak (before exercise) and post-exercise. In the PL treatment, the frontal areas showed decrease in ABP after exercise. However, in the ET+TA treatment, ABP values were greater after exercise, except for Fp1. The ET treatment had no effect on the Superior Frontal Gyrus area (F3, Fz and F4) and ABP decreased after exercise in Fp1 and Fp2. In the TA treatment, ABP increased after exercise, while it decreased at the peak moment in most of the frontal regions, except for Fp1, F3 and Fz. We concluded that after a moderate intensity exercise, a decrease in cortical activity occurs in placebo treatment. Moreover, we found a inhibitory effect of TA on cortical activity before exercise and a increased in cortical activity after exercise. A small ET dose is not enough to alter ABP in all regions of the frontal cortex and, in combination with TA, it showed an increase in the frontal cortex activity at the post-exercise moment.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>System Biology Modeling with Compositional Microbiome Data Reveals Personalized Gut Microbial Dynamics and Keystone Species [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288803v1?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162676a2597:622e0db:9f3b30f2</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/288803</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288803v1?rss=1</originId><published>1522134000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><fingerprint>243f895</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288803v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>A growing body of literature points to the important roles that different microbial communities play in diverse natural environments and the human body.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a significant global public health problem and recognized as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to assess the current prevalence of hypertension and to explore risk factors associated with hypertension by urban and rural status to guide the prevention and control of hypertension in Jilin province.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A multi-stage stratified random cluster sampling method was used to obtain data on hypertension, which was investigated by physical examination and face-to-face questionnaire in July 2014-December 2015. Sample data were analyzed by complex weighted statistical analysis to estimate blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension in the province. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing hypertension rates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in rural areas than urban areas (25.93% versus 22.73%, respectively). The rates of hypertension known (46.7% versus 38.1%, respectively), control (13.7% versus 5.0%, respectively), and controlled among treated subjects (38.3% versus 17.5%, respectively) were higher in urban areas than in rural areas (all p &amp;lt; 0.001), while the treatment rate was not statistically significantly different between urban and rural areas (35.9% versus 28.4%, respectively). After adjusting for demographic covariates, hypertension prevalence in rural areas was still significantly greater than in urban areas (adjusted OR = 1.22; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.36; p &amp;lt; 0.001).

Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands. Forests showed less resistance to climate stress and a higher chance of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions. If this scenario occurs, the forest ecosystems would have less chance of adaptation compared to savannas or grasslands because of their narrow climate niche. Therefore, we can conclude that a possible consolidation of non-analogous climatic conditions would lead to a loss of resilience in the forest ecosystem, significantly increasing the chance of a critical transition event to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover (e.g., savanna or grassland).</content></content><author><name>Luciano J.

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. On high-resolution manometry (HRM), impaired LES relaxation is defined by elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP). However, a new category of achalasia within the normal IRP range has been suggested.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;HRM was performed using a Starlet device and an IRP threshold of 26 mmHg. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) was performed for cases of achalasia diagnosed using established methods. During POEM, the histology of the LES was assessed. Follow-up was performed 2 months post-operatively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients with achalasia (18 women, mean age 53 ± 18.6 years) were included. Among them, 27 were placed in the IRP &gt; 26 mmHg subgroup (impaired LES relaxation on HRM) and 14 in the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup (normal LES relaxation on HRM). In the IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup, patients were older, had longer symptom duration, and had more esophageal dilation. The IRP ≤ 26 mmHg subgroup had the same symptom severity as the higher IRP subgroup and POEM significantly improved symptoms and IRP, although four patients still had severe LES fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The clinical presentation of achalasia has a gap between a HRM-defined impaired LES relaxation, with aging or disease progression considered reasons for a lowered LES pressure. POEM can be a feasible treatment option, even for cases of achalasia with a normal IRP.

Background &lt;p&gt;Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most prevalent congenital infection acquired worldwide, with higher incidence in developing countries and among HIV-exposed children. Less is known regarding vertical transmission of parvovirus B19 (B19V) and enterovirus (EV). We aimed to assess the prevalence of CMV, B19V and EV vertical transmission and compare results of screening of congenital CMV obtained from two different specimens in a semirural Mozambican maternity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant mothers attending Manhiça District Hospital upon delivery. Information on maternal risk factors was ascertained. Dried umbilical cord (DUC) samples were collected in filter paper for CMV, B19V and EV detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) to test for CMV by RT-PCR. Maternal blood samples and placental biopsy samples were also obtained to investigate CMV maternal serology, HIV status and immunopathology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From September 2014 to January 2015, 118 mothers/newborn pairs were recruited. Prevalence of maternal HIV infection was 31.4% (37/118). CMV RT-PCR was positive in 3/115 (2.6%) of DUC samples and in 3/96 (6.3%) of NPA samples obtained from neonates. The concordance of the RT-PCR assay through DUC with their correspondent NPA sample was moderate (Kappa = 0.42 and p&amp;lt;0.001. No differences on cCMV prevalence were found among HIV-exposed and unexposed. All (100%) mothers were seropositive for CMV IgG. RT-PCR of EV and B19V in DUC were both negative in all screened cases. No histological specific findings were found in placental tissues. No risk factors associated to vertical transmission of these viral infections were found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study indicates the significant occurrence of vertical transmission of CMV in southern Mozambique. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the true burden, clinical relevance and consequences of congenital infections with such pathogens in resource-constrained settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Lola Madrid</name></author><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lola Madrid, Rosauro Varo, Sonia Maculuve, Tacilta Nhampossa, Carmen Muñoz-Almagro, Enrique J.

&lt;i&gt;Lolium perenne&lt;/i&gt; L. (perennial ryegrass) is the most important pasture grass species in temperate regions of the world. However, its growth is restricted in summer dry environments. Germplasm screening can be used to identify accessions or individual plants for incorporation into breeding programs for drought tolerance. We selected nine perennial ryegrass accessions from different global origins and from a range of climatic and environmental conditions. In addition, the perennial ryegrass cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’ was chosen as a reference. The accessions were grown for 360 days in a controlled environment through six consecutive drought stress and recovery cycles. We observed intraspecific differences in drought stress responsiveness for shoot biomass and survival from the third stress cycle. An accession from Norway had 50% more shoot dry matter than the next best-performing accession after six drought cycles. Compared with the reference cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’, shoot dry matter of the accession from Norway was more than seven times higher after six drought cycles, indicating superior performance of this ecotype under drought stress. Drought tolerance was characterized by osmotic adjustment and higher relative leaf water content at low soil moisture levels. Furthermore, the findings of this study identify solute potential as an early predictor of drought stress tolerance. These intraspecific differences can be used in breeding programs for the development of drought-tolerant perennial ryegrass cultivars.</content></content><author><name>Daliya Cyriac</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daliya Cyriac, Rainer W.

Aranbaltza is an archaeological complex formed by at least three open-air sites. Between 2014 and 2015 a test excavation carried out in Aranbaltza III revealed the presence of a sand and clay sedimentary sequence formed in floodplain environments, within which six sedimentary units have been identified. This sequence was formed between 137–50 ka, and includes several archaeological horizons, attesting to the long-term presence of Neanderthal communities in this area. One of these horizons, corresponding with Unit 4, yielded two wooden tools. One of these tools is a beveled pointed tool that was shaped through a complex operational sequence involving branch shaping, bark peeling, twig removal, shaping, polishing, thermal exposition and chopping. A use-wear analysis of the tool shows it to have traces related with digging soil so it has been interpreted as representing a digging stick. This is the first time such a tool has been identified in a European Late Middle Palaeolithic context; it also represents one of the first well-preserved Middle Palaeolithic wooden tool found in southern Europe. This artefact represents one of the few examples available of wooden tool preservation for the European Palaeolithic, allowing us to further explore the role wooden technologies played in Neanderthal communities.</content></content><author><name>Joseba Rios-Garaizar</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joseba Rios-Garaizar, Oriol López-Bultó, Eneko Iriarte, Carlos Pérez-Garrido, Raquel Piqué, Arantza Aranburu, María José Iriarte-Chiapusso, Illuminada Ortega-Cordellat, Laurence Bourguignon, Diego Garate, Iñaki Libano&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. are a leading cause of bacterial enteritis worldwide, including countries in Africa, and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of the high priority antimicrobial resistant pathogens. However, at present there is little knowledge on the prevalence, molecular epidemiology or antimicrobial susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolates in Botswana, both in patients and in the zoonotic context. Some data indicate that ~14% of diarrhoeal disease cases in a paediatric setting can be ascribed to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp., urging the need for the magnitude of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;-associated diarrhoea to be established. In this survey, we have characterised the genomic diversity of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. circulating in Botswana isolated from cases of diarrhoeal disease in humans (n = 20) and from those that colonised commercial broiler (n = 35) and free-range (n = 35) chickens. Phylogeny showed that the &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from the different poultry and human sources were highly related, suggesting that zoonotic transmission has likely occurred. We found that for &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from humans, broilers and free-range chickens, 52% was positive for &lt;i&gt;tetO&lt;/i&gt;, 47% for &lt;i&gt;gyrA&lt;/i&gt;-T86I, 72% for &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA-61&lt;/sub&gt;, with 27% carrying all three resistance determinants.

These results demonstrate the potential of mutation-based diagnostics to detect gynecologic cancers at a stage when they are more likely to be curable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>BRICHOS domain of Bri2 inhibits islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) fibril formation and toxicity in human beta cells [Cell Biology]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2752.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6f4:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/12/E2752/F5.medium.gif</url><width>440</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>369</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2752</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2752.short?rss=1</originId><published>1521567126000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9864c848</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2752.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) into amyloid fibrils in islets of Langerhans is associated with type 2 diabetes, and formation of toxic IAPP species is believed to contribute to the loss of insulin-producing beta cells.

Background &lt;p&gt;Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20–62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012. Soldiers were clustered into different military occupational specialties: Infantry, Administration, Logistics, Logistics/Camp, Medical and Other. Data were collected through the use of the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol at the end of the international mission.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven percent reported MSCI during deployment, with 28% at the end.The most common locations of MSCI during the mission were lower back, knee, shoulders, upper back, neck and foot, while the knee and lower back prevailed at the end of the mission. Almost half of the soldiers who had MSCI reported affected work ability. The most common duties during the mission were vehicle patrolling, staff duties, guard/security duties, foot patrols and transportation. Soldiers reported that vehicle patrolling, staff duties and transportation were demanding with respect to endurance strength, guard/security duties challenged both maximum and endurance strength while foot patrolling challenged maximum and endurance strength, aerobic and anaerobic endurance and speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MSCI during international deployment are common among Swedish soldiers. The results indicate the need to further develop strategies focusing on matching the soldiers’ capacity to the job requirements, with relevant and fair physical selection-tests during the recruitment process and proactive interventions targeting MSCI before and during deployment, in order to enhance soldiers’ readiness and promote operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Alexandra Halvarsson</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandra Halvarsson, Ingela Hagman, Matthias Tegern, Lisbet Broman, Helena Larsson&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to determine the effect of metabolic syndrome (MS) on the reproductive function in fertile (FM) and male partners of infertile couples (MPIC). We performed a cross-sectional study formatting two study groups: partners of pregnant women (n = 238; mean age 32.0) as FM and male partners of infertile couples (n = 2642; mean age 32.6) as MPIC. A standard semen analysis was performed and clinical, laboratory and lifestyle data were analysed. The adapted NCEP-ATPIII criteria were used to define MS. 12.2% of FM and 17.8% of MPIC had MS. In both groups, men with MS were older, they were centrally obese and had higher triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreased HDL cholesterol values as compared to men without MS. However, glucose concentrations as well as fasting insulin levels were significantly higher only in the MPIC-MS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; group. MS was not associated with semen parameters. Testosterone levels were negatively correlated to MS in both groups. This negative association persisted within the BMI categories between MPIC-MS&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and MPIC-MS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups. LH was negatively correlated to MS but only in MPIC. FSH and oestradiol were not correlated to MS. Smoking and alcohol consumption were higher among men with MS. This study shows that except for testosterone, MS has no independent effect on major fertility parameters in different subgroups of men.</content></content><author><name>Kristel Ehala-Aleksejev</name></author><crawled>1521255609657</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kristel Ehala-Aleksejev, Margus Punab&lt;/p&gt;

Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance. Variant alleles were extremely rare in our population (MAF&amp;lt;0.025) except for R202Q (MAF = 0.27). None was associated with SpA diagnosis (p&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene SNPs are not associated with SpA in the North-East of Italy.

Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance. Variant alleles were extremely rare in our population (MAF&amp;lt;0.025) except for R202Q (MAF = 0.27). None was associated with SpA diagnosis (p&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene SNPs are not associated with SpA in the North-East of Italy. AS risk appears to depend not only on &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt;, but also on the protective &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; haplotype -1031C/-308G. The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10A&gt;G impacts on the response to anti-TNFα therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>The effect of pond dyes on oviposition and survival in wild UK &amp;lt;i&gt;Culex&amp;lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2804:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</originId><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>38533848</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Natali Ortiz-Perea, Rebecca Gander, Oliver Abbey, Amanda Callaghan&lt;/p&gt;
British &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; complex [&lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato) mosquito distribution, abundance, and potential for disease transmission are intimately linked to their environment. Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. &lt;i&gt;Culex (&lt;/i&gt;mostly &lt;i&gt;pipiens)&lt;/i&gt; is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt;. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye.</content></content><author><name>Natali Ortiz-Perea</name></author><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natali Ortiz-Perea, Rebecca Gander, Oliver Abbey, Amanda Callaghan&lt;/p&gt;

Outbreaks of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been reported in poultry species in the United States since 2014. These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2–4 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection.</description><title>Efficacy and synergy of live-attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccines in young chickens</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195285</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd074:7c9981b6</id><updated>1523048400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195285</originId><published>1523048400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>260bbdf1</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195285</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyesun Jang, Mohamed Elaish, Mahesh KC, Michael C.

Penile acquisition of HIV infection contributes substantially to the global epidemic. Our goal was to establish a preclinical macaque model of penile HIV infection for evaluating the efficacy of new HIV prevention modalities. Rhesus macaques were challenged once or twice weekly with consistent doses of SHIV&lt;sub&gt;sf&lt;/sub&gt;162P3 (a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus containing HIV &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt;) ranging from 4–600 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (50% tissue culture infective dose), via two penile routes, until systemic SHIV infection was confirmed. One route exposed the inner foreskin, glans and urethral os to virus following deposition into the prepuce (foreskin) pouch. The second route introduced the virus non-traumatically into the distal urethra only. Single-route challenges resulted in dose-dependent rates of SHIV acquisition informing selection of optimal SHIV dosing. Concurrent SHIV challenges via the prepuce pouch (200 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and urethra (16 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) resulted in infection of 100% (10/10) animals following a median of 2.5 virus exposures (range, 1–12). We describe the first rhesus macaque repeat-exposure SHIV challenge model of penile HIV acquisition. Utilization of the model should further our understanding of penile HIV infection and facilitate the development of new HIV prevention strategies for men.</content></content><author><name>David A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates sharing identical DNA fingerprint patterns can be epidemiologically linked. However, municipal health services in the Netherlands are able to confirm an epidemiological link in only around 23% of the patients with isolates clustered by the conventional variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genotyping. This research aims to investigate whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a more reliable predictor of epidemiological links between tuberculosis patients than VNTR genotyping.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;VNTR genotyping and WGS were performed in parallel on all &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex isolates received at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in 2016. Isolates were clustered by VNTR when they shared identical 24-loci VNTR patterns; isolates were assigned to a WGS cluster when the pair-wise genetic distance was ≤ 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Cluster investigation was performed by municipal health services on all isolates clustered by VNTR in 2016. The proportion of epidemiological links identified among patients clustered by either method was calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 535 isolates were genotyped, of which 25% (134/535) were clustered by VNTR and 14% (76/535) by WGS; the concordance between both typing methods was 86%. The proportion of epidemiological links among WGS clustered cases (57%) was twice as common than among VNTR clustered cases (31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;When WGS was applied, the number of clustered isolates was halved, while all epidemiologically linked cases remained clustered.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;).

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (&lt;i&gt;Anas acuta&lt;/i&gt;), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23209-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Pacemaker Implantation Associated Myocardial Micro-Damage: A Randomised Comparison between Active and Passive Fixation Leads</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23209-5</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16242e7d867:2d2b79e:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23209-5/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23209_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>496</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23209-5</originId><published>1521529200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b391580</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/41C3oCDC0gk/s41598-018-23209-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pacemaker Implantation Associated Myocardial Micro-Damage: A Randomised Comparison between Active and Passive Fixation Leads&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacemaker Implantation Associated Myocardial Micro-Damage: A Randomised Comparison between Active and Passive Fixation Leads, Published online: 20 March 2018;

Both stem cell therapy and physical treatments have been shown to be beneficial in accelerating bone healing. However, the efficacy of combined treatment with stem cells and physical stimuli for large bone defects remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone regeneration effects of low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) and human adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) treatments during fracture repair using a comparative rat calvarial defect model. We evaluated the viability of human ADSCs, which were cultured on a porous PLGA scaffold using an MTS assay. The critical-sized calvarial bone defect rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPLI group, ADSC group, and ADSC+LPLI group. Bone formation was evaluated using micro-CT. New bone formation areas and osteogenic factor expression levels were then examined by histomorphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Our data showed that PLGA had no cytotoxic effect on human ADSCs. Micro-CT analyses revealed that both the LPLI and ADSC groups showed improved calvarial bone defect healing compared to the control group. In addition, the ADSC+LPLI group showed significantly increased bone volume at 16 weeks after surgery. The area of new bone formation ranked as follows: control group &amp;lt; LPLI group &amp;lt; ADSC group &amp;lt; ADSC+LPLI group. There were significant differences between the groups. In addition, both ADSC and ADSC+LPLI groups showed strong signals of vWF expression. ADSC and LPLI treatments improved fracture repair in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats.

Population wellbeing, an aggregate measure of positive mental, physical, and emotional health, has previously been used as a marker of community thriving. We examined whether several community measures of wellbeing, and their change since 2012, could be used to understand electoral changes that led to the outcome of the 2016 United States presidential election. We found that areas of the US which had the largest shifts away from the incumbent party had both lower wellbeing and greater drops in wellbeing when compared with areas that did not shift. In comparison, changes in income were not related to voting shifts. Well-being may be more useful in predicting and understanding electoral outcomes than some more conventional voting determinants.</content></content><author><name>Jeph Herrin</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeph Herrin, Dan Witters, Brita Roy, Carley Riley, Diana Liu, Harlan M.

Feed costs account for over 70% of the annual expenditures in cow/calf production. During the production year the cow uses nutrients to support conceptus growth, milk production, work (grazing and locomotion), and maintenance requirements. The majority of the nutrients are used to support maintenance. Substrate cycling has been identified as one of the major contributors toward energy expenditure associated with maintenance in mature cows. The objective of this study was to determine whether beef cows that differ in the efficiency of weight gain differ in the relative abundance of transcripts for metabolic regulation in adipose tissue. Mature beef cows were subjected to feed restriction followed by ad libitum feed. Adipose tissue from twelve cows with high (n = 6) and low (n = 6) gain based on growth performance during the ad libitum feeding period was evaluated for transcriptome expression differences. A total of 496 genes were differentially expressed and passed Bonferroni correction for the animals with greater gain between restriction and realimentation and 491 genes were differentially expressed among animals with lesser gains between feed restriction and realimentation. Of these two differentially expressed gene lists, 144 genes were common between animals with greater and those with lesser gain. Enriched biological processes included the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, respiratory electron transport chain and fatty acid metabolic processes. Specific to adipose tissue of low gaining animals was glycolysis and to high gain animals was coenzyme, steroid, cellular amino acid, nitrogen compound metabolic processes, and sensory perception. The oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways were commonly associated with the high gain animals between feed restriction and realimentation, as well as with the low gaining animals between the two time points. Unique to the high gaining animals were valine degradation and LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function pathways. In this discovery study, genes involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation pathways appear to be critical to mature cows during times of abundant feed after feed restriction.</content></content><author><name>Hannah Crocker Cunningham</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hannah Crocker Cunningham, Kristi M.

In this discovery study, genes involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation pathways appear to be critical to mature cows during times of abundant feed after feed restriction.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4507</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>61</engagement><title>Combinatorial inhibition of PTPN12-regulated receptors leads to a broadly effective therapeutic strategy in triple-negative breast cancer</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4507</link><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_16262ea192b:5b8e92b:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nm.4507-F1.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>362</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4507</originId><published>1522047600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f180fa8f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/qxd2ln0NROA/nm.4507</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Combinatorial inhibition of PTPN12-regulated receptors leads to a broadly effective therapeutic strategy in triple-negative breast cancer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial inhibition of PTPN12-regulated receptors leads to a broadly effective therapeutic strategy in triple-negative breast cancer, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4507&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm.4507&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Targeting tyrosine kinase receptors that share the feedback inhibitor PTPN12 leads to broad spectrum therapeutic suppression of triple-negative breast cancer.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/qxd2ln0NROA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Amritha Nair</name></author><crawled>1522077931819</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Combinatorial inhibition of PTPN12-regulated receptors leads to a broadly effective therapeutic strategy in triple-negative breast cancer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial inhibition of PTPN12-regulated receptors leads to a broadly effective therapeutic strategy in triple-negative breast cancer, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4507&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm.4507&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Targeting tyrosine kinase receptors that share the feedback inhibitor PTPN12 leads to broad spectrum therapeutic suppression of triple-negative breast cancer.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/qxd2ln0NROA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03801-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Contraction of basal filopodia controls periodic feather branching via Notch and FGF signaling</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03801-z</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162a9bb70ce:13fa33d:9aea0a7d</id><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03801-z</originId><published>1523257200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d9073f46</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/lyhHWjYSVNk/s41467-018-03801-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contraction of basal filopodia controls periodic feather branching via Notch and FGF signaling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contraction of basal filopodia controls periodic feather branching via Notch and FGF signaling, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03801-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03801-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Keratinocytes are organised into a periodic pattern in feather branching, but how this is regulated is unclear.

The goal of this study was to evaluate survival of important viral pathogens of livestock in animal feed ingredients imported daily into the United States under simulated transboundary conditions. Eleven viruses were selected based on global significance and impact to the livestock industry, including Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV), Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), Influenza A Virus of Swine (IAV-S), Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Nipah Virus (NiV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Swine Vesicular Disease Virus (SVDV), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) and Vesicular Exanthema of Swine Virus (VESV). Surrogate viruses with similar genetic and physical properties were used for 6 viruses. Surrogates belonged to the same virus families as target pathogens, and included Senecavirus A (SVA) for FMDV, Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) for CSFV, Bovine Herpesvirus Type 1 (BHV-1) for PRV, Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) for NiV, Porcine Sapelovirus (PSV) for SVDV and Feline Calicivirus (FCV) for VESV. For the remaining target viruses, actual pathogens were used. Virus survival was evaluated using Trans-Pacific or Trans-Atlantic transboundary models involving representative feed ingredients, transport times and environmental conditions, with samples tested by PCR, VI and/or swine bioassay. SVA (representing FMDV), FCV (representing VESV), BHV-1 (representing PRV), PRRSV, PSV (representing SVDV), ASFV and PCV2 maintained infectivity during transport, while BVDV (representing CSFV), VSV, CDV (representing NiV) and IAV-S did not. Notably, more viruses survived in conventional soybean meal, lysine hydrochloride, choline chloride, vitamin D and pork sausage casings. These results support published data on transboundary risk of PEDV in feed, demonstrate survival of certain viruses in specific feed ingredients (“high-risk combinations”) under conditions simulating transport between continents and provide further evidence that contaminated feed ingredients may represent a risk for transport of pathogens at domestic and global levels.</content></content><author><name>Scott A.

The maternal mortality situation is analyzed in México as an indicator that reflects the social development level of the country and was one of the millennial development objectives. The effect of a maternal death in the related social group has multiplier effects, since it involves family dislocation, economic impact and disruption of the orphans&apos; normal social development. Two perspectives that causes of maternal mortality were analyzed, on one hand, their relationship with social determinants and on the other, factors directly related to the health system. Evidence shows that comparing populations based on group of selected variables according to social conditions and health care access, statistically significant differences prevail according to education and marginalization levels, and access to medical care. In addition, the Age-Period-Cohort model raised, shows significant progress in terms of a downward trend in maternal mortality in a generational level. Those women born before 1980 had a greater probability of maternal death in relation to recent generations, which is a reflection of the improvement in social determinants and in the Health System.

Background &lt;p&gt;Vector control remains the sole effective method to prevent dengue virus (DENV) transmission, although a vaccine for dengue has recently become available and testing of its efficacy and coverage is being performed in multiple places. Entomological surveillance is a key factor in alerting authorities to possible outbreaks, but until now natural DENV infection of mosquito populations has been scarcely used as an early warning system to monitor fluctuating prevalence of infected mosquitoes. The purpose of this study was to determine the burden of adult and larval/pupae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt; with DENV in urban areas in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Immature insect forms (larvae and pupae) were collected from April 2011 to March 2012, whereas the collection of adults was conducted along 3 years: May 2011 to April 2014. Total RNAs of the samples were extracted and the nested reverse transcriptase PCR assay for detecting and typing DENV was performed. Of the 1333 immature insects collected during the study period, 1186 (89%) were &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and 147 (11%) &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;.

These insights may facilitate development of clinically useful biomarkers.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Automated high-quality reconstruction of metabolic networks from high-throughput data [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282251v1?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16225ad27aa:4d5dfb:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/14/282251</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282251v1?rss=1</originId><published>1521010800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b2dc8017</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282251v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>While new genomes are sequenced at ever increasing rates, their phenotypic analysis remains a major bottleneck of biomedical research.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the factors associated with gait parameters in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The gait analysis was performed in a large cohort of RA patients, and three basic gait parameters (step length, cadence and gait speed) were calculated. Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. Factors associated with gait parameters were analyzed using multivariable linear regression in the three models with forced entry. Then, we divided those patients with Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) scores ≤ 0.5 into two groups according to their gait speed that were compared to identify the characteristics of patients with a good HAQ score but poor walking ability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 318 female patients were analyzed. Knee extension strength had the strongest positive association with all three gait parameters (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), while methotrexate use was also positively associated with all three gait parameters (step length: P &amp;lt; 0.05, cadence: P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 3, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01). The disease activity score was negatively associated with step length and gait speed (step length, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 3). 26% of patients with good HAQ scores showed slow gait speed. Patients with good HAQ scores and slow gait speed had higher disease activity scores (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and lower knee extension strength (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) than those with good HAQ scores and normal gait speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High knee extension strength, low disease activity and administration of methotrexate were strongly associated with good walking ability in female patients with RA. And, even if patients showed good HAQ scores, about quarter of those patients had poor walking ability, and they showed higher disease activity, lower knee extension strength, compared to the patients with normal gait speed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yugo Morita</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yugo Morita, Hiromu Ito, Mie Torii, Akiko Hanai, Moritoshi Furu, Motomu Hashimoto, Masao Tanaka, Masayuki Azukizawa, Hidenori Arai, Tsuneyo Mimori, Shuichi Matsuda&lt;/p&gt;

The IL-1 cytokine family includes eleven members, among which Il-36α, β and γ, IL-36Ra and IL-38. The IL-36 cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-38 is also expressed in the skin and was previously proposed to act as an IL-36 antagonist. In this study, we thus examined expression and function of Il-38 in a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin inflammation. &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA was detected in the epidermis and in primary mouse keratinocytes, but not in dermal fibroblasts. At the peak of IMQ-induced inflammation, skin &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels were reduced, whereas &lt;i&gt;Il-36ra&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression increased. The severity of IMQ-induced skin inflammation, as assessed by recording ear thickness and histological changes, was similar in Il-38 KO and WT littermate control mice, while, in contrast, Il-36ra-deficient mice displayed more severe skin pathology than their WT littermates. Il-38-deficiency had no impact on IMQ-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators in the skin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, on the basal expression of various cytokines or chemokines by cultured primary keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, or on the response of these cells to Il-36β. Finally, after cessation of topical IMQ application, the resolution of skin inflammation was also not altered in Il-38 KO mice. In conclusion, Il-38-deficiency did not impact the development or resolution of IMQ-induced skin inflammation. Our observations further suggest that endogenous Il-38 does not exert Il-36 inhibitory activity in this model, or in cultured skin cells. A potential anti-inflammatory function of Il-38 in mouse skin thus still remains to be demonstrated.</content></content><author><name>Jennifer Palomo</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Palomo, Sabina Troccaz, Dominique Talabot-Ayer, Emiliana Rodriguez, Gaby Palmer&lt;/p&gt;
The IL-1 cytokine family includes eleven members, among which Il-36α, β and γ, IL-36Ra and IL-38. The IL-36 cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-38 is also expressed in the skin and was previously proposed to act as an IL-36 antagonist. In this study, we thus examined expression and function of Il-38 in a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin inflammation. &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA was detected in the epidermis and in primary mouse keratinocytes, but not in dermal fibroblasts. At the peak of IMQ-induced inflammation, skin &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels were reduced, whereas &lt;i&gt;Il-36ra&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression increased.

The overall survival (OS) of patients with ovarian cancer is poor while epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinico-pathologic characteristics, especially the prognostic factors, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Taiwan. Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p&amp;lt;0.001, p = 0.020, p&amp;lt;0.001, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC. Personalized medicine may be needed for different histological types of EOC because of their different outcomes.</content></content><author><name>Lin-Chau Chang</name></author><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin-Chau Chang, Chih-Fen Huang, Mei-Shu Lai, Li-Jiuan Shen, Fe-Lin Lin Wu, Wen-Fang Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p&amp;lt;0.001, p = 0.020, p&amp;lt;0.001, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC. Personalized medicine may be needed for different histological types of EOC because of their different outcomes.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Tis21&amp;lt;/i&gt;-gene therapy inhibits medulloblastoma growth in a murine allograft model</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194206</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cfa09:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1521061200000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194206</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194206</originId><published>1521061200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>610466c5</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194206</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dario Presutti, Manuela Ceccarelli, Laura Micheli, Giuliana Papoff, Simonetta Santini, Simone Samperna, Cristiana Lalli, Lorena Zentilin, Giovina Ruberti, Felice Tirone&lt;/p&gt;
Medulloblastoma (MB), the tumor of the cerebellum, is the most frequent brain cancer in childhood and a major cause of pediatric mortality. Based on gene profiling, four MB subgroups have been identified, i.e., Wnt or Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) types, and subgroup 3 or 4. The Shh-type MB has been shown to arise from the cerebellar precursors of granule neurons (GCPs), where a hyperactivation of the Shh pathway leads to their neoplastic transformation. We have previously shown that the gene &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PC3&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Btg2&lt;/i&gt;) inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation and migration of GCPs. Moreover, the overexpression or the deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, a model of spontaneous Shh-type MB, highly reduces or increases, respectively, the frequency of MB. Here we tested whether Tis21 can inhibit MB allografts. Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously grafted with MB cells explanted from &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. MB allografts were then injected with adeno-associated viruses either carrying &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;) or empty (AAV-CBA). We observed that the treatment with AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; significantly inhibited the growth of tumor nodules, as judged by their volume, and reduced the number of proliferating tumor cells (labeled with Ki67 or BrdU), relative to AAV-CBA-treated control mice. In parallel, AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; increased significantly tumor cells labeled with early and late neural differentiation markers. Overall the results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;-gene therapy slows down MB tumor growth through inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neural differentiation.

Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective. This study provides the groundwork for future studies concerning NMT-transcript-binding miRNAs, and will potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several important diseases.</content></content><author><name>Ranjit Chauhan</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ranjit Chauhan, David Datzkiw, Shailly Varma Shrivastav, Anuraag Shrivastav&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively.

High-temperature thermal contact resistance (TCR) plays an important role in heat-pipe-cooled thermal protection structures due to the existence of contact interface between the embedded heat pipe and the heat resistive structure, and the reduction mechanism of thermal contact resistance is of special interests in the design of such structures. The present paper proposed a finite element model of the high-temperature thermal contact resistance based on the multi-point contact model with the consideration of temperature-dependent material properties, heat radiation through the cavities at the interface and the effect of thermal interface material (TIM), and the geometry parameters of the finite element model are determined by simple surface roughness test and experimental data fitting. The experimental results of high-temperature thermal contact resistance between superalloy GH600 and C/C composite material are employed to validate the present finite element model. The effect of the crucial parameters on the thermal contact resistance with and without TIM are also investigated with the proposed finite element model.</content></content><author><name>Donghuan Liu</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Donghuan Liu, Jing Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Instability after total knee arthroplasty is a critical problem. The purpose of this study was to clarify the stability of implanted knees during walking by comparing differences in dynamic instability during knee acceleration between individuals with or without previously experienced subjective instability, as measured by self-reported questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We examined 92 knees with medial pivot implants. Mean patient age and follow-up duration were 78.4 years and 32.8 months, respectively. An accelerometer was used to investigate the accelerations along three axes; that is, vertical (VT), mediolateral (ML), and anteroposterior (AP) directions in 3-dimensional (3D) space. The analysis in the stance phase and gait cycle was performed by: (1) root mean square (RMS) values of acceleration and (2) frequency domain analysis using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). A self-reported knee instability score was used for the subjective feeling of instability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 76 knees did not feel unstable (group 0), but 16 knees felt unstable (group 1) in patients during activities of daily living. Regarding the RMS, there were no differences in each direction between the groups. For FFT, the cumulative amplitude in the frequency &amp;lt; 30 Hz also showed no significant differences in all directions between the groups during the stance phase (VT, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.335; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.219; AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.523) or gait cycle (VT, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.077; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.082; AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.499).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Gait analysis based on the acceleration data showed that there were no between-group differences in objective dynamic instability during acceleration of the knee, with or without reports of previously experienced subjective instability, as assessed by the self-reported questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Tatsuya Soeno</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Soeno, Tomoharu Mochizuki, Osamu Tanifuji, Hiroshi Koga, Takayuki Murayama, Hiroki Hijikata, Yuki Takahashi, Naoto Endo&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Loss to care is high among asymptomatic HIV-infected women initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. However, whether pregnancy itself plays a role in the high loss to care rate is uncertain. We compared loss to care over seven years between pregnant and non-pregnant women at enrollment into HIV care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective analysis of all ART-naive women aged 15–45 initiating HIV care at two large clinics in Kinshasa, DRC, from 2007–2013. Pregnancy status was recorded at care enrollment. Patients were classified as having no follow-up if they did not return to care after the initial enrollment visit. Among those with at least one follow-up visit after enrollment, we classified patients as lost to care if more than 365 days had passed since their last clinic visit. We used logistic regression to model the association between pregnancy status and no follow-up, and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the association between pregnancy status and time to loss to care.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2175 women included in the analysis, 1497 (68.8%) were pregnant at enrollment. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were less likely to be over 35 years of age (19.1% vs. 31.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and less likely to be in WHO stage III or IV (9.0% vs. 26.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Among pregnant women, 106 (7.1%) were not seen after enrollment, versus 25 (3.7%) non-pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.24–3.24). Of the 2,044 women with at least one follow-up visit, 46.5% of pregnant women and 46.7% of non-pregnant women were lost to care by 5 years; hazards of loss to care were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant women (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.26).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large cohort of HIV-infected women, patients pregnant at care enrollment were more likely to never return for follow-up. Among those who attended at least one follow-up visit, loss to care was not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnancy itself may not be the main driver of the high attrition observed in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jonathan Ross</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Ross, Andrew Edmonds, Donald R.

Sponge-cyanobacteria associations have attracted research interest from an ecological, evolutionary and biotechnological perspective. Current knowledge is, in its majority, “hidden” in metagenomics research studying the entire microbial communities of sponges, while knowledge on these associations is totally missing for certain geographic areas. In this study, we (a) investigated the occurrence of cyanobacteria in 18 sponge species, several of which are studied for the first time for their cyanobionts, from a previously unexplored eastern Mediterranean ecoregion, the Aegean Sea, (b) isolated sponge-associated cyanobacteria, and characterized them based on a polyphasic (morphological-morphometric and molecular phylogenetic analysis) approach, and (c) conducted a meta-analysis on the global diversity of sponge species hosting cyanobacteria, as well as the diversity of cyanobacterial symbionts. Our research provided new records for nine sponge species, previously unknown for this association, while the isolated cyanobacteria were found to form novel clades within &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/i&gt;, Leptolyngbyaceae, Pseudanabaenaceae, and Schizotrichaceae, whose taxonomic status requires further investigation; this is the first report of a Schizotrichaceae cyanobacterium associated with sponges. The extensive evaluation of the literature along with the new data from the Aegean Sea raised the number of sponge species known for hosting cyanobacteria to 320 and showed that the cyanobacterial diversity reported from sponges is yet underestimated.</content></content><author><name>Despoina Konstantinou</name></author><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Despoina Konstantinou, Vasilis Gerovasileiou, Eleni Voultsiadou, Spyros Gkelis&lt;/p&gt;

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</content></content><author><name>Kuan-Mei Hsiung</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

The large body of work demonstrating hyperthermic impairment of neuromuscular function has utilized maximal isometric contractions, but extrapolating these findings to whole-body exercise and submaximal, dynamic contractions may be problematic. We isolated and compared core and skin temperature influences on an isometric force task versus a position task requiring dynamic maintenance of joint angle. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on the flexor carpi radialis at 60% of baseline maximal voluntary contraction while either pushing against a rigid restraint (force task) or while maintaining a constant wrist angle and supporting an equivalent inertial load (position task). Twenty participants performed each task at 0.5°C rectal temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;) intervals while being passively heated from 37.1±0.3°C to ≥1.5°C T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; and then cooled to 37.8±0.3°C, permitting separate analyses of core versus skin temperature influences. During a 3-s contraction, trend analysis revealed a quadratic trend that peaked during hyperthermia for root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude during the force task. In contrast, RMS amplitude during the position task remained stable with passive heating, then rapidly increased with the initial decrease in skin temperature at the onset of passive cooling (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010). Combined hot core and hot skin elicited shifts toward higher frequencies in the sEMG signal during the force task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), whereas inconsistent changes in the frequency spectra occurred for the position task. Based on the patterns of RMS amplitude in response to thermal stress, we conclude that core temperature was the primary thermal afferent influencing neuromuscular response during a submaximal force task, with minimal input from skin temperature. However, skin temperature was the primary thermal afferent during a position task with minimal core temperature influence. Therefore, temperature has a task-dependent impact on neuromuscular responses.</content></content><author><name>Nico A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Previous research using latent class analysis (LCA) identified classes of people with type 2 diabetes and specific profiles of depression and anxiety. Since LCA-derived anxious depression strongly predicts cardiovascular outcomes and mortality but cannot be applied to individuals, we developed a validated combined depression-anxiety metric, the Diabetes Anxiety Depression Scale (DADS), for potential clinical application in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;1,337 participants with type 2 diabetes from the observational community-based Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II completed the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item version (PHQ-9) to assess symptoms of depression, and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GADS) to assess symptoms of anxiety. A single score was calculated by adding all the PHQ-9 items and the four GADS items used for the LCA. Cut-off scores were calculated with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The optimum cut-off scores in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were 18 points for major anxious depression and 8 points for minor anxious depression. A score of 8–17 was associated with a significantly increased incidence of coronary heart disease, whereas a score 18–39 was associated with an increase in both coronary heart disease and cardiovascular mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The DADS has strong psychometric validity in the identification of mixed depression-anxiety in type 2 diabetes, and may contribute to cardiovascular risk prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Wendy A.

The regulatory role of miRNAs has been explored in ovarian cells, and their effects on gonadal development, apoptosis, ovulation, steroid production and corpus luteum (CL) development have been revealed. In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-29b at different stages of bovine CL development and predicted the target genes of miR-29b. We confirmed that miR-29b reduces the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), affects progesterone (PROG) secretion and regulates the function of the CL. RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b was significantly higher in functional CL phases than in the regressed CL phase. Immunohistochemistry showed that OXTR was expressed in both large and small CL cells and was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of these cells. We analyzed the expression levels of OXTR and found that transfection with a miR-29b mimic decreased OXTR expression, but transfection with the inhibitor had a limited effect on the expression of the OXTR protein. At the same time, the secretion of PROG was significantly increased in the miR-29b mimic-transfected group. We also analyzed the effect of miR-29b on the apoptosis of CL cells. Finally, we found that miR-29b could promote the proliferation of bovine CL cells. In conclusion, we found that miR-29b reduces the expression of OXTR and can promote PROG secretion and the proliferation of CL cells via OXTR.</content></content><author><name>Ming-Qiang Xu</name></author><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ming-Qiang Xu, Hao Jiang, Li-Qun Zhang, Xu-Lei Sun, Dan Luo, Yao Fu, Yan Gao, Bao Yuan, Jia-Bao Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are becoming routinely used for the detection of novel and clinically actionable DNA variants at a pangenomic scale. Such analyses are now used in the clinical practice to enable precision medicine. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are still one of the most abundant source of cancer clinical specimen, unfortunately this method of preparation is known to degrade DNA and therefore compromise subsequent analysis. Some studies have reported that variant detection can be performed on FFPE samples sequenced with NGS techniques, but few or none have done an in-depth coverage analysis and compared the influence of different state-of-the-art FFPE DNA extraction kits on the quality of the variant calling. Here, we generated 42 human whole-exome sequencing data sets from fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE samples. These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). We determined the rate of concordance of called variants between matched FF and FFPE samples on all common variants (representing at least 86% of the total number of variants for SNVs). The concordance rate is very high between all matched FF / FFPE pairs, with equivalent values for the three kits we analyzed. On the other hand, when looking at the difference between the total number of variants in FF and FFPE, we find a significant variation for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but statistically significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.</content></content><author><name>Eric Bonnet</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Bonnet, Marie-Laure Moutet, Céline Baulard, Delphine Bacq-Daian, Florian Sandron, Lilia Mesrob, Bertrand Fin, Marc Delépine, Marie-Ange Palomares, Claire Jubin, Hélène Blanché, Vincent Meyer, Anne Boland, Robert Olaso, Jean-François Deleuze&lt;/p&gt;

The present study attempted to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic effect by LPSp in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. For 16 weeks, apoE-deficient mice were fed an HFD and received drinking water containing LPSp (0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight/day). The results showed that the orally administered LPSp decreased body weight. A significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque deposition was observed even with the lower dose of LPSp. The biochemical analyses showed that LPSp markedly improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma LDL and oxidized LDL levels. In addition, LPSp significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators including MCP-1 (in the plasma), TNF-α and IL-6 (in the colon), and decreased the oxidative burst activities in the peripheral blood sample. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that oral administration of LPSp can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative responses to prevent atherosclerosis and related metabolic disorders.</content></content><author><name>Yutaro Kobayashi</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;

Patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) can have extrahepatic manifestations. However, data about cardiac involvement of PBC is limited. We aimed in this study to analyze the clinical characteristics in patients with PBC complicated with and without cardiac involvement, and the risk factors of cardiac involvement in PBC. PBC patients admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2002 and February 2016 were consecutively enrolled. Structured interview, systemic rheumatologic examination, and laboratory tests were conducted for each patient, and risk factors of cardiac involvement were analyzed by comparing patients with and without cardiac involvement. In total, 580 PBC patients were enrolled, and cardiac involvement was identified in 24 patients (4%), with 11 male (46%) and a mean age of 57±8 year. Cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias were presented in 17 (70.8%) and 21 (87.5%) patients, respectively. Patients with cardiac involvement were more frequently male (46% vs. 11%, P&amp;lt;0.01), complicated with inflammatory myopathy (IM) (58% vs. 1%, P&amp;lt;0.01), and had a longer disease course (median, 72 vs 24 month, P&amp;lt;0.01). Furthermore, concomitant IM was the independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC (OR = 77.333, 95% CI: 23.704–252.294). Cardiac involvement was a rare complication of PBC, which was more frequently observed in male or long-course patients. Importantly, concomitant IM was the strong independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC. Given cardiac involvement is a serious complication, thorough evaluation of cardiac manifestation in high-risk PBC patients is highly recommended.</content></content><author><name>Sainan Bian</name></author><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sainan Bian, Hua Chen, Li Wang, Yunyun Fei, Yunjiao Yang, Linyi Peng, Yongzhe Li, Fengchun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Structured interview, systemic rheumatologic examination, and laboratory tests were conducted for each patient, and risk factors of cardiac involvement were analyzed by comparing patients with and without cardiac involvement. In total, 580 PBC patients were enrolled, and cardiac involvement was identified in 24 patients (4%), with 11 male (46%) and a mean age of 57±8 year. Cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias were presented in 17 (70.8%) and 21 (87.5%) patients, respectively. Patients with cardiac involvement were more frequently male (46% vs. 11%, P&amp;lt;0.01), complicated with inflammatory myopathy (IM) (58% vs. 1%, P&amp;lt;0.01), and had a longer disease course (median, 72 vs 24 month, P&amp;lt;0.01). Furthermore, concomitant IM was the independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC (OR = 77.333, 95% CI: 23.704–252.294). Cardiac involvement was a rare complication of PBC, which was more frequently observed in male or long-course patients. Importantly, concomitant IM was the strong independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC. Given cardiac involvement is a serious complication, thorough evaluation of cardiac manifestation in high-risk PBC patients is highly recommended.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Metabolomic and inflammatory mediator based biomarker profiling as a potential novel method to aid pediatric appendicitis identification</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193563</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1621b4b57ed:64b3a6d:7c9981b6</id><updated>1520888400000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193563</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193563</originId><published>1520888400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b4a9748e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193563</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nusrat S.

Various limitations hinder the timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis in pediatric patients. The present study aims to investigate the potential of metabolomics and cytokine profiling for improving the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis. Serum and plasma samples were collected from pediatric patients for metabolic and inflammatory mediator analyses respectively. Targeted metabolic profiling was performed using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Flow Injection Analysis Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry and targeted cytokine/chemokine profiling was completed using a multiplex platform to compare children with and without appendicitis. Twenty-three children with appendicitis and 35 control children without appendicitis from the Alberta Sepsis Network pediatric cohorts were included. Metabolomic profiling revealed clear separation between the two groups with very good sensitivity (80%), specificity (97%), and AUROC (0.93 ± 0.05) values. Inflammatory mediator analysis also distinguished the two groups with high sensitivity (82%), specificity (100%), and AUROC (0.97 ± 0.02) values. A biopattern comprised of 9 metabolites and 7 inflammatory compounds was detected to be significant for the separation between appendicitis and control groups. Integration of these 16 significant compounds resulted in a combined metabolic and cytokine profile that also demonstrated strong separation between the two groups with 81% sensitivity, 100% specificity and AUROC value of 0.96 ± 0.03. The study demonstrated that metabolomics and cytokine mediator profiling is capable of distinguishing children with appendicitis from those without. These results suggest a potential new approach for improving the identification of appendicitis in children.</content></content><author><name>Nusrat S.

Background &lt;p&gt;The HIV care cascade has improved in Latin America over the last decade. However, the influence of alcohol and noninjected drug use (NIDU) on cascade outcomes is mostly unknown. This study estimated the association of alcohol and NIDU with retention in care, loss to follow up (LTFU), and virologic failure (VF).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Individuals ≥18 years attending routine HIV clinic visits and completing the Rapid Screening Tool (RST; evaluating NIDU and ART adherence in 7-day recall period) during 2012–13 were followed up to 2015 in the Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated for the association of alcohol consumption and NIDU with retention in care by logistic regression; adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for the associations with LTFU and VF by Cox regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 3604 individuals, the proportions retained in care for one year were 84%, 79%, 72%, and 69% for patients reporting non-use, alcohol use, NIDU, and both alcohol and NIDU, respectively. For the same patient groups, the proportions LTFU over 18 months were 6%, 8%, 12%, and 13%, respectively. There were 1901 patients (53%) with HIV RNA results; VF proportions were similar between users and nonusers (ranging from 14–16%). After controlling for age, sex, study site, HIV transmission mode, time on ART, AIDS status, and CD4 count, neither alcohol use (aOR = 1.1, CI = 0.9–1.4; aHR = 1.0, CI = 0.8–1.3) nor NIDU (aOR = 1.3, CI = 0.9–1.8; aHR = 1.4, CI = 0.9–2.1) were significantly associated with retention or VF, respectively. However, both alcohol use (aHR = 1.2, CI = 1.02–1.4) and NIDU (aHR = 1.3, CI = 1.00–1.8) were associated with increased LTFU.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Alcohol use and NIDU in a 7-day recall period increased the risk of being LTFU during the next 18 months, highlighting the need for routine screening and targeted interventions to keep these individuals in care and on ART.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Raquel B.

Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated for the association of alcohol consumption and NIDU with retention in care by logistic regression; adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for the associations with LTFU and VF by Cox regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 3604 individuals, the proportions retained in care for one year were 84%, 79%, 72%, and 69% for patients reporting non-use, alcohol use, NIDU, and both alcohol and NIDU, respectively. For the same patient groups, the proportions LTFU over 18 months were 6%, 8%, 12%, and 13%, respectively. There were 1901 patients (53%) with HIV RNA results; VF proportions were similar between users and nonusers (ranging from 14–16%). After controlling for age, sex, study site, HIV transmission mode, time on ART, AIDS status, and CD4 count, neither alcohol use (aOR = 1.1, CI = 0.9–1.4; aHR = 1.0, CI = 0.8–1.3) nor NIDU (aOR = 1.3, CI = 0.9–1.8; aHR = 1.4, CI = 0.9–2.1) were significantly associated with retention or VF, respectively. However, both alcohol use (aHR = 1.2, CI = 1.02–1.4) and NIDU (aHR = 1.3, CI = 1.00–1.8) were associated with increased LTFU.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Alcohol use and NIDU in a 7-day recall period increased the risk of being LTFU during the next 18 months, highlighting the need for routine screening and targeted interventions to keep these individuals in care and on ART.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Proteomic fingerprinting in HIV/HCV co-infection reveals serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of fibrosis staging</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195148</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76922:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1522702800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195148</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195148</originId><published>1522702800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>441554e2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195148</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Makan Golizeh, Carlos E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co- and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. Sera were fractionated, randomly applied to protein chip arrays (IMAC, CM10 and H50) and spectra were generated at low and high laser intensities.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Sixteen biomarkers achieved a p value &amp;lt; 0.01 (ROC values &gt; 0.75 or &amp;lt; 0.25) predictive of fibrosis status in co-infected individuals and 14 in mono infected subjects. Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono- and co-infected subjects. Candidate diagnostic algorithms were created to distinguish between non-fibrotic and fibrotic individuals using a panel of 4 biomarker peaks.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These data suggest that SELDI MS profiling can identify diagnostic serum biomarkers for fibrosis that are both common and distinct in HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Makan Golizeh</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Makan Golizeh, Carlos E.

Background &lt;p&gt;People who use a cochlear implant together with a contralateral hearing aid—so-called bimodal listeners—have poor localisation abilities and sounds are often not balanced in loudness across ears. In order to address the latter, a loudness balancing algorithm was created, which equalises the loudness growth functions for the two ears. The algorithm uses loudness models in order to continuously adjust the two signals to loudness targets. Previous tests demonstrated improved binaural balance, improved localisation, and better speech intelligibility in quiet for soft phonemes. In those studies, however, all stimuli were preprocessed so spontaneous head movements and individual head-related transfer functions were not taken into account. Furthermore, the hearing aid processing was linear.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;In the present study, we simplified the acoustical loudness model and implemented the algorithm in a real-time system. We tested bimodal listeners on speech perception and on sound localisation, both in normal loudness growth configuration and in a configuration with a modified loudness growth function. We also used linear and compressive hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The comparison between the original acoustical loudness model and the new simplified model showed loudness differences below 3% for almost all tested speech-like stimuli and levels. We found no effect of balancing the loudness growth across ears for speech perception ability in quiet and in noise. We found some small improvements in localisation performance. Further investigation with a larger sample size is required.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Dimitar Spirrov</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dimitar Spirrov, Maaike Van Eeckhoutte, Lieselot Van Deun, Tom Francart&lt;/p&gt;

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings. However, tactile suppression was comparable between conditions arguing against the hypothesis that it frees capacities for processing other relevant visual signals.</content></content><author><name>Hanna Gertz</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;African Americans are disproportionately affected by both HIV and hypertension. Failure to modify risk factors for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease such as hypertension among HIV-infected patients may attenuate the benefits conferred by combination antiretroviral therapy. In the general population, African Americans with hypertension are less likely to have controlled blood pressure than whites. However, racial differences in blood pressure control among HIV-infected patients are not well studied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study evaluating racial differences in hypertension prevalence, treatment, and control among 1,664 patients attending the University of Alabama at Birmingham HIV Clinic in 2013. Multivariable analyses were performed to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measure of association between race and hypertension prevalence and control while adjusting for other covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean age of patients was 47 years, 77% were male and 54% African-American. The prevalence of hypertension was higher among African Americans compared with whites (49% vs. 43%; p = 0.02). Among those with hypertension, 91% of African Americans and 93% of whites were treated (p = 0.43). Among those treated, 50% of African Americans versus 60% of whites had controlled blood pressure (systolic blood pressure &amp;lt;140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &amp;lt;90 mmHg) (p = 0.007). After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, prevalence of hypertension was higher among African Americans compared to whites (PR 1.25; 95% CI 1.12–1.39) and prevalence of BP control was lower (PR 0.80; 95% CI 0.69–0.93).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Despite comparable levels of hypertension treatment, African Americans in our HIV cohort were less likely to achieve blood pressure control.

Our understanding on the importance of viral lysis in the functioning of tropical estuarine ecosystem is limited. This study examines viral infection of prokaryotes and subsequent lysis of cells belonging to different morphotypes across a salinity gradient in monsoon driven estuarine ecosystem (Cochin estuary, India). High standing stock of viruses and prokaryotes accompanied by lytic infection rates in the euryhaline/mesohaline region of the estuary suggests salinity to have an influential role in driving interactions between prokaryotes and viruses. High prokaryotic mortality rates, up to 42% of prokaryote population in the pre-monsoon season is further substantiated by a high virus to prokaryote ratio (VPR), suggesting that maintenance of a high number of viruses is dependent on the most active fraction of bacterioplankton. Although myoviruses were the dominant viral morphotype (mean = 43%) throughout the study period, there was significant variation among prokaryotic morphotypes susceptible to viral infection. Among them, the viral infected short rod prokaryote morphotype with lower burst estimates (mean = 18 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was dominant (35%) in the dry seasons whereas a substantial increase in cocci forms (30%) infected by viruses with high burst size (mean = 31 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident during the monsoon season. Such preferential infections of prokaryotic morphopopulations with respect to seasons can have a strong and variable impact on the carbon and energy flow in this tropical ecosystem.</content></content><author><name>Vijayan Jasna</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vijayan Jasna, Angia Sriram Pradeep Ram, Ammini Parvathi, Telesphore Sime-Ngando&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ) poisoning can cause multiple organ failure, in which the lung is the primary target organ. There is currently no treatment for PQ poisoning. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which differentiate into multiple cell types, have generated much enthusiasm regarding their use for the treatment of several diseases. The aim of this study was to systematically review and analyze published preclinical studies describing MSC administration for the treatment of PQ poisoning in animal models to provide a basis for cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The electronic databases PubMed and CBMdisc were searched in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The MSC treatment characteristics of animal models of PQ poisoning were summarized. After quality assessment was performed, the effects of MSC transplantation were evaluated based on the survival rate, lung wet/dry weight, fibrosis scores, oxidative stress response, and inflammatory response. Publication bias was assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eleven controlled preclinical studies involving MSC transplantation in animal models of PQ poisoning were included in this review. MSC therapy improved the survival rate and reduced the lung wet/dry weight and histopathological fibrosis changes in most studies. MSCs decreased serum or plasma malondialdehyde levels in the acute phase after 7 and 14 d and increased serum or plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels at the same time points. IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels in blood or lung tissues were decreased to different degrees by MSCs. Lung hydroxyproline was decreased by MSCs after 14 d. No obvious evidence of publication bias was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;MSCs showed anti-fibrosis therapeutic effects in animal models of lung injury caused by PQ poisoning, which may be related to reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine levels. Our review indicates a potential therapeutic role for MSC therapy to treat PQ poisoning and serves to augment the rationale for clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Fang He</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fang He, Aiting Zhou, Shou Feng, Yuxiang Li, Tao Liu&lt;/p&gt;

In yeast, this proteaphagy occurs upon nitrogen starvation but not carbon starvation, which instead stimulates the rapid sequestration of proteasomes into cytoplasmic puncta termed proteasome storage granules (PSGs). Here, we show that PSGs help protect proteasomes from autophagic degradation.

In yeast, this proteaphagy occurs upon nitrogen starvation but not carbon starvation, which instead stimulates the rapid sequestration of proteasomes into cytoplasmic puncta termed proteasome storage granules (PSGs). Here, we show that PSGs help protect proteasomes from autophagic degradation.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the retention and discontinuation reasons of seven biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in a real-world setting of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 1,037 treatment courses with bDMARDs from 2009 to 2016 [female, 81.8%; baseline age, 59.6 y; disease duration 7.8 y; rheumatoid factor positivity 81.5%; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), 4.4; concomitant prednisolone 43.5% and methotrexate 68.6%; Bio-naïve, 57.1%; abatacept (ABT), 21.3%; tocilizumab (TCZ), 20.7%; golimumab (GLM), 16.9%; etanercept (ETN), 13.6%; adalimumab (ADA), 11.1%; infliximab (IFX), 8.5%; certolizumab pegol (CZP), 7.9%] were included in this multi-center, retrospective study. Drug retention and discontinuation reasons at 36 months were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and adjusted by potent confounders using Cox proportional hazards modeling. As a result, 455 treatment courses (43.9%) were stopped, with 217 (20.9%) stopping due to inefficacy, 113 (10.9%) due to non-toxic reasons, 86 (8.3%) due to toxic adverse events, and 39 (3.8%) due to remission.

Background &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Japanese encephalitis virus&lt;/i&gt; (JEV) is a major cause of encephalitis in Asia, and the commonest cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis worldwide. Detection of JEV RNA remains challenging due to the characteristic brief and low viraemia, with 0–25% of patients positive, and the mainstay of diagnosis remains detection of anti-JEV IgM antibody.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review of published RT-PCR protocols, and evaluated them &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; alongside new primers and probes designed using a multiple genome alignment of all JEV strains &gt;9,000nt from GenBank, downloaded from the NCBI website (November 2016). The new assays included pan-genotype and genotype specific assays targeting genotypes 1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten RT-qPCR assays were compared, a pre-existing in-house assay, three published assays and six newly designed assays, using serial RNA dilutions. We selected three assays, one published and two novel assays, with the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for further optimisation and validation. One of the novel assays, detecting NS2A, showed the best results, with LOD approximately 4 copies/ reaction, and no cross-reaction on testing closely related viruses in the JEV serocomplex, &lt;i&gt;West Nile Virus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;St&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Louis Virus&lt;/i&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;Measuring viral DNA methylation in human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women showed promise for accurate detection of high-grade cervical lesions and cancer.

Modulating immune responses to sepsis and trauma remain one of the most difficult challenges in modern medicine. Large burn injuries (LBI) are a severe form of trauma associated with sepsis, immune impairment, and mortality. Immune dysfunction after LBI is complex, involving both enhanced and impaired immune activation. The release of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, and cytokines (e.g. IL-1β) creates an environment of immune dysfunction often leading to end organ failure and death. Both HMGB1 and IL-1β have been found to play critical roles in sepsis and post-burn immune dysfunction. HMGB1 and IL-1β have been shown previously to form potent complexes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We recently identified the presence of HMGB1/IL-1β heterocomplexes in human tissue. We now find HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in human and mouse plasma, and identify a synergistic role of HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in post-burn immune dysfunction. In both humans and mice, we found that HMGB1 was enriched in plasma microvesicles (MVs) after LBI. HMGB1 was found form complexes with IL-1β. Using flow cytometry of mouse plasma MVs, we identified an increase in an HMGB1+/IL-1β+ MVs. Using co-IP, HMGB1 was found to bind the pro-form of IL-1β in mouse and human plasma. Pro-IL-1β, which is traditionally considered inactive, became active when complexed with HMGB1. Human THP-1 monocytes treated with HMGB1-pro-IL-1β complexes showed increased transcription of LBI associated cytokines IL-6 and IFNβ along with suppression of iNOS, mimicking findings associated with LBI. These findings identify that HMGB1/IL-1β complexes released after burn injuries can modulate immune responses, and microvesicles are identified as a novel reservoir for these immune mediators. These complexes might serve as novel immune targets for the treatment of systemic immune responses due to LBI or other causes of sepsis.</content></content><author><name>Leon G.

Individuals with disabilities are regarded as a highly vulnerable population group, particularly as far as oral health is concern. However, few studies have assessed the impact of the oral condition on the quality of life of these individuals. Therefore, the aim of this study is to expand knowledge on the oral health status of the Portuguese adults with mild intellectual disability, and to assess how the patient’s oral health is related to their quality of life. A sample of 240 adults with mild intellectual disabilities linked to the Portuguese Federation for Intellectual Disability, were interviewed using a previously validated version of the Oral Health Impact Profile. An oral health examination was also conducted using three oral health indexes: Clinical Oral Health Index (COHI); Clinical Oral Care Needs Index (COCNI) and the Clinical Oral Prevention Index (COPI). Sociodemographic characteristics and dental health factors were also collected, following statistical analysis. More than half of the individuals (54,9%) presented one or more problems of major to severe impact on health (COHI level 2); only 4,6% of the individuals do not need treatment or examination (COCNI level 0) and 85% of the study sample needs measures of educational or preventive action (COPI level 1). In 76,9% of the participants, oral health had impact on the quality of life. The most affected dimensions of life were physical pain with 61,9%, followed by psychological discomfort and psychological disability with 45,1% and 45%, respectively. With relation to oral health factors and sociodemographic variables it was verified that fewer teeth and higher self-perception of need for dental treatment had a negative impact on the quality of life. On the other hand, institutionalization and an increase in at least one category in the self-perception of the oral health status had a positive impact on the quality of life. Given the high burden of oral disease and the considerable impact on quality of life found in this study, the establishment of guidelines to improve the oral health and quality of life of these individuals should be regarded as imperative.</content></content><author><name>Patrícia Couto</name></author><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Patrícia Couto, Paulo Almeida Pereira, Manuel Nunes, Rui Amaral Mendes&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, institutionalization and an increase in at least one category in the self-perception of the oral health status had a positive impact on the quality of life. Given the high burden of oral disease and the considerable impact on quality of life found in this study, the establishment of guidelines to improve the oral health and quality of life of these individuals should be regarded as imperative.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Flip-flop method: A new T1-weighted flow-MRI for plants studies</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194845</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef04:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1522357200000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194845</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194845</originId><published>1522357200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1a9229ed</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194845</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Simon Buy, Simon Le Floch, Ning Tang, Rahima Sidiboulenouar, Michel Zanca, Patrick Canadas, Eric Nativel, Maida Cardoso, Eric Alibert, Guillaume Dupont, Dominique Ambard, Christophe Maurel, Jean-Luc Verdeil, Nadia Bertin, Christophe Goze-Bac, Christophe Coillot&lt;/p&gt;

Grass pollen is the main cause of hay fever and allergic asthma in warm temperate climates during summer. The aim of this study was to determine the content of group 5 major allergens in pollen grains of agriculturally important grass species/cultivars. For each cultivar flowering dates and pollen production of cut anthers were observed in the field and in a climate chamber, respectively. An ELISA was used to quantify the group 5 allergens (Phl p5) in pollen extracts which were gained from the grass species Kentucky bluegrass, perennial rye grass, timothy, cocksfoot, annual / Italian rye grass, hybrid rye grass and festulolium. The group 5 allergen content of species varied between 0.01 ng (Kentucky bluegrass) and 0.06 ng (timothy) per pollen grain. On cultivar level the pollen allergenic content differed up to 74-times within the selected grass species. Results from this study might be helpful for the reduction of allergen exposure coming from agriculture grass production e.g. by an adapted grass selection or by the cultivation of grasses with low allergenic content in plant breeding.</content></content><author><name>Stephan Jung</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephan Jung, Nicole Estrella, Michael W.

Background &lt;p&gt;PPAR-gamma (γ) is highly expressed in macrophages and its activation affects their polarization. The effect of PPAR-γ activation on Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) has not yet been evaluated. We investigated the effect of PPAR-γ activation on KC-polarization and IRI.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy percent (70%) liver ischemia was induced for 60mins. PPAR-γ-agonist or vehicle was administrated before reperfusion. PPAR-γ-antagonist was used to block PPAR-γ activation. Liver injury, necrosis, and apoptosis were assessed post-reperfusion. Flow-cytometry determined KC-phenotypes (pro-inflammatory Nitric Oxide +, anti-inflammatory CD206+ and anti-inflammatory IL-10+).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liver injury assessed by serum AST was significantly decreased in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group at all time points post reperfusion (1hr: 3092±105 vs 4469±551; p = 0.042; 6hr: 7041±1160 vs 12193±1143; p = 0.015; 12hr: 5746±328 vs 8608±1259; p = 0.049). Furthermore, liver apoptosis measured by TUNEL-staining was significantly reduced in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group post reperfusion (1hr:2.46±0.49 vs 6.90±0.85%;p = 0.001; 6hr:26.40±2.93 vs 50.13±8.29%; p = 0.048). H&amp;amp;E staining demonstrated less necrosis in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (24hr:26.66±4.78 vs 45.62±4.57%; p = 0.032). The percentage of pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs was significantly lower at all post reperfusion time points in the PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (1hr:28.49±4.99 vs 53.54±9.15%; p = 0.040; 6hr:5.51±0.54 vs 31.12±9.58%; p = 0.009; 24hr:4.15±1.50 vs 17.10±4.77%; p = 0.043). In contrast, percentage of anti-inflammatory CD206+ KCs was significantly higher in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group prior to IRI (8.62±0.96 vs 4.88 ±0.50%; p = 0.04). Administration of PPAR-γ-antagonist reversed the beneficial effects on AST, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;PPAR-γ activation reduces IRI and decreases the pro-inflammatory NO+ Kupffer cells.

Therefore, identifying the distribution of populations throughout their annual cycle (i.e., migratory connectivity) can reveal the complex ecological and evolutionary relationships that...</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22633-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>36</engagement><title>Plasmon induced modification of silicon nanocrystals photoluminescence in presence of gold nanostripes</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22633-x</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16242e7d867:2d2b7a2:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-22633-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_22633_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>205</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22633-x</originId><published>1521529200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>dc20b46c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/dNF2CVSOwkA/s41598-018-22633-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plasmon induced modification of silicon nanocrystals photoluminescence in presence of gold nanostripes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasmon induced modification of silicon nanocrystals photoluminescence in presence of gold nanostripes, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22633-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22633-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Plasmon induced modification of silicon nanocrystals photoluminescence in presence of gold nanostripes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dNF2CVSOwkA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>S.

Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the effects of dopaminergic interventions on pain remains questionable. This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed at exploring the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain evoked by cold stimulation and on spontaneous pain in patients with lumbar radicular (neuropathic) pain.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data was collected from 35 patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (18 men, mean age 56.2±13 years). The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In addition, apomorphine prolonged cold pain tolerance but not threshold in the painful site (from a median of 43.0 seconds (IQR = 63.0) at baseline to 51.0 seconds (IQR = 78.0) at 120 min, p = 0.02). Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>May Haddad</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by May Haddad, Dorit Pud, Roi Treister, Erica Suzan, Elon Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00199</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Determination of the Subcellular Localization and Mechanism of Action of Ferrostatins in Suppressing Ferroptosis</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00199</link><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_16221cfd0cd:17ba095:bdf8aaf1</id><recrawled>1521570626675</recrawled><unread>False</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00199</originId><crawled>1520985690317</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00199/20180313/images/medium/cb-2018-00199g_0004.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>467</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><fingerprint>601be0d1</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00199/20180313/images/medium/cb-2018-00199g_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00199&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Endothelial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of many rheumatic diseases, typified by vascular inflammation and damage. Immunosuppressive drugs induce disease remission and lead to improved patient survival. However, there remains a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease in these patients even after adequate disease control.

We also studied potential mechanisms involved in the observed effects.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Treatment with MPA decreased endothelial colony forming cell proliferation, clonogenic potential and vasculogenic function in a dose-dependent fashion. MPA increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase expression, p21 gene expression and p53 phosphorylation, indicative of activation of cellular senescence. Exogenous guanosine supplementation rescued diminished endothelial colony forming cell proliferation and indices of senescence, consistent with the known mechanism of action of MPA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings show that clinically relevant doses of MPA have potent anti-angiogenic and pro-senescent effects on vascular precursor cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, thus indicating that treatment with MPA can potentially affect vascular repair and regeneration.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Demographic change has led to an increase of older people in need of long-term care in nearly all European countries. Informal carers primarily provide the care and support needed by dependent people. The supply and willingness of individuals to act as carers are critical to sustain informal care resources as part of the home health care provision. This paper describes a longitudinal study of informal care in six European countries and reports analyses that determine those factors predicting the outcomes of family care over a one-year period.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Analyses are based on data from the EUROFAMCARE project, a longitudinal survey study of family carers of older people with baseline data collection in 2004 and follow-up data collection a year later in six European countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), N = 3,348. Descriptive statistics of the sample characteristics are reported. Binary logistic random-intercept regressions were computed, predicting the outcome of change of the care dyad’s status at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Where care is provided by a more distant family member or by a friend or neighbour, the care-recipient is significantly more likely to be cared for by someone else (OR 1.62) or to be in residential care (OR 3.37) after one year. The same holds true if the care-recipient has memory problems with a dementia diagnosis (OR 1.79/OR 1.84). Higher dependency (OR 1.22) and behavioural problems (OR 1.76) in the care-recipient also lead to a change of care dyad status. Country of residence explained a relatively small amount of variance (8%) in whether a care-recipient was cared for by someone else after one year, but explained a substantial amount of variance (52%) in whether a care-recipient was in residential care. Particularly in Sweden, care-recipients are much more likely to be cared for by another family or professional carer or to be in residential care, whereas in Greece the status of the care dyad is much less likely to change.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The majority of family carers continued to provide care to their respective older relatives over a one-year period, despite often high levels of functional, cognitive and behavioural problems in the care-recipient.

The carer/care-recipient relationship plays an important role in whether or not a family care dyad remains intact over a one-year period. The support of health and social care services should be particularly targeted toward those care dyads where there is no partner or spouse acting as carer, or no extended family network that might absorb the caring role when required.

Bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality with rates varying from 10–25% and higher. Appropriate and timely onset of antibiotic therapy influences the prognosis of these patients. It requires the diagnostic accuracy which is not afforded by current gold standards such as blood culture. Moreover, the time from blood sampling to blood culture results is a key determinant of reducing mortality. No established biomarkers exist which can differentiate bloodstream infections from other systemic inflammatory conditions. This calls for studies on biomarkers potential of molecular profiling of plasma as it is affected most by the molecular changes accompanying bloodstream infections. N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification which is very sensitive to changes in physiology. Here we have performed targeted quantitative N-glycoproteomics from plasma samples of patients with confirmed positive blood culture together with age and sex matched febrile controls with negative blood culture reports. Three hundred and sixty eight potential N-glycopeptides were quantified by mass spectrometry and 149 were further selected for identification. Twenty four N-glycopeptides were identified with high confidence together with elucidation of the peptide sequence, N-glycosylation site, glycan composition and proposed glycan structures. Principal component analysis, orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (S-Plot) and self-organizing maps clustering among other statistical methods were employed to analyze the data.

Bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality with rates varying from 10–25% and higher. Appropriate and timely onset of antibiotic therapy influences the prognosis of these patients. It requires the diagnostic accuracy which is not afforded by current gold standards such as blood culture. Moreover, the time from blood sampling to blood culture results is a key determinant of reducing mortality. No established biomarkers exist which can differentiate bloodstream infections from other systemic inflammatory conditions. This calls for studies on biomarkers potential of molecular profiling of plasma as it is affected most by the molecular changes accompanying bloodstream infections. N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification which is very sensitive to changes in physiology. Here we have performed targeted quantitative N-glycoproteomics from plasma samples of patients with confirmed positive blood culture together with age and sex matched febrile controls with negative blood culture reports. Three hundred and sixty eight potential N-glycopeptides were quantified by mass spectrometry and 149 were further selected for identification. Twenty four N-glycopeptides were identified with high confidence together with elucidation of the peptide sequence, N-glycosylation site, glycan composition and proposed glycan structures. Principal component analysis, orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (S-Plot) and self-organizing maps clustering among other statistical methods were employed to analyze the data. These methods gave us clear separation of the two patient classes. We propose high-confidence N-glycopeptides which have the power to separate the bloodstream infections from blood culture negative febrile patients and shed light on host response during bacteremia.

Patient-nominated supporters can potentially improve the continuum of HIV care. We retrospectively determined factors associated with having a patient-nominated supporter among people living with HIV (PLWH), and its association with retention in care and viral suppression. We analysed registries of adults evaluated by social workers (n = 1345) at a referral hospital in Peru between 2011–2014. Nondisclosure of HIV status was associated with lacking supporters (aPR: 5.41, 95% CI: 3.83–7.64). Retention in care was 76.4% and 34.2% after one and two years of enrolment, respectively. PLWH with supporters were more likely to be retained in care after two years (aRR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02–1.81), but not after one year (aRR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.98–1.23) compared to PLWH without supporters. Having supporters who were parents or friends was associated with an increased probability of being retained in care after one and two years of enrolment. Viral suppression after one year of enrolment was 58.7%. Having a supporter was not associated with viral suppression (aRR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.99–1.41), but PLWH with supporters were more likely to have viral load measurements (p = 0.005). Patient-nominated supporters appear beneficial for engagement in HIV care; these benefits may be related to the nature of their relationship with PLWH.</content></content><author><name>Mateo Prochazka</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mateo Prochazka, Larissa Otero, Kelika A.

These results establish the oldest repository of MSA artifacts in eastern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03604-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Spatially heterogeneous dynamics in a metallic glass forming liquid imaged by electron correlation microscopy</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03604-2</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16240323431:2a0aff9:9f3b30f2</id><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03604-2</originId><published>1521442800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bfedf7ea</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/e5dtfyxt5SI/s41467-018-03604-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spatially heterogeneous dynamics in a metallic glass forming liquid imaged by electron correlation microscopy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatially heterogeneous dynamics in a metallic glass forming liquid imaged by electron correlation microscopy, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03604-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03604-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Glass forming liquids near the glass transition exhibit spatially heterogeneous dynamics, but it remains challenging to study their dynamics and structural origin on an atomic scale.

Ultra-precision face turning of Al6061 mirrors using single point diamond turning (SPDT) was undertaken to investigate the correlation between the surface roughness and reflectance. By reducing the feed rate, the optimal feed rate when the chip formation became unstable was studied. Most importantly, the impact on the roughness and reflectance was examined when the chip formation ceased to be continuous. It was determined that for a feed rate below 3 mm/min, the surface roughness always improved as the feed rate decreased, at the cost of a reduction of the normalized reflectance. The reduction of reflectance was determined to be the result of the lower material removal rates that led to a discontinuous chip formation.</content></content><author><name>L. H.

P5B ATPases are present in the genomes of diverse unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, indicating that they have an ancient origin, and that they are important for cellular fitness. Inactivation of ATP13A2, one of the four human P5B ATPases, leads to early-onset Parkinson’s disease (Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome). The presence of an invariant PPALP motif within the putative substrate interaction pocket of transmembrane segment M4 suggests that all P5B ATPases might have similar transport specificity; however, the identity of the transport substrate(s) remains unknown. Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis possess three paralogous P5B ATPase genes, &lt;i&gt;catp-5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;catp-6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-7&lt;/i&gt;, which probably originated from a single ancestral gene around the time of origin of the Caenorhabditid clade. By using CRISPR/Cas9, we have systematically investigated the expression patterns, subcellular localization and biological functions of each of the P5B ATPases of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We find that each gene has a unique expression pattern, and that some tissues express more than one P5B. In some tissues where their expression patterns overlap, different P5Bs are targeted to different subcellular compartments (e.g., early endosomes vs. plasma membrane), whereas in other tissues they localize to the same compartment (plasma membrane). We observed lysosomal co-localization between CATP-6::GFP and LMP-1::RFP in transgenic animals; however, this was an artifact of the tagged LMP-1 protein, since anti-LMP-1 antibody staining of native protein revealed that LMP-1 and CATP-6::GFP occupy different compartments. The nematode P5Bs are at least partially redundant, since we observed synthetic sterility in &lt;i&gt;catp-5(0); catp-6(0)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-6(0) catp-7(0)&lt;/i&gt; double mutants. The double mutants exhibit defects in distal tip cell migration that resemble those of &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt; (alpha integrin ortholog) and &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; (Pax6 ortholog) mutants, suggesting that the nematode P5Bs are required for &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt;and/or &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; function. This is potentially a conserved regulatory interaction, since mammalian ATP13A2, alpha integrin and Pax6 are all required for proper dopaminergic neuron function.</content></content><author><name>Jeffrey Zielich</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeffrey Zielich, Elena Tzima, Eva Ayla Schröder, Faten Jemel, Barbara Conradt, Eric J.

Wind has a significant effect on the control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), resulting in changes in their ground speed and direction, which has an important influence on the results of integrated optimization of UAV task allocation and path planning. The objective of this integrated optimization problem changes from minimizing flight distance to minimizing flight time. In this study, the Euclidean distance between any two targets is expanded to the Dubins path length, considering the minimum turning radius of fixed-wing UAVs. According to the vector relationship between wind speed, UAV airspeed, and UAV ground speed, a method is proposed to calculate the flight time of UAV between targets. On this basis, a variable-speed Dubins path vehicle routing problem (VS-DP-VRP) model is established with the purpose of minimizing the time required for UAVs to visit all the targets and return to the starting point. By designing a crossover operator and mutation operator, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, the results of which show that an effective UAV task allocation and path planning solution under steady wind can be provided.</content></content><author><name>He Luo</name></author><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by He Luo, Zhengzheng Liang, Moning Zhu, Xiaoxuan Hu, Guoqiang Wang&lt;/p&gt;

The process of selecting individual trees by humans for forest management purposes is the result of a plethora of factors and processes that are hard to disentangle. And yet in the past many textbooks and other publications have maintained that this selection leads to somewhat unanimous results. In this study, we analysed the data of 36 so-called marteloscope experiments from all over Britain, which are managed by the Ae Training Centre (Scotland, UK). Our objective was (1) to establish how much agreement there actually was when asking test persons (raters) to apply two different thinning methods, low and crown thinning. In addition we (2) were interested in understanding some of the processes leading to certain levels of agreement and in relationships between the agreement measures and characteristics of forest structure. Our analysis was based on multivariate statistics, particularly using Fleiss’ kappa. This was the first time that an analysis of rater behaviour was performed at such a large scale and it revealed that the general agreement in tree selection in Britain was only slight to fair, i.e. much lower than in medical experiments. The variability of selecting individual trees was considerable. We also found that agreement in tree selection was much stronger in low-thinning as opposed to crown-thinning experiments. As the latter is an important method of Continuous Cover Forestry and British forestry is increasingly adopting this forest management type, our results suggested that there is a need to provide more training. Interestingly the different levels of agreement as identified by Fleiss’ kappa could not be explained by measures of forest structure, however, the mean conformity number, a surrogate of Fleiss’ kappa, showed correlations and indicated that conformity increased with increasing complexity of tree stem diameter structure.</content></content><author><name>Arne Pommerening</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arne Pommerening, Carlos Pallarés Ramos, Wojciech Kędziora, Jens Haufe, Dietrich Stoyan&lt;/p&gt;

Interestingly the different levels of agreement as identified by Fleiss’ kappa could not be explained by measures of forest structure, however, the mean conformity number, a surrogate of Fleiss’ kappa, showed correlations and indicated that conformity increased with increasing complexity of tree stem diameter structure.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>An incoherent feedforward loop facilitates adaptive tuning of gene expression</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32323</link><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16295c56e9c:a2cdea9:34f43e70</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32323</canonicalUrl><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32323</originId><crawled>1522931166876</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Genomics and Evolutionary Biology</item></keywords><fingerprint>988e673a</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>We studied adaptive evolution of gene expression using long-term experimental evolution of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; in ammonium-limited chemostats.

In this study, effects of continuous cropping on soil properties, enzyme activities, and relative abundance, community composition and diversity of fungal taxa were investigated. Rhizosphere soil from field continuously cropped for one-year, three-year and five-year by &lt;i&gt;Coptis chinensis&lt;/i&gt; Franch. was collected and analyzed. Illumina high-throughput sequencing analysis showed that continuous cropping of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;chinensis&lt;/i&gt; resulted in a significant and continuous decline in the richness and diversity of soil fungal population. Ascomycota, Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota were the dominant phyla of fungi detected in rhizosphere soil. Fungal genera such as &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Volutella&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pachycudonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Heterodermia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gibberella&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cladosporium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trichocladium&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Sporothri&lt;/i&gt;x, were more dominant in continuously cropped samples for three-year and five-year compared to that for one-year. By contrast, genera, such as &lt;i&gt;Zygosaccharomyces&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudotaeniolina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hydnum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Umbelopsis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Humicola&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Crustoderma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Psilocybe&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coralloidiomyces&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mortierella&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Polyporus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pyrenula&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Monographella&lt;/i&gt; showed higher relative abundance in one-year samples than that in three-year and five-year samples. Cluster analysis of the fungal communities from three samples of rhizosphere soil from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;chinensis&lt;/i&gt; field revealed that the fungal community composition, diversity, and structure were significantly affected by the continuous cropping. Continuous cropping of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;chinensis&lt;/i&gt; also led to significant declines in soil pH, urease, and catalase activities.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In 2009, China officially launched the New Health Care Reform (NHCR). One important purpose of the reform was to reduce financial burden of health care through health insurance expansion and health care provider regulations. This study aimed to provide evidence on the effect of the NHCR reform on catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) by comparing the occurrence and inequality of CHE among households with chronic diseases patients before and after the reform.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study used the subset of data from the 2008 and 2013 National Health Services Survey conducted in Shaanxi Province. Our sample included households with chronic diseases patients and excluded observations with key variables missing. The final sample size was 1942 households in 2008 and 7704 households in 2013. We defined CHE occurrence following the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO). The income-related inequality in CHE was measured by the concentration index. A multi-level logistic regression model was used in the study to explore the influence of the NHCR on CHE occurrence, controlling for important covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2008 to 2013, the occurrence rate of CHE in rural areas declined from 29.15% to 23.62%. However, the CHE rate in urban areas increased from 19.18% to 24.95%. The interaction term between year and rural/urban location was statistically significant, confirming that the influence of the NHCR on the CHE occurrence rates were heterogeneous between rural and urban areas. As for the CHE inequality, the concentration index in rural areas decreased from -0.4572 to -0.5499 with a p-value less than 0.05. This implied that the CHE occurrence inequality was increased after the implementation of the NHCR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study suggested that the implementation of the NHCR might not have been effective in reducing the CHE occurrence for households with chronic disease patients. Although the occurrence of CHE of rural households had decreased, the occurrence of CHE in urban areas was higher than before.

This method demonstrates the advantage of utilizing publicly available data for functional genomics research.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Versatile approach for functional analysis of human proteins and efficient stable cell line generation using FLP-mediated recombination system</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194887</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4247:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194887</originId><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f6d0d0c8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194887</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Roman J.

Deciphering a function of a given protein requires investigating various biological aspects. Usually, the protein of interest is expressed with a fusion tag that aids or allows subsequent analyses. Additionally, downregulation or inactivation of the studied gene enables functional studies. Development of the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology opened many possibilities but in many cases it is restricted to non-essential genes. Recombinase-dependent gene integration methods, like the Flp-In system, are very good alternatives. The system is widely used in different research areas, which calls for the existence of compatible vectors and efficient protocols that ensure straightforward DNA cloning and generation of stable cell lines. We have created and validated a robust series of 52 vectors for streamlined generation of stable mammalian cell lines using the FLP recombinase-based methodology. Using the sequence-independent DNA cloning method all constructs for a given coding-sequence can be made with just three universal PCR primers. Our collection allows tetracycline-inducible expression of proteins with various tags suitable for protein localization, FRET, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), protein dynamics studies (FRAP), co-immunoprecipitation, the RNA tethering assay and cell sorting. Some of the vectors contain a bidirectional promoter for concomitant expression of miRNA and mRNA, so that a gene can be silenced and its product replaced by a mutated miRNA-insensitive version. Our toolkit and protocols have allowed us to create more than 500 constructs with ease. We demonstrate the efficacy of our vectors by creating stable cell lines with various tagged proteins (numatrin, fibrillarin, coilin, centrin, THOC5, PCNA). We have analysed transgene expression over time to provide a guideline for future experiments and compared the effectiveness of commonly used inducers for tetracycline-responsive promoters. As proof of concept we examined the role of the exoribonuclease XRN2 in transcription termination by RNAseq.</content></content><author><name>Roman J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Maternal morbidity and mortality is still a major public health issue in low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Improving access to antenatal care (ANC) services for pregnant women has been widely recognized as one of the most effective means of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity. As such, this study examined the barriers for pregnant women living in rural, agricultural villages to accessing ANC based on data collected in the Ratanakiri province, one of the least developed provinces in Cambodia, using a combination of a community-based cross-sectional survey and a geographic information system (GIS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 377 mothers with children under the age of two living in 62 villages in the Ratanakiri province, Cambodia, in December 2015. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to ask mothers about their ANC service use, knowledge of ANC, barriers to accessing health facilities, and complications they experienced during the most recent pregnancy. At the same time, GIS data were also collected using a Global Positioning System (GPS) to accurately measure actual travel distance of pregnant women to access health facilities and to examine geographical and environmental barriers in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Only a third of the mothers met the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) of receiving ANC four times or more (achieved ANC4+), and a quarter of the mothers had never received ANC during their most recent pregnancy. Factors positively associated with achieving ANC4+ were mother’s secondary or higher education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.74, 17.37), being aware that receiving ANC is recommended (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.25, 6.00), and knowledge about the recommended frequency for ANC (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI: 7.22). Actual travel distance was negatively associated with achieving ANC4+. Mothers who had to travel 10.0–14.9 km were 68% less likely (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.99), and those who had to travel 15.0 km or longer were 79% less likely (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.62) to have achieved ANC 4+, both compared to those who travelled 5.0 km or less. While most previous studies have used a straight-line to measure distance traveled, this study much more accurately measured the actual distance traveled by using a GIS. As a result, there was a statistically significant discrepancy between actual travel distance and straight-line distance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study revealed promoting factors and barriers for ANC use among pregnant women living in remote, agricultural villages in Cambodia. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of measuring travel distances accurately to ensure that targeted interventions for ANC are not misguided by straight-line distances. The methodology used in this study can be applied widely to other developing countries, especially in remote areas with limited road networks where there may be a large discrepancy between actual and straight-line distances.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Junko Yasuoka</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junko Yasuoka, Keiko Nanishi, Kimiyo Kikuchi, Sumihiro Suzuki, Po Ly, Boukheng Thavrin, Tsutomu Omatsu, Tetsuya Mizutani&lt;/p&gt;

The methodology used in this study can be applied widely to other developing countries, especially in remote areas with limited road networks where there may be a large discrepancy between actual and straight-line distances.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Silicon clears a wet path to phosphines</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-j?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:4150431:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1373.10.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-j?rss=1</originId><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><fingerprint>66138e81</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-j?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><published>1521740379000</published></item><item><engagement>2</engagement><title>Note on the quadratic penalties in elastic weight consolidation [Biological Sciences]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2496.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1622099e6cb:66132f:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/11.cover-source.jpg?itok=6otwVeit</url><width>359</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>480</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2496</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2496.short?rss=1</originId><published>1520961998000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Letters</item></keywords><fingerprint>dba2ddb9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2496.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Catastrophic forgetting is an undesired phenomenon which occurs when neural networks are trained on different tasks sequentially.

Human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3) proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the conversion of deoxycytidine (dC) to deoxyuridine (dU) in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis—for example, A3G deaminates the third dC in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy using the protection of telomeres protein 1 (Pot1) which has nanomolar affinity for ssDNA, with which we captured an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We crystallized a non-preferred adenine in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G. The structure reveals a unique conformation of the catalytic site loops that sheds light onto how the enzyme scans substrate in the -1 pocket. Furthermore, our biochemistry and virology studies provide evidence that the nucleotide-binding pockets on A3G influence each other in selecting the preferred DNA substrate. Together, the results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.</content></content><author><name>Samantha J.

Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)&gt;14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1). The total weight loss achieved in the maintainers (27 of 73 study participants) two years after the intervention had finished was 6.54 kg (4.47 kg+2.0 kg). The non-maintainers, on the other hand, returned to their initial weight at the start of the intervention (+0.21 kg). In multivariable analysis baseline history of increased glucose (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–13.6) and reduction of total fat in diet during follow-up (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.5–12.2) were independent predictors of successful weight loss. Further studies exploring predictors of weight loss maintenance in diabetes prevention are needed to help health care providers to redesign interventions and improve long-term outcomes of real life interventions.</content></content><author><name>Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska</name></author><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska, Noël C.

We measured time-resolved transcriptome-wide gene expression for wild type and cyclin single and double knockouts over cell cycle with and without osmotic stress. Clustering of expression profiles, peak-time detection of oscillating genes, integration with transcription factor network dynamics, and assignment to cell cycle phases allowed us to quantify the effect of genetic or stress perturbations on the duration of cell cycle phases. Cln1 and Cln2 showed functional differences, especially affecting later phases. Deletion of Cln3 led to a delay of START followed by normal progression through later phases. Our data and network analysis suggest mutual effects of cyclins with the transcriptional regulators SBF and MBF.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Small group gender ratios impact biology class performance and peer evaluations</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195129</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f59:34f43e70</id><updated>1522789200000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195129</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195129</originId><published>1522789200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bb7961bc</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195129</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lauren L.

Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Evidence suggests the microclimate of the classroom is an important factor influencing female course grades and interest, which encourages retention of women in STEM fields. Here, we test whether the gender composition of small (8–9 person) learning groups impacts course performance, sense of social belonging, and intragroup peer evaluations of intellectual contributions. Across two undergraduate active learning courses in introductory biology, we manipulated the classroom microclimate by varying the gender ratios of learning groups, ranging from 0% female to 100% female. We found that as the percent of women in groups increased, so did overall course performance for all students, regardless of gender. Additionally, women assigned higher peer- evaluations in groups with more women than groups with less women. Our work demonstrates an added benefit of the retention of women in STEM: increased performance for all, and positive peer perceptions for women.</content></content><author><name>Lauren L.

Adherent cells sense the physical properties of their environment via focal adhesions. Improved understanding of how cells sense and response to their physical surroundings is aided by quantitative evaluation of focal adhesion size, number, orientation, and distribution in conjunction with the morphology of single cells and the corresponding nuclei. We developed a fast, user-friendly and automated image analysis algorithm capable of capturing and characterizing these individual components with a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the algorithm by quantifying morphological changes in response to a variety of environmental changes as well as manipulations of cellular components of mechanotransductions. Finally, as a proof-of-concept we use our algorithm to quantify the effect of Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632 on focal adhesion maturation.

We conducted a document analysis that explored publication ethics and authorship in the context of population biobanks from both a theoretical (e.g. normative documents) and practical (e.g. biobank-specific documentation) perspective. The aim was to provide an overview of the state of authorship attribution in population biobanks and attempt to fill the gap in discussions around the issue. Our findings demonstrate that the most common approach adopted in both the normative and biobank-specific documentation is acknowledgment. A co-authorship approach was second and highlighted concerns surrounding the fairness of imposing authorship of the scientific leadership as a condition to access data and biosamples, as well as the alignment with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ criteria such as what is deemed a significant contribution and how to ensure accountability. Based on these findings, we propose a three-prong approach, that may be cumulative, to address the issue of authorship attribution in the context of population biobanks, namely 1) the biobank should be appropriately acknowledged; 2) an invitation for co-authorship should be made based on the spirit of collaboration and provided a substantial contribution has been made; and 3) a citation/referencing option should be available.</content></content><author><name>Erika Kleiderman</name></author><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erika Kleiderman, Amy Pack, Pascal Borry, Ma’n Zawati&lt;/p&gt;

Based on these findings, we propose a three-prong approach, that may be cumulative, to address the issue of authorship attribution in the context of population biobanks, namely 1) the biobank should be appropriately acknowledged; 2) an invitation for co-authorship should be made based on the spirit of collaboration and provided a substantial contribution has been made; and 3) a citation/referencing option should be available.</description></item><item><engagement>19</engagement><title>Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1622a609c4a:ba1f76:34f43e70</id><recrawled>1521130681627</recrawled><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y</originId><published>1521097200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03171-y/d41586-018-03171-y_15530340.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><fingerprint>97f70333</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03171-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Reforms put in place after Ebola epidemic in West Africa have built Nigeria&apos;s capacity to diagnose diseases and track their spread.</content></content><author><name>Amy Maxmen</name></author><crawled>1521129397322</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly Lassa-fever outbreak tests Nigeria&apos;s revamped health agency, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03171-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03171-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Reforms put in place after Ebola epidemic in West Africa have built Nigeria&apos;s capacity to diagnose diseases and track their spread.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Successional dynamics of marine fouling hydroids (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) at a finfish aquaculture facility in the Mediterranean Sea</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195352</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76936:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1522702800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195352</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195352</originId><published>1522702800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cbb54754</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195352</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luis Martell, Roberta Bracale, Steven A.

Aquaculture is increasing rapidly to meet global seafood demand. Some hydroid populations have been linked to mortality and health issues in finfish and shellfish, but their dynamics in and around aquaculture farms remain understudied. In the present work, two experiments, each with 36 panels, tested colonization (factors: depth, season of immersion) and succession (factors: depth, submersion duration) over one year. Hydroid surface cover was estimated for each species, and data were analyzed with multivariate techniques. The assemblage of hydrozoans was species-poor, although species richness, frequency and abundance increased with time, paralleling the overall increase in structural complexity of fouling assemblages. Submersion duration and season of immersion were particularly important in determining the species composition of the assemblages in the succession and colonization experiments, respectively. Production of water-borne propagules, including medusae, from the hydroids was observed from locally abundant colonies, among them the well-known fouling species &lt;i&gt;Obelia dichotoma&lt;/i&gt;, potentially representing a nuisance for cultured fish through contact-driven envenomations and gill disorders. The results illustrate the potential importance of fouling hydroids and their medusae to the health of organisms in the aquaculture industry.</content></content><author><name>Luis Martell</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luis Martell, Roberta Bracale, Steven A.

Analyzing extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an attractive approach to diagnosis of prostate diagnosis. However, existing methods of EVs isolation have low efficiency, purity, and long process time, and therefore have low diagnostic ability. To solve these the problems, a two-phase system is adapted to isolate EVs from a patient’s urine. Urine from 20 prostate cancer (PCA) patients and 10 benign prostate hyperplasia patients was used to quantify the EVs-isolation ability of an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) and to compare the diagnostic ability of ATPS with that of the conventional diagnosis method. An optimized ATPS isolates EVs with ~100% efficiency within ~30 min, with 14 times as high as achieved by ultracentrifugation. Afterward, PCR and ELISA are used to detect EVs derived from PCA cells in urine. The results demonstrate that diagnostic ability based on ATPS is better than other conventional diagnostic methods. ATPS can obtain a high quality and quantity of EVs from patients’ urine. EVs contain cancer-related protein and genes, so these abundant sources enable diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, ATPS is a useful tool to increase the specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis.</content></content><author><name>Hyunwoo Shin</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunwoo Shin, Yong Hyun Park, Yong-Goo Kim, Ji Youl Lee, Jaesung Park&lt;/p&gt;

It has been suggested that some cancer cells rely upon fatty acid oxidation (FAO) for energy. Here we show that when FAO was reduced approximately 90% by pharmacological inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) with low concentrations of etomoxir, the proliferation rate of various cancer cells was unaffected. Efforts to pharmacologically inhibit FAO more than 90% revealed that high concentrations of etomoxir (200 μM) have an off-target effect of inhibiting complex I of the electron transport chain. Surprisingly, however, when FAO was reduced further by genetic knockdown of &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt;, the proliferation rate of these same cells decreased nearly 2-fold and could not be restored by acetate or octanoic acid supplementation. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns had altered mitochondrial morphology and impaired mitochondrial coupling, whereas cells in which CPT1 had been approximately 90% inhibited by etomoxir did not. Lipidomic profiling of mitochondria isolated from &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns showed depleted concentrations of complex structural and signaling lipids. Additionally, expression of a catalytically dead &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns did not restore mitochondrial coupling. Taken together, these results suggest that transport of at least some long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria by CPT1 may be required for anabolic processes that support healthy mitochondrial function and cancer cell proliferation independent of FAO.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xb9CFXhgCsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Cong-Hui Yao</name></author><crawled>1522346087236</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cong-Hui Yao, Gao-Yuan Liu, Rencheng Wang, Sung Ho Moon, Richard W.

Worldwide tree mortality as induced by climate change presents a challenge to forest managers. To successfully manage vulnerable forests requires the capacity of regeneration to compensate for losses from tree mortality. We observed rapid regeneration and the growth release of young trees after warming-induced mortality in a David aspen-dominated (&lt;i&gt;Populus davidiana&lt;/i&gt;) broad-leaved forest in Inner Mongolia, China, as based on individual tree measurements taken in 2012 and 2015 from a 6-ha permanent plot. Warming and drought stress killed large trees 10–15 m tall with a total number of 2881 trees during 2011–2012, and also thinned the upper crowns. David aspen recruitment increased 2 times during 2012–2015 and resulted in a high transition probability of David aspen replacing the same or other species, whereas the recruitment of Mongolian oak (&lt;i&gt;Quercus mongolica&lt;/i&gt;) was much lower: it decreased from 2012 to 2015, indicating that rapid regeneration represented a regrowth phase for David aspen, and not succession to Mongolian oak. Further, we found that the recruitment density increased with canopy openness, thus implying that warming-induced mortality enhanced regeneration. Our results suggest that David aspen has a high regrowth ability to offset individual losses from warming-induced mortality. This important insight has implications for managing this vulnerable forest in the semi-arid region of northern China.</content></content><author><name>Pengwu Zhao</name></author><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pengwu Zhao, Chongyang Xu, Mei Zhou, Bo Zhang, Peng Ge, Nan Zeng, Hongyan Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Despite evidence that the ability to taste is weakened by obesity and can be rescued with weight loss intervention, few studies have investigated the molecular effects of obesity on the taste system. Taste bud cells undergo continual turnover even in adulthood, exhibiting an average life span of only a few weeks, tightly controlled by a balance of proliferation and cell death. Recent data reveal that an acute inflammation event can alter this balance. We demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OTfX7eySHIY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Andrew Kaufman</name></author><crawled>1521567831627</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Kaufman, Ezen Choo, Anna Koh, Robin Dando&lt;/p&gt;

We demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OTfX7eySHIY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>42</engagement><title>Concern as HIV prevention strategy languishes</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1205?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d25148:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/1205.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1205?rss=1</originId><crawled>1521143966531</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Epidemiology, Medicine, Diseases, Virology</item></keywords><fingerprint>d655e9cf</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1205?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Cohen, J.</name></author><published>1521135592000</published></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Murine knockin model for progranulin-deficient frontotemporal dementia with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [Neuroscience]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2849.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6ea:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/12/E2849/F1.medium.gif</url><width>440</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>285</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2849</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2849.short?rss=1</originId><published>1521567126000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>be7aedd9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2849.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in individuals under age 60 and has no treatment or cure.

Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a risk factor of osteoporotic fracture (OF). Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) can differentiate into osteoclasts to resorb bone. It was known that PBM-expressed Anxa2 protein is associated with BMD, and extracellular Anxa2 protein promotes osteoclastogenesis. This study aimed to test 1) whether Anxa2 protein level in PBM differs significantly between subjects with OF and without fracture history (NF); 2) whether Anxa2 level in plasma is associated with BMD; 3) how Anxa2 protein at various concentrations would affect osteoblastic activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. All the study subjects were Chinese Han elderly. Firstly, Anxa2 protein in PBM was identified and quantitated by LC-MS/MS and compared between 45 OF cases and 42 healthy controls. Secondly, plasma Anxa2 protein level was quantitated by ELISA and compared between unrelated subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD (0.63±0.10 vs. 1.05±0.10 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, n = 75). Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; functional assay was utilized to test the effects of extracellular Anxa2 protein on osteoblastic growth. We found that Anxa2 protein expression in PBM was significantly up-regulated in OF vs. NF subjects (fold change [FC)] = 1.16, P&amp;lt;0.05). Plasma Anxa2 protein concentration (range: 31.69–227.35ng/ml) was significantly elevated in low vs. high BMD subjects (84.85 vs. 66.15ng/ml, FC = 1.28, P&amp;lt;0.05). Cellular dynamical monitoring demonstrated that the general shape of dose-response relationship is the inverse U-shaped curve. Specifically, lower dose of Anxa2 protein may promote osteoblast growth and the optimal concentration for osteoblastic growth was around 50ng/ml, but even higher concentration could attenuate hFOB1.19 osteoprogenitor cell growth. We concluded that Anxa2 protein could attenuate osteoblast growth and be associated with hip BMD and OF in Chinese elderly.</content></content><author><name>Xu Zhou</name></author><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Wen-Yu Wang, Xin Lu, Zhen-Huan Jiang, Yun-Hong Zhang, Ding-Hua Jiang, Jian-Nong Jiang, Hong-Qing Gao, Shu-Feng Lei, Fei-Yan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, high-level shape concepts such as topology or boundary smoothness are hard if not impossible to encode in Feedforward Neural Networks. Here we present a modular strategy for the accurate segmentation of neural cell bodies from light-sheet microscopy combining deep learning and topology-preserving geometric deformable models. We show that the network can be trained efficiently from simple cell centroid annotations, and that the final segmentation provides accurate detection and smooth segmentations, without introducing cell splitting or merging.</description></item><item><engagement>38</engagement><title>On Lies, and Liars</title><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13329</link><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16229d4324f:ad6197:9f3b30f2</id><recrawled>1521122754124</recrawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/15/on-lies-and-liars</canonicalUrl><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13329</originId><published>1521119784000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Business and Markets</item><item>Chem/Bio Warfare</item><item>Current Events</item><item>Press Coverage</item><item>The Dark Side</item></keywords><fingerprint>b70de374</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>]\Today’s topic is “lies”.

We will start with the cases of Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh (“Sunny”) Balwani, of Theranos. As the world knows, Theranos was not what it was represented to be – John Carreyrou of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; and his extraordinary demolition job on them showed that beyond doubt. But remember, those articles were devastating because they &lt;em&gt;told the truth about what was happening&lt;/em&gt;. In these times, it’s important to remember that truth exists, that it exists outside our opinions, and that no amount of spin, hype, and sheer bull keeps it from being the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s worth remembering as you see the clip below. This is Holmes on CNBC, after the accusations against Theranos had already started to come out. And what you’re seeing is a firehose of falsehoods, knowingly delivered straight into the camera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare what’s being said with what’s in the SEC’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp-pr2018-41-theranos-holmes.pdf&quot;&gt;recently released complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Holmes. She would bring in potential investors and at one point in the pitch have a drop of their blood taken for analysis in a Theranos machine – but that’s not what was used to analyze it. Because it couldn’t. As Carreyrou reported, the company was reliant on existing third-party instruments, because its own hardware never, ever became capable enough to live up to the company’s public statements about it. Holmes stated, over and over, that Theranos was able to run tests covering over 1,000 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes: they could actually run twelve. Holmes and the company explicitly stated that they bought no technology from third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors would also get a binder of slides, documents, and endorsements, featuring (among other things) letters with the logos of various prominent pharmaceutical companies about their clinical work with Theranos. Those companies did not write the letters – Theranos employees did, pasting in the corporate logos. Investors were told that Theranos had worked extensively with the Department of Defense, and that their machines had been deployed on medevac helicopters in Afghanistan, which was a total fabrication. Financial projections showed them rolling out their machines to hundreds of Walgreens stores, when Holmes knew, in detail, that Walgreens was already having serious doubts about dealing with Theranos at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes on. But it’s worth keeping all this in mind as you watch that interview – skip through it, and you’ll see Elizabeth Holmes clearly and confidently lying, utterly misrepresenting the facts of the situation, smiling, and then utterly misrepresenting them some more. With no apparent qualm and no particular affect other than that of a person making her righteous case with the facts on her side. It’s worth thinking about. Theranos raised more than $700 million from private investors through this sort of behavior. Most of us do not have anywhere near the level of nerve (among other qualities) needed to pull something like this off, nor would it occur to us to do so in the first place. But there are people among us who do it cheerful, as a character in H. G. Wells says about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturepage.com/read/waroftheworlds-144.html&quot;&gt;similar opportunity&lt;/a&gt; for human predation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I forgot to mention another point that I was thinking about. As the SEC complaint notes, Holmes (but not Balwani) has already agreed to penalties for their behavior – financial and operational ones. I have no desire to defend Martin Shkreli at all, but the fact that he is starting a seven-year prison sentence while Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani are walking around freely seems like an injustice. And no, I’m not suggesting letting Shkreli out. The other solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That may still be an option, though: the SEC has civil enforcement authority, but criminal prosecution is another matter. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to another set of lies, and that will be enough for one morning. As many will have seen, the British government has expelled a list of Russian diplomats over the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/08/a-poisoning-in-england-but-which-poison&quot;&gt;Skripal poisoning case&lt;/a&gt;. (I am no particular admirer of Theresa May, but her statement about this incident did her and the UK credit). The nerve agent &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i12/Nerve-agent-attack-on-spy-used-Novichok-poison.html&quot;&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; is a known Russian-developed “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent&quot;&gt;Novichok&lt;/a&gt;” compound, a newer variety of organophosphorus poison. While it is certainly possible that such a compound could have been produced by a third party, it would require a very dedicated one indeed, since no details of the structures or synthesis have ever appeared in the scientific literature. The chemistry of the organophosphorus nerve agents is not particularly difficult (as was remarked in that earlier post), but that’s if you &lt;em&gt;already know the optimized reactions and conditions&lt;/em&gt;. Doing route discovery on latest-generation nerve agents is not a casual undertaking, and anyone trying it outside of a very well-equipped lab setting is likely to die in the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart Cantrill’s Twitter feed this morning put me on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tobyperkinsmp/status/974219780021542912&quot;&gt;this exchange&lt;/a&gt; about the identification of the compound. Apparently there are a number of people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/03/the-novichok-story-is-indeed-another-iraqi-wmd-scam/&quot;&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; there’s no way that this compound could have been identified without a reference sample, there’s no proof that these are associated with Russian chemical warfare research, etc. Needless to say, I side with Clyde Davies in that Twitter exchange linked above. The evidence is extremely strong that this was a Russian operation, and the often-flippant response of the Russian authorities to the entire case does nothing to dispel that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already had comments on the earlier post throwing doubt and uncertainly about this case (and the earlier Litvinenko assassination, even). More of these may accrue to this post as well. Some of these may in fact be honest doubts from extremely skeptical onlookers – but others are surely lies. Smiling, straight-into-the-camera-lens lies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><crawled>1521120195151</crawled><description>]\Today’s topic is “lies”.

Investigating how recombination might modify gene order during the evolution has become a routine part of mitochondrial genome analysis. A new method of genomic maps analysis based on formal logic is described. The purpose of this method is to 1) use mitochondrial gene order of current taxa as datasets 2) calculate rearrangements between all mitochondrial gene orders and 3) reconstruct phylogenetic relationships according to these calculated rearrangements within a tree under the assumption of maximum parsimony. Unlike existing methods mainly based on the probabilistic approach, the main strength of this new approach is that it calculates all the exact tree solutions with completeness and provides logical consequences as highly robust results. Moreover, this method infers all possible hypothetical ancestors and reconstructs character states for all internal nodes of the trees. We started by testing our method using the deuterostomes as a study case. Then, with sponges as an outgroup, we investigated the evolutionary history of mitochondrial genomes of 47 bilaterian phyla and emphasised the peculiar case of chaetognaths. This pilot work showed that the use of formal logic in a hypothetico-deductive background such as phylogeny (where experimental testing of hypotheses is impossible) is very promising to explore mitochondrial gene order in deuterostomes and should be applied to many other bilaterian clades.</content></content><author><name>Laurent Oxusoff</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurent Oxusoff, Pascal Préa, Yvan Perez&lt;/p&gt;

Members of the &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; genus of mosquitoes are widely recognized as vectors of viral diseases. &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; is its most invasive species, and are known to carry viruses such as Dengue, Chikugunya and Zika. Its emerging importance puts &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; on the forefront of genetic interaction and evolution studies. However, a panel of suitable reference genes specific for this insect is as of now undescribed. Nine reference genes, namely &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;eEF1-γ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;eIF2α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PP2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPL32&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPS17&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PGK1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ILK&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;STK&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated. Expression patterns of the candidate reference genes were observed in a total of seventeen sample types, separated by stage of development and age. Gene stability was inferred from obtained quantification data through three widely cited evaluation algorithms i.e. BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder. No single gene showed a satisfactory degree of stability throughout all developmental stages.

Cadmium exposure can cause renal tubular dysfunction. Recent studies show that vitamin D can play multiple roles in the body. However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium. A total of 133 subjects living in control area and two cadmium polluted areas were included in the present study. Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D ≥ 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1–0.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1–1.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D &amp;lt; 30 ng/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed in those subjects living in cadmium polluted areas or with high level of UCd or BCd. Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium.</content></content><author><name>Xiao Chen</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiao Chen, Yan Dai, Zhongqiu Wang, Guoying Zhu, Xiaoqiang Ding, Taiyi Jin&lt;/p&gt;

Tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy are a diverse group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders pathologically defined by inclusions containing aberrantly aggregated, post-translationally modified tau. The tau pathology burden correlates with neurodegeneration and dementia observed in these diseases. The microtubule binding domain of tau is essential for its physiological functions in promoting neuronal cytoskeletal stability, however it is also required for tau to assemble into an amyloid structure that comprises pathological inclusions. A series of novel monoclonal antibodies were generated which recognize the second and fourth microtubule-binding repeat domain of tau, thus enabling the identification specifically of 4-repeat tau versus 3-/4-repeat tau, respectively. These antibodies are highly specific for tau and recognize pathological tau inclusions in human tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and in transgenic mouse models of tauopathies. These new antibodies will be useful for identifying and characterizing different tauopathies and as tools to target tau pathology in these diseases.</content></content><author><name>Cara L.

These new antibodies will be useful for identifying and characterizing different tauopathies and as tools to target tau pathology in these diseases.</description></item><item><engagement>187</engagement><title>First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162448dd1f2:30ca44e:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03445-5/d41586-018-03445-5_15548832.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5</originId><published>1521529200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3b72e644</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03445-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Scientists hope to learn what makes a ‘typical’ solar system from the European Space Agency’s €450-million probe.</content></content><author><name>Elizabeth Gibney</name></author><crawled>1521568567794</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03445-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Scientists hope to learn what makes a ‘typical’ solar system from the European Space Agency’s €450-million probe.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Optimization of alkaline extraction of hemicellulose from sweet sorghum bagasse and its direct application for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides by &amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&amp;lt;/i&gt; strain MR44</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b7:9aea0a7d</id><updated>1523394000000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</originId><published>1523394000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>15cb0e85</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lusha Wei, Tongjing Yan, Yifei Wu, Hui Chen, Baoshan Zhang&lt;/p&gt;
As predominant components of hemicelluloses in grasses, methylglucuroarabinoxylans (MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are sources for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides (U-XOS). &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; MR44, an engineered biocatalyst to secrete only the XynC xylanase and Axh43 arabinoxylan hydrolase is capable of processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively U-XOS. The present studies are directed at the explosion on direct alkaline extraction serving for production of U-XOS. Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize xylan extraction conditions on the sweet sorghum bagasse to achieve maximum hemicelluloses yield. The optimized condition was as follows: extraction time of 3.91 h, extraction temperature of 86.1°C, and NaOH concentration (w/w) of 12.33%. Crude xylan extracted with NaOH revealed a compositional analysis of xylose (79.0%), arabinose (5.3%), glucose (1.7%), lignin and ash (5.6%). After neutralization this xylan preparation supported growth of MR44, processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; from sweet sorghum and accumulating U-XOS. The quality of U-XOS produced by MR44 using alkaline-treated sweet sorghum bagasse was comparable to that obtained from purified MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Overall, the present study demonstrates that direct alkaline treatment of sweet sorghum bagasse is useful to improve the bioavailability of MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for MR44-mediated conversion to U-XOS with average degrees of polymerization of 11–12, providing alternative resources with applications in nutrition and human and veterinary medicine.</content></content><author><name>Lusha Wei</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lusha Wei, Tongjing Yan, Yifei Wu, Hui Chen, Baoshan Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Chronic stress is an important factor influencing people’s health. It usually causes endocrinal disorders and a decline in reproduction in females. Although studies of both human and animals suggest a detrimental effect of stress on reproduction, the influence of chronic stress on the ovarian reservation and follicular development is still not clear. In this study, a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of stress on ovarian reservation and follicular development and explore the underlying mechanism. In this study, after 8 weeks of CRS, primordial follicles were excessively activated in the ovaries of the CRS group compared with the control group. Further results showed that the activation of primordial follicles induced by CRS was involved in the increasing expression level of Kit ligand and its receptor Kit and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide released due to stress, which plays an important role in regulating follicle development. A high level of serum CRH was detected in the CRS mouse model, and the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the mRNA level of its main receptor CRHR1increased in the ovaries of the CRS mouse group. Moreover, 100nM CRH significantly improved the activation of primordial follicles in newborn mouse ovaries &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. These results demonstrated that CRS could induce immoderate activation of primordial follicles accompanied by the activation of Kit-PI3K signaling, in which CRH might be an important endocrine factor.</content></content><author><name>Minhua Xu</name></author><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Minhua Xu, Junyan Sun, Qian Wang, Qiuwan Zhang, Chunsheng Wei, Dongmei Lai&lt;/p&gt;

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) consist of a population of self-renewing cells displaying extensive phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Research towards the understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity among ESCs is still in its initial stage. Key issues, such as how to identify cell-subset specifically methylated loci and how to interpret the biological meanings of methylation variations remain largely unexplored. To fill in the research gap, we implemented a computational pipeline to analyze single-cell methylome and to perform an integrative analysis with single-cell transcriptome data. According to the origins of variation in DNA methylation, we determined the genomic loci associated with allelic-specific methylation or asymmetric DNA methylation, and explored a beta mixture model to infer the genomic loci exhibiting cell-subset specific methylation (CSM). We observed that the putative CSM loci in ESCs are significantly enriched in CpG island (CGI) shelves and regions with histone marks for promoter and enhancer, and the genes hosting putative CSM loci show wide-ranging expression among ESCs. More interestingly, the putative CSM loci may be clustered into co-methylated modules enriching the binding motifs of distinct sets of transcription factors. Taken together, our study provided a novel tool to explore single-cell methylome and transcriptome to reveal the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks associated with epigenetic heterogeneity of ESCs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f7Po2bpx1o8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yanting Luo</name></author><crawled>1521654476064</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanting Luo, Jianlin He, Xiguang Xu, Ming-an Sun, Xiaowei Wu, Xuemei Lu, Hehuang Xie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARα)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Egl nine homolog 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;EGLN3)&lt;/i&gt; play critical roles in facilitating the adaptation to a hypoxic environment. However, the relationship between &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; variants and hypoxic adaptation remains poorly understood in Tibetan chickens. To better understand the effects of genetic variation, we sequenced exons of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; in 138 Lowland chickens (LC) from 7 breeds that were located in Emei, Miyi, Shimian, Wanyuan, Pengxian, and Muchuan in the Sichuan province, and Wenchang in the Hainan province (altitudes for these locations are below 1800 meters). Total 166 Tibetan chickens (TC) from 7 subpopulations that were located in Shigatse, Lhoka, Lhasa, Garze, Aba, Diqing and Yushu in the Tibetan area were also sequenced (altitudes greater than 2700 meters). One single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs316017491, C &gt; T) was identified in &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and was shared by TC and LC with no significant difference for allele frequencies between them (P &gt; 0.05). Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP1, A29410G; SNP2, rs13886097; SNP3, T29467C; SNP4, rs735915170; SNP5, rs736599044; and SNP6, rs740077421) including one non-synonymous mutation (SNP2, T &gt; C) were identified in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. This is the first report of SNP1 and SNP3. There was a difference between TC and LC for allele frequencies (P &amp;lt;0.01), except for SNP1, SNP4, and SNP5) The fix index statistic test indicated that there was population differentiation between TC and LC for SNP2, SNP3, and SNP6 in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic distance among chickens, finch and great tit were close for both &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. Bioinformatics analysis of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; showed that SNP2 leads to an amino acid substitution of Ile for Met, which results in the protein being more likely to be hydrolyzed. Thus, genetic variation in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; may play a role in the ability of TC to adapt to a high altitude environment; however we were unable to identify a relationship between polymorphisms in &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and environmental adaptability.</content></content><author><name>ChengLin Zhong</name></author><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by ChengLin Zhong, SiChen Li, JingJing Li, FengPeng Li, MingXia Ran, LingYun Qiu, DiYan Li, Qing Zhu, Yan Wang, HuaDong Yin, Gang Shu, Chaowu Yang, XiaoLing Zhao&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, genetic variation in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; may play a role in the ability of TC to adapt to a high altitude environment; however we were unable to identify a relationship between polymorphisms in &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and environmental adaptability.</description></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><title>Water-like anomalies as a function of tetrahedrality [Applied Physical Sciences]</title><engagementRate>1.0</engagementRate><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162b12a08af:1e3e9:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/15/E3333/F1.medium.gif</url><width>440</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>278</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3333</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3333.short?rss=1</originId><published>1523386901000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3333.short?rss=1</link><fingerprint>697b61c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3333.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Tetrahedral interactions describe the behavior of the most abundant and technologically important materials on Earth, such as water, silicon, carbon, germanium, and countless others.

Recent vaccine studies with experimental antigens have shown that regulatory T cells (Tregs) constrain the magnitude of B cell responses. This homeostatic Treg-mediated suppression is thought to reduce the potential of germinal center (GC) responses to generate autoreactive antibodies. However, essentially opposite results were observed in live influenza infections where Tregs promoted B cell and antibody responses. Thus, it remains unclear whether Tregs dampen or enhance B cell responses, especially during live viral infections. Here, we use mice infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), which induces a robust expansion of Tregs. Depletion of Tregs led to elevated activation, proliferation, and class switching of B cells. In addition, Treg depletion enhanced the production of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies and reduced FV viremia. Thus, in contrast to influenza infection, Tregs either directly or indirectly suppress B cells during mouse retroviral infection indicating that the ultimate effect of Tregs on B cell responses is specific to the particular infectious agent.</content></content><author><name>Tyler C.

Social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections, Brexit, stock market, etc. In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data. Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set). We find no significant difference between the best cross-validation and sequential validation. However, we observe that all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance, while the sequential methods tend to underestimate it. Standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios.</content></content><author><name>Igor Mozetič</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Igor Mozetič, Luis Torgo, Vitor Cerqueira, Jasmina Smailović&lt;/p&gt;

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved therapy for treatment of epilepsy and depression. While also shown to be promising in several preclinical and clinical studies to treat cardiovascular diseases, optimal therapeutic stimulation paradigms are still under investigation. Traditionally, parameters such as frequency, current, and duty cycle are used to adjust the efficacy of VNS therapy. This study explored the effect of novel stochastic VNS (S-VNS) on acute heart rate (HR) dynamics. The effect of S-VNS was evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats by comparing the acute HR and HR variability (HRV) responses to standard, periodic VNS (P-VNS) across different frequencies (FREQs, 10–30 Hz). Our results demonstrate that both S-VNS and P-VNS produced negative chronotropic effects in a FREQ-dependent manner with S-VNS inducing a significantly smaller drop in HR at 10 Hz and 20 Hz compared to P-VNS (p&amp;lt;0.05). S-VNS demonstrated a FREQ-dependent drop in the SD1/SD2 ratio, a measure of HRV, which was absent in P-VNS, suggesting that S-VNS may acutely modulate the nonlinear relationship between short- and long-term HRV. In conclusion, S-VNS is a novel stimulation procedure that may provide different physiological outcomes from standard P-VNS, as indicated by our analysis of HR dynamics. Our study provides a rationale for further detailed investigations into the therapeutic potential of S-VNS as a novel neuromodulation technique.</content></content><author><name>Steven W.

In skeletal muscle the coordinated actions of two mechanically coupled Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels—the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1) and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1)–underlie the molecular mechanism of rapid cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] increase leading to contraction. While both [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and contractile activity have been implicated in the regulation of myogenesis, less is known about potential specific roles of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 and RYR1 in skeletal muscle development. In this study, we analyzed the histology and the transcriptomic changes occurring at E14.5 –the end of primary myogenesis and around the onset of intrauterine limb movement, and at E18.5 –the end of secondary myogenesis, in WT, RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; murine limb skeletal muscle. At E14.5 the muscle histology of both mutants exhibited initial alterations, which became much more severe at E18.5. Immunohistological analysis also revealed higher levels of activated caspase-3 in the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; muscles at E14.5, indicating an increase in apoptosis. With WT littermates as controls, microarray analyses identified 61 and 97 differentially regulated genes (DEGs) at E14.5, and 493 and 1047 DEGs at E18.5, in RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; samples, respectively.

In skeletal muscle the coordinated actions of two mechanically coupled Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels—the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1) and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1)–underlie the molecular mechanism of rapid cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] increase leading to contraction. While both [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and contractile activity have been implicated in the regulation of myogenesis, less is known about potential specific roles of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 and RYR1 in skeletal muscle development. In this study, we analyzed the histology and the transcriptomic changes occurring at E14.5 –the end of primary myogenesis and around the onset of intrauterine limb movement, and at E18.5 –the end of secondary myogenesis, in WT, RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; murine limb skeletal muscle. At E14.5 the muscle histology of both mutants exhibited initial alterations, which became much more severe at E18.5. Immunohistological analysis also revealed higher levels of activated caspase-3 in the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; muscles at E14.5, indicating an increase in apoptosis. With WT littermates as controls, microarray analyses identified 61 and 97 differentially regulated genes (DEGs) at E14.5, and 493 and 1047 DEGs at E18.5, in RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; samples, respectively. Gene enrichment analysis detected no overlap in the affected biological processes and pathways in the two mutants at E14.5, whereas at E18.5 there was a significant overlap of DEGs in both mutants, affecting predominantly processes linked to muscle contraction. Moreover, the E18.5 vs. E14.5 comparison revealed multiple genotype-specific DEGs involved in contraction, cell cycle and miRNA-mediated signaling in WT, neuronal and bone development in RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;, and lipid metabolism in Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; samples.

Background &lt;p&gt;Multiple drug resistant (MDR) intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are associated with notable direct and societal costs. As previous studies have not considered the impact of MDR on the total medical costs (TMCs) of IAIs, the present one examines this, as well as further estimates the additional costs at a national level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective study. Firstly, we randomly selected a sample of 40% of all inpatients discharged between 2014 and 2015 from a teaching hospital, due to limits in budget and the large number of patients. Then, we manually selected 254 patients with IAIs according to the International Classification of Disease, 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; revision, using electronic medical records. Eventually, 101 patients with IAIs (64 MDR patients and 37 non-MDR patients) were included after excluding cases without laboratory test results, any pathogens detected, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Univariate analysis and a generalized linear model were applied to assess the parameters associated with TMCs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to non-MDR patients, those with MDR pathogens were significantly associated with higher TMCs, higher antimicrobial costs, higher antimicrobial usage, larger number of pathogens, and longer length of stay and were more likely to have insurance and combination antimicrobial therapy. In addition, the average TMC among patients with MDR pathogens was ¥ 131801, which is ¥ 90201 higher than those without MDR pathogens. If our results are applied to the whole country, the sum of all attributable TMCs was ¥ 37 billion. The societal costs, furthermore, were ¥111 billion in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results provide information that should lead to increased efforts to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, in order to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens and to reduce their economic burden.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Xuemei Zhen</name></author><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuemei Zhen, Yuanyuan Li, Yixi Chen, Peng Dong, Stephanie Liu, Hengjin Dong&lt;/p&gt;

Further, we demonstrate that inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, used in cancer treatment, may increase the diversity of cellular responses, enhancing resistance to treatment.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Empirical approach to threshold determination for the delineation of built-up areas with road network data</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194806</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f0d:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1522184400000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194806</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194806</originId><published>1522184400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4fd4a592</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194806</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Qi Zhou, Lei Guo&lt;/p&gt;
Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of built-up areas for a wide range of applications. Recently developed approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of built-up areas using road network data. A series of experiments were designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard to different administrative regions and cities/towns. The results show that in most cases, the most-appropriate thresholds or ranges for different subdivisions are either identical or overlap—thus validating the use of the most-appropriate thresholds to delineate built-up areas for one or multiple small subdivisions and, by inference, for a much larger region.</content></content><author><name>Qi Zhou</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qi Zhou, Lei Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Rhizobacteria associated with crops constitute an important source of potentially beneficial microorganisms with plant growth promoting activity or antagonistic effects against phytopathogens. In this study, we evaluated the plant growth promoting activity of 11 bacterial isolates that were obtained from the rhizosphere of healthy avocado trees and from that of avocado trees having survived root rot infestations. Seven bacterial isolates, belonging to the genera &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arthrobacter&lt;/i&gt;, promoted &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. These isolates were then tested for antagonistic activity against &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt;, in direct dual culture assays. Two of those rhizobacterial isolates, obtained from symptomatic-declining trees, displayed antagonistic activity. Isolate A8a, which is closely related to &lt;i&gt;Bacillus acidiceler&lt;/i&gt;, was also able to inhibit &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; growth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by 76% through the production of volatile compounds. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) allowed to tentatively identify the main volatiles emitted by isolate A8a as 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, 6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-one and 3-amino-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one. These volatile compounds have been reported to show antifungal activity when produced by other bacterial isolates. These results confirm the significance of rhizobacteria and suggest that these bacteria could be used for biocontrol of soil borne oomycetes through their volatiles emissions.</content></content><author><name>Alfonso Méndez-Bravo</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfonso Méndez-Bravo, Elvis Marian Cortazar-Murillo, Edgar Guevara-Avendaño, Oscar Ceballos-Luna, Benjamín Rodríguez-Haas, Ana L.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;(1) To use finite element (FE) modelling to estimate local iris stresses (i.e. internal forces) as a result of mechanical pupil expansion; and to (2) compare such stresses as generated from several commercially available expanders (Iris hooks, APX dilator and Malyugin ring) to determine which design and deployment method are most likely to cause iris damage.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used a biofidelic 3-part iris FE model that consisted of the stroma, sphincter and dilator muscles. Our FE model simulated expansion of the pupil from 3 mm to a maximum of 6 mm using the aforementioned pupil expanders, with uniform circular expansion used for baseline comparison. FE-derived stresses, resultant forces and area of final pupil opening were compared across devices for analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our FE models demonstrated that the APX dilator generated the highest stresses on the sphincter muscles, (max: 6.446 MPa; average: 5.112 MPa), followed by the iris hooks (max: 5.680 MPa; average: 5.219 MPa), and the Malyugin ring (max: 2.144 MPa; average: 1.575 MPa). Uniform expansion generated the lowest stresses (max: 0.435MPa; average: 0.377 MPa). For pupil expansion, the APX dilator required the highest force (41.22 mN), followed by iris hooks (40.82 mN) and the Malyugin ring (18.56 mN).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study predicted that current pupil expanders exert significantly higher amount of stresses and forces than required during pupil expansion.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Qualitative studies indicated that cancer survivors may be worried about finding a partner in the future, but whether this concern is warranted is unknown. We examined single people´s interest in dating a cancer survivor, how they perceive survivors’ traits, and their preferences about the timing of disclosing a cancer history.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In three experimental vignette studies, dating website members (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 324) and college students (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 138 and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 131) were randomly assigned to a vignette of a person with or without a history of cancer (experiment 1 &amp;amp; 2), or a cancer survivor beyond or during active follow-up (experiment 3). Respondents rated their interest in dating this fictive person, this person’s traits, and indicated their preferences about the timing of disclosure. ANOVAs with main and interaction effects of condition, gender, and relationship history were conducted, partial eta squared and Cohen’s &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; were used to estimate the magnitude of effects. Correlations were used to investigate relationships between interest in a date and assessment of traits.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors’ traits were assessed more positively, but interest to date them did not differ from healthy vignettes for both men and women. However, widowed respondents were much less interested in a date with a cancer survivor, and women showed less interest in a cancer survivor during active follow-up relative to survivors beyond follow-up. Most respondents wanted to hear about the cancer diagnosis after a few dates, hardly anyone wanted to hear about this before the first date (2% - 5%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion and implications for cancer survivors &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors do not have to expect any more problems in finding a date than people without a cancer history, and can wait a few dates before disclosing.

Background &lt;p&gt;Data are lacking on the risk and impact of a serious hemorrhage on the prognosis after ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aimed to estimate the incidence of serious hemorrhage, analyze the impact on mortality, and identify predictors of hemorrhage after discharge from IS or TIA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;All patients admitted to Östersund Hospital for an IS or TIA in 2010–2013 were included (n = 1528, mean age: 75.1 years). Serious hemorrhages were identified until 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2015. Incidence rates were calculated. The impact on mortality (stratified by functional level) was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Non-parametric estimation under the assumption of competing risk was performed to assess the cumulative incidence and predictors of serious hemorrhages.The incidence rates of serious (n = 113) and intracranial hemorrhages (n = 45) after discharge from IS and TIA were 2.48% and 0.96% per year at risk, respectively. Patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 3–5 exhibited 58.9% mortality during follow-up and those with mRS scores of 0–2 exhibited 18.4% mortality. A serious hemorrhage did not affect mortality in patients with impaired functional status, but it increased the risk of death in patients with mRS scores of 0–2. Hypertension was associated with increased risk of serious hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found that, after discharge from an IS or TIA, serious hemorrhages were fairly common. Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability. Improved hypertension treatment may decrease the risk of serious hemorrhage, but in patients with low functional status, poor survival makes secondary prevention challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Joachim Ögren</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joachim Ögren, Anna-Lotta Irewall, Lars Söderström, Thomas Mooe&lt;/p&gt;

Hypertension was associated with increased risk of serious hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found that, after discharge from an IS or TIA, serious hemorrhages were fairly common. Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability. Improved hypertension treatment may decrease the risk of serious hemorrhage, but in patients with low functional status, poor survival makes secondary prevention challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Correction for Callier, Inner Workings: How the butterfly got its spots (and why it matters) [Correction]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E3065.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:635229a:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E3065.short?rss=1</originId><published>1522168915000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E3065</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>310c1086</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E3065.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>INNER WORKINGS Correction for “Inner Workings: How the butterfly got its spots (and why it matters),” by Viviane Callier, which was first published February 13, 2018; 10.1073/pnas.1722410115 (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 115:1397–1399).

Urinary type IV collagen (U-Col4) and albumin excretion is evaluated to monitor the development of diabetic kidney disease. However, U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, 1067 participants without diabetes and with urinary albumin-creatinine ratio &amp;lt;300 mg/gCr (normo- or microalbuminuria) who underwent an annual health examination in 2004 were enrolled and observed for 5 years. They were divided according to the amount of U-Col4 or urinary albumin excreted. The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. In participants with eGFR ≥80 mL/min, abnormal U-Col4 excretion was indicated as a significant independent risk factor for 10% eGFR change per year, which is one of the prognostic factors for the development of end-stage kidney disease. Moreover, in contrast to urinary albumin excretion, U-Col4 excretion was not related to age or kidney function, suggesting that some individuals with abnormal U-Col4 excretion can have an independent hidden risk for the development of kidney dysfunction. In conclusion, it is important to measure U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes to determine changes in renal features in every individual and help detect future complications such as diabetic kidney disease. If U-Col4 excretion is abnormal, kidney manifestation should be carefully followed up, even if the kidney function and urinalysis findings are normal.</content></content><author><name>Fumi Kishi</name></author><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fumi Kishi, Kojiro Nagai, Norimichi Takamatsu, Tatsuya Tominaga, Masanori Tamaki, Eriko Shibata, Taichi Murakami, Seiji Kishi, Hideharu Abe, Yasuhiko Koezuka, Naoto Minagawa, Go Ichien, Toshio Doi&lt;/p&gt;

The enigmatic introns of ribosomal proteins may prove to be a novel and vital link in this regulatory balancing act.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>B7-H1 maintains the polyclonal T cell response by protecting dendritic cells from cytotoxic T lymphocyte destruction [Immunology and Inflammation]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3126.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6ae:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/12.cover-source.jpg?itok=TO5q5WLS</url><width>359</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>480</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3126</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3126.short?rss=1</originId><published>1521567125000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ce5f50a6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3126.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Induced B7-H1 expression in the tumor microenvironment initiates adaptive resistance, which impairs immune functions and leads to tumor escape from immune destruction.

The high risk of experiencing domestic violence (DV) among married women in India who reside in slum communities underscores the need for effective, evidence-based, and culturally-tailored primary prevention. To inform such DV primary prevention strategies for this population, we herein aimed to identify correlates of DV experience in early marriage. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, potential correlates of DV experience were explored among a geographically-clustered random sample of 100 recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India. In multivariable regression, DV experience was associated with less educational attainment by the participant’s spouse (standardized β = -0.281, p = 0.004), less satisfaction of the spouse’s family with the &lt;i&gt;maanpaan&lt;/i&gt; (wedding-related gifts provided by the bride’s family) they received at the time of marriage (standardized β = -0.298, p&amp;lt;0.001), poorer conflict negotiation skills (standardized β = -0.308, p&amp;lt;0.001), and greater acknowledgement of DV occurrence in family and friends (standardized β = 0.436, p&amp;lt;0.001). These correlates suggest strategies that could be incorporated into future DV primary prevention interventions for this vulnerable population (i.e. promoting completion of formal education of boys alongside girls, mitigating causes of familial dowry harassment, improving conflict negotiation skills, and challenging norms surrounding DV).</content></content><author><name>Ameeta S.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the photochemical degradation of trypan blue (TB) and to identify decomposition products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Defined solution samples of TB and a mixture with lutein/zeaxanthin were exposed to blue light. Thermal degradation processes were ruled out using controls not subjected to irradiation. All samples were analyzed using optical microscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Degradation kinetics were determined based on changes in absorbance; intermediates were identified by analyzing mass differences of characteristic fragment ion peaks within the fragmentation patterns, and assignments were verified by NMR.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photochemical degradation, which can be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin. Intermediates vary depending on the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin. The self-sensitized photodegradation of TB occurs under generation of dimethyl sulfate and presumed formation of phenol. In contrast, within the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin the decomposition of TB indicates the formation of methoxyamine and sulfonyl arin. Thermal degradation processes were not observed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photodegradation that may be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin and results in the formation of cytotoxic decomposition products.

Gut bacterial communities have been shown to be influenced by diet, host phylogeny and anatomy, but most of these studies have been done in captive animals. Here we compare the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of wild birds. We characterized the gizzard and intestinal microbiota among 8 wild Neotropical bird species, granivorous or frugivorous species of the orders Columbiformes and Passeriformes. We sequenced the V4 region of the &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene in 94 collected samples from 32 wild birds from 5 localities, and compared bacterial communities by foraging guild, organ, locality and bird taxonomy. &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene-based sequencing data were examined using QIIME with linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and metabolic pathways were predicted using PICRUSt algorism. We identified 8 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Beta diversity analyses indicated significant separation of gut communities by bird orders (Columbiformes vs. Passerifomes) and between bird species (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In lower intestine, PICRUSt shows a predominance of carbohydrate metabolism in granivorous birds and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in frugivorous birds. Gizzard microbiota was significantly richer in granivorous, in relation to frugivorous birds (Chao 1; non-parametric t-test, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), suggesting a microbial gizzard function, beyond grinding food. The results suggest that the most important factor separating the bacterial community structure was bird taxonomy, followed by foraging guild. However, variation between localities is also likely to be important, but this could not been assessed with our study design.</content></content><author><name>M.

However, variation between localities is also likely to be important, but this could not been assessed with our study design.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>New tools for the analysis and validation of Cryo-EM maps and atomic models [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/279844v1?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16225c8caa4:51a668:9f3b30f2</id><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/14/279844</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/279844v1?rss=1</originId><published>1521010800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cc13d2e8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/279844v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Recent advances in the field of electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have resulted in a rapidly increasing number of atomic models of bio-macromolecules solved using this technique and deposited in the Protein Data Bank and the Electron Microscopy Data Bank.

Broad scale population estimates of declining species are desired for conservation efforts. However, for many secretive species including large carnivores, such estimates are often difficult. Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species’ entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world’s jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000–208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented. The high number of jaguars results from the large total area still occupied (almost 9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low human densities (&amp;lt; 1 person/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coinciding with high primary productivity in the core area of jaguar range. Our results show the importance of protected areas for jaguar persistence. We conclude that combining modelling of density and distribution can reveal ecological patterns and processes at global scales, can provide robust estimates for use in species assessments, and can guide broad-scale conservation actions.</content></content><author><name>Włodzimierz Jędrzejewski</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Włodzimierz Jędrzejewski, Hugh S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Heavy burden of child injuries and lack of policy response in Ethiopia call for an improved understanding of the situation and development of action plans from multiple governmental agencies and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A consortium of international and Ethiopian researchers and stakeholders used extensive literature review and mixed analytical methods to estimate and project the burden of fatal and non-fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2030. Estimates were derived for children aged 0–14 years. Data sources include a longitudinal study conducted by the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia and the World Bank as well as model-based estimates from World Health Organization 2017 and Global Burden of Disease 2016 project.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Injuries caused about 25 thousand deaths among 0-14-year olds in Ethiopia in 2015. The leading cause of fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia was road-traffic injuries, followed by fire, heat and hot substances and drowning. The death rate due to injuries among 0–14 years olds was about 50 percent higher in males than females. Rural children were exposed to a greater risk of injury than their urban peers. The longitudinal survey suggests that the incidence rate of child injuries increased during the period 2011–2014. The annual mortality caused by injuries is projected to increase from 10,697 in 2015 to 11,279 in 2020 and 11,989 in 2030 among children under 5 years, an increase of 12 percentage points in 15 years. The number of deaths among 0-14-year olds will be 26,463, 27,807, and 30,364 respectively in 2015, 2020, and 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;As the first multisectoral collaboration on child injuries in Ethiopia, this study identified gaps in understanding of the burden of child injuries in Ethiopia.

Our study addresses how environmental variables, such as macronutrients concentrations, snow cover, carbonate chemistry and salinity affect the photophysiology and biomass of Antarctic sea-ice algae. We have measured vertical profiles of inorganic macronutrients (phosphate, nitrite + nitrate and silicic acid) in summer sea ice and photophysiology of ice algal assemblages in the poorly studied Amundsen and Ross Seas sectors of the Southern Ocean. Brine-scaled bacterial abundance, chl &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and macronutrient concentrations were often high in the ice and positively correlated with each other. Analysis of photosystem II rapid light curves showed that microalgal cells in samples with high phosphate and nitrite + nitrate concentrations had reduced maximum relative electron transport rate and photosynthetic efficiency. We also observed strong couplings of PSII parameters to snow depth, ice thickness and brine salinity, which highlights a wide range of photoacclimation in Antarctic pack-ice algae. It is likely that the pack ice was in a post-bloom situation during the late sea-ice season, with low photosynthetic efficiency and a high degree of nutrient accumulation occurring in the ice. In order to predict how key biogeochemical processes are affected by future changes in sea ice cover, such as &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; photosynthesis and nutrient cycling, we need to understand how physicochemical properties of sea ice affect the microbial community.

The authors are going over a number of areas where medicinal chemistry could make use of more advanced synthetic techniques, and they’re good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, “&lt;em&gt;From an industry perspective, the most common challenge for any new synthetic method is its level of tolerance to the polar functional groups and nitrogen heteroatoms found in biologically active molecules.&lt;/em&gt;” Yes indeed. That’s what I look at when I see a neat new transformation in the literature – what did it work on? Basic amines OK? Tertiary or secondary? Secondary amides tolerated? Carboxylic acids? Free OH groups? I’m disappointed sometimes when I find that a reaction can’t tolerate these, but I’m glad that the papers involved at least went to the trouble of finding the limits to their chemistry. Far worse than that is a paper that tiptoes around the issues of chemical compatibility, leaving you to find out for yourself – if you’re so inclined, and often one is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area identified is late-stage functionalization, C-H bond activation, etc. Those reactions are always welcome, for sure. Chemical diversity is one of the names of the game that we play, and anything that allows us to get more of it quickly and reliably is good news. Blending with the above, the more complex and functionalized the molecules that can be used as substrates for such chemistry, the better. We’ll take fluorination, hydroxylation, amination, addition of methoxy, trifluoromethyl, what have you. It’s great to be able to predict where the functionalization will happen, of course, but there’s value in things that just sort of go in and mess with structures, too: new molecules! After all, that’s what the liver enzymes do to our drugs; we’re used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also calls for new ways to synthesize and functionalize small heterocyclic rings, new metal-catalyzed coupling reactions (and new C-C bond-forming reactions in general), more biomolecule-compatible reactions, and more. It also goes briefly into machine-assisted synthesis and software-assisted retrosynthesis, but the bulk of the paper is on synthetic methods, and I can only cheer on their suggestions. These are all potential areas for academic-industrial collaboration to generate new chemistry, because everyone benefits from success in these areas (indeed, some of this collaboration goes on already for just these reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I enjoyed this paper very much, but it starts off with a claim that’s worth arguing about: “&lt;em&gt;organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects&lt;/em&gt;“. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on where you’re standing. All the synthetic limitations described above are real, and they keep us from being able to make a lot of molecules that we’d otherwise be cranking out. But (and this is a big point) it’s rarely the case that we medicinal chemists identify a tricky new structure that absolutely has to be made. That sounds odd, but it comes down to our predictive powers, which aren’t so great. We don’t generally draw some wild compound up on the hood sash and say “That’s the one, folks: find a way to make it or die trying”. We never know which is the one, so in the absence of knowing, we make the things that we can make in the ways that we can make them, and honestly, much of the time, we can manage to come up with something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, though, things like the ability to make more polar compounds reliably and quickly would probably lead to better and more structurally diverse drug candidates and screening compounds, not to mention better starting points for projects in general. We just don’t know which ones. The main examples of specific compounds I can think of are metabolites or potential metabolites, where the liver has made some new polar compound out of an existing drug candidate, and we need to make the new compound(s) for testing. Those can be tough, and sometimes the only way is to grind out small quantities by exposing the drug to liver tissue itself (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for times we can’t come up with something, I would like to believe that far more diverse and interesting sets of compounds, millions of them, would allow for real hits to be found against target classes that we currently have trouble attacking. But that remains to be proven, if it ever can be. Chemical space is so large that you can always say “Well, your compound set still wasn’t big enough – the good ones are still out there”, and there’s no way to say that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the real killers in drug discovery stem from – to put it mildly – our incomplete understanding of biology. It’s Phase II and Phase III failures that hammer us, and those happen because we don’t understand our desirable (and undesirable) mechanisms of action enough, leading to failures in efficacy and safety. Even worse, they come after a big pile of money has been spent. Compared to these problems, generating chemical matter is not as big a concern. We already generate enough chemical matter to send all sorts of stuff into the clinic, where 80 to 90% of it dies for other reasons entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic chemistry is, of course, crucial to making small-molecule drugs, and you’d think that would be enough. But as a chemist, I wish that organic synthesis were more relevant to these deep problems. But in the big picture, it isn’t quite so. Chemical biology, as a field, is an attempt to make that happen, but How to Make will never be able to answer questions of What to Make and Why.&lt;/p&gt;

Validation of a lung adenocarcinoma specific (LUAD) KRAS-centric PC-Map recapitulated known KRAS biology and, more critically, identified a novel repertoire of proteins eliciting synthetic lethality in KRASG12D LUAD organoid cultures. Showing the generalizable nature of the algorithm, we elucidated PC-Maps for ten recurrently mutated oncoproteins, including KRAS, in distinct tumor contexts. This revealed a highly context-specific nature of cancer&apos;s regulatory and signaling architectures to an unprecedented degree of resolution.</description></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><title>Pisces: An Accurate and Versatile Variant Caller for Somatic and Germline Next-Generation Sequencing Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291641v2?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162783f3c38:7b84542:34f43e70</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/291641</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291641v2?rss=1</originId><published>1522393200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>84a95f1b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291641v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology is transitioning quickly from research labs to clinical settings.

Within the human host, the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; is exposed to multiple selection pressures. The host environment changes dramatically in severe malaria, but the extent to which the parasite responds to—or is selected by—this environment remains unclear. From previous studies, the parasites that cause severe malaria appear to increase expression of a restricted but poorly defined subset of the PfEMP1 variant, surface antigens. PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients. The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. Our RNAseq also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease. These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to—or are selected by—the host environment in severe malaria.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rNZ95HC-F9Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Gerry Q.

Social institutions that facilitate sharing and redistribution may help mitigate the impact of resource shocks. In the North American Arctic, traditional food sharing may direct food to those who need it and provide a form of natural insurance against temporal variability in hunting returns within households. Here, network properties that facilitate resource flow (network size, quality, and density) are examined in a country food sharing network comprising 109 Inuit households from a village in Nunavik (Canada), using regressions to investigate the relationships between these network measures and household socioeconomic attributes. The results show that although single women and elders have larger networks, the sharing network is not structured to prioritize sharing towards households with low food availability. Rather, much food sharing appears to be driven by reciprocity between high-harvest households, meaning that poor, low-harvest households tend to have less sharing-based social capital than more affluent, high-harvest households. This suggests that poor, low-harvest households may be more vulnerable to disruptions in the availability of country food.</content></content><author><name>Elspeth Ready</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elspeth Ready&lt;/p&gt;

This suggests that poor, low-harvest households may be more vulnerable to disruptions in the availability of country food.</description></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><title>[ASAP] Stable Metal–Organic Frameworks with Group 4 Metals: Current Status and Trends</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00073</link><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_16263f869b6:14a6c2:a077e55f</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00073/20180326/images/medium/oc-2018-000738_0006.gif</url><width>498</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>500</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00073</originId><crawled>1522095647158</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId></origin><fingerprint>85dc14dd</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00073/20180326/images/medium/oc-2018-000738_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00073&lt;/div&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00073</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Shuai Yuan, Jun-Sheng Qin, Christina T.

In this paper, explicit Model Predictive Control(MPC) is employed for automated lane-keeping systems. MPC has been regarded as the key to handle such constrained systems. However, the massive computational complexity of MPC, which employs online optimization, has been a major drawback that limits the range of its target application to relatively small and/or slow problems. Explicit MPC can reduce this computational burden using a multi-parametric quadratic programming technique(mp-QP). The control objective is to derive an optimal front steering wheel angle at each sampling time so that autonomous vehicles travel along desired paths, including straight, circular, and clothoid parts, at high entry speeds. In terms of the design of the proposed controller, a method of choosing weighting matrices in an optimization problem and the range of horizons for path-following control are described through simulations. For the verification of the proposed controller, simulation results obtained using other control methods such as MPC, Linear-Quadratic Regulator(LQR), and driver model are employed, and CarSim, which reflects the features of a vehicle more realistically than MATLAB/Simulink, is used for reliable demonstration.</content></content><author><name>Junho Lee</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junho Lee, Hyuk-Jun Chang&lt;/p&gt;

However, the underlying mechanism to ensure such a configuration is unknown. Here we provide evidence that pericentromeric satellite DNA, which is often regarded as junk, is a critical constituent of the chromosome, allowing the packaging of all chromosomes into a single nucleus. We show that the multi AT-hook satellite DNA binding proteins, &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; D1 and mouse HMGA1, play an evolutionarily conserved role in bundling pericentromeric satellite DNA from heterologous chromosomes into &apos;chromocenters&apos;, a cytological association of pericentromeric heterochromatin. Defective chromocenter formation leads to micronuclei formation due to budding from the interphase nucleus, DNA damage and cell death. We propose that chromocenter and satellite DNA serves a fundamental role in encapsulating the full complement of the genome within a single nucleus, the universal characteristic of eukaryotic cells.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34122</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>yukikomy@umich.edu (Madhav Jagannathan)</name></author><published>1522022400000</published><description>A universal and unquestioned characteristic of eukaryotic cells is that the genome is divided into multiple chromosomes and encapsulated in a single nucleus.
