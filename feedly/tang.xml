Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 72.71% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 86.64%, indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq (pred) is 67.45%, which is not very high, indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 73.32% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 79.49%, indicating that 79.49% of the response variability can be explained by the model. Using the optimization software MODE Frontier (Optimization, MOGA-II, 2014), four types of response surfaces for the three considered response variables were tested for the data of DOE. The parameter values obtained using the proposed experimental design methodology result in better graphics quality, and other necessary design attributes.</content></content><author><name>Mustufa Haider Abidi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mustufa Haider Abidi, Abdulrahman Al-Ahmari, Ali Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

Although numerous studies have investigated the neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately each other, it is unclear whether an association between neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity is present. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional changes in hippocampus before and after treatment with escitalopram and to associate these changes with peptides related to neuronal growth in patients with chronic PTSD and trauma survivors without PTSD. Fifteen earthquake survivors with chronic PTSD and thirteen drug naïve trauma exposed individuals without PTSD underwent fMRI scans in a block design. Serum levels of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) were measured before and after 12 weeks treatment with escitalopram. Baseline median serum level of NGF was significantly lower in patients with chronic PTSD than trauma survivors; however, 12 weeks of treatment with escitalopram significantly increased it. Higher activation was found both in left and right hippocampus for chronic PTSD group than trauma survivors. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with suppression of the hyperactivation in left hippocampus in patients with chronic PTSD. Bilateral hyperactivation in hippocampus and lowered NGF may associate with neurobiological disarrangements in chronic PTSD. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with both improvement in the severity of PTSD symptoms and biological alterations. Patients diagnosed with PTSD may have further and complicated deteriorations in hippocampal networks and neurotransmitter systems than individuals who had not been diagnosed with PTSD following the same traumatic experience.</content></content><author><name>Ümit Tural</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ümit Tural, Ahmet Tamer Aker, Emin Önder, Hatice Turan Sodan, Hatice Ünver, Gür Akansel&lt;/p&gt;

Muscle wasting occurs during various chronic diseases and precedes death in humans as in mice. The evaluation of the degree of muscle atrophy in diseased mouse models is often overlooked since it requires the sacrifice of the animals for muscle examination or expensive instrumentation and highly qualified personnel, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Very often behavioral tests for muscle strength evaluation are used as an outcome measurement in preclinical therapeutic trials. However, these tests are easy to perform serially, but not enough sensitive to detect early muscle changes during disease progression. Monitoring muscle loss in living animals could allow to perform more informative preclinical trials with a better evaluation of therapeutic benefit with respect to muscle wasting. We developed a non-invasive procedure based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) without contrast agents to monitor hind limb muscle wasting in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cancer cachexia: the transgenic SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse and the colon adenocarcinoma C26-bearing mouse, respectively. We established the scanning procedure and the parameters to consider in the reconstructed images to calculate the Index of Muscle Mass (IMM).

Muscle wasting occurs during various chronic diseases and precedes death in humans as in mice. The evaluation of the degree of muscle atrophy in diseased mouse models is often overlooked since it requires the sacrifice of the animals for muscle examination or expensive instrumentation and highly qualified personnel, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Very often behavioral tests for muscle strength evaluation are used as an outcome measurement in preclinical therapeutic trials. However, these tests are easy to perform serially, but not enough sensitive to detect early muscle changes during disease progression. Monitoring muscle loss in living animals could allow to perform more informative preclinical trials with a better evaluation of therapeutic benefit with respect to muscle wasting. We developed a non-invasive procedure based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) without contrast agents to monitor hind limb muscle wasting in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cancer cachexia: the transgenic SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse and the colon adenocarcinoma C26-bearing mouse, respectively. We established the scanning procedure and the parameters to consider in the reconstructed images to calculate the Index of Muscle Mass (IMM). The coefficient of variance for the whole procedure was 2.2%. We performed longitudinally micro-CT scan of hind limbs in SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice at presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of the disease and calculated the IMM. We found that IMM in SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice was lower than age-matched controls even before symptom onset. We also detected a further decrease in IMM as disease progresses, most markedly just before disease onset.

It is unclear how systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) controls local inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of human MSCs on inflammatory arthritis and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Mice with collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) received two intraperitoneal injections of human bone marrow-derived MSCs. The clinical and histological features of injected CAIA were then compared with those of non-injected mice. The effect of MSCs on induction of regulatory T cells was examined both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We also examined multiple cytokines secreted by peritoneal mononuclear cells, along with migration of MSCs in the presence of stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α) and/or regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Sections of CAIA mouse joints and spleen were stained for human anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) to confirm migration of injected human MSCs. The results showed that MSCs alleviated the clinical and histological signs of synovitis in CAIA mice. Peritoneal lavage cells from mice treated with MSCs expressed higher levels of SDF-1α and RANTES than those from mice not treated with MSCs. MSC migration was more prevalent in the presence of SDF-1α and/or RANTES. MSCs induced CD4+ T cells to differentiate into regulatory T cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and expression of FOXP3 mRNA was upregulated in the forepaws of MSC-treated CAIA mice. Synovial and splenic tissues from CAIA mice receiving human MSCs were positive for human ANA, suggesting recruitment of MSCs. Taken together, these results suggest that MSCs migrate into inflamed tissues and directly induce the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells, which then suppress inflammation.

This study aimed to compare the significance of LAP in predicting hypertension risk with other obesity indices, and to evaluate the interactive effects of LAP and smoking, family history of hypertension on hypertension risk in Chinese Han adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A community based cross-sectional study was performed in Bengbu, China. Participants received face-to-face questionnaire survey, anthropometric tests and laboratory examinations. Relevant indicators that reflect obesity including BMI (body mass index), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and LAP were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the association between LAP and hypertension risk. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC) of LAP, BMI, and WHtR were calculated and then compared. Interactive effect was evaluated by relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP) and synergy index (SI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1777 participants were enrolled, and the prevalence of hypertension was 24.4% (n = 433). There was a significant increase in hypertension risk with LAP levels in the fourth quartile as compared with the bottom quartile (OR: 3.31, 95%CI: 1.76–6.25). The AUC of LAP was significantly different than that of BMI in males (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; = 2.158, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0309) and females (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; = 3.570, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0004), while only performed better in females as compared with that of WHtR (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; = 2.166, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0303).

This time difference reflects both the rarity of the event require to drive acidity and the extreme nature of some of the fluctuations.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Is_Lewis_Acidity_in_Metal_Dications_Triggered_by_Solvent_Shell_Fluctuations_/6303710</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527082862866</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1638d3b4912:75f58ac:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4881.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Michal Bauer, Jana Cahlikova, Julie Chytilova, Tomaš Želinsky</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4881</canonicalUrl><engagement>43</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4881.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><title>Social contagion of ethnic hostility [Economic Sciences]</title><fingerprint>da497f86</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Interethnic conflicts often escalate rapidly.

Purkinje neuron dendritic degeneration precedes cell loss in cerebellar ataxia, but the basis for dendritic vulnerability in ataxia remains poorly understood. Recent work has suggested that potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel dysfunction and consequent spiking abnormalities contribute to Purkinje neuron degeneration, but little attention has been paid to how K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel dysfunction impacts dendritic excitability and the role this may play in the degenerative process. We examined the relationship between K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel dysfunction, dendritic excitability and dendritic degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Examination of published RNA sequencing data from SCA1 mice revealed reduced expression of several K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that are important regulators of excitability in Purkinje neuron dendrites. Patch clamp recordings in Purkinje neurons from SCA1 mice identified increased dendritic excitability in the form of enhanced back-propagation of action potentials and an increased propensity to produce dendritic calcium spikes. Dendritic excitability could be rescued by restoring expression of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels and activating other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels with baclofen. Importantly, this treatment combination improves motor performance and mitigates dendritic degeneration in SCA1 mice. These results suggest that reduced expression of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels results in persistently increased dendritic excitability at all stages of disease in SCA1, which in turn may contribute to the dendritic degeneration that precedes cell loss.</content></content><author><name>Ravi Chopra</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ravi Chopra, David D.

We expect the resolution of these questions to facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a knowledge-oriented approach.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325423v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526590416464</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636fe12650:4cbe00a:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-e?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527183688000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/870.5.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-e?rss=1</link><title>Using bugs in the gut to detect blood</title><fingerprint>e5fcb13</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce94e:3dd877af</id><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-e?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Engineering, Molecular Biology</item></keywords><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025058?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Neil Raymond</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025058?af=R</link><title>A path integral methodology for obtaining thermodynamic properties of nonadiabatic systems using Gaussian mixture distributions</title><fingerprint>19355142</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/19&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 19&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1526620929000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025058?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526887776990</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163819a82de:61571e4:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Synthesis_of_a_Novel_Bicyclic_Scaffold_Inspired_by_the_Antifungal_Natural_Product_Sordarin/6394409</originId><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Synthesis_of_a_Novel_Bicyclic_Scaffold_Inspired_by_the_Antifungal_Natural_Product_Sordarin/6394409</link><title>Synthesis of a Novel Bicyclic Scaffold Inspired by the Antifungal Natural Product Sordarin</title><fingerprint>92bd8393</fingerprint><description>A simplified bicyclic scaffold inspired by the antifungal natural product sordarin was designed and synthesized which maintains the carboxylic acid/aldehyde (or nitrile) pharmacophore.

Background &lt;p&gt;Stillbirth rates remain high in many low-income settings, with fresh (intrapartum) stillbirths accounting for a large part due to limited obstetrical care. We aimed to determine the stillbirth rate and identify potentially modifiable factors associated with stillbirth in urban Guinea-Bissau.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was carried out by the Bandim Health Project (BHP), a Health and Demographic Surveillance System site in the capital Bissau. We assessed stillbirth rates in a hospital cohort consisting of all deliveries at the maternity ward at the National Hospital Simão Mendes (HNSM), and in a community cohort, which only included women from the BHP area. Stillbirth was classified as fresh (FSB) if fetal movements were reported on the day of delivery.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From October 1 2007 to April 15 2013, a total of 38164 deliveries were registered at HNSM, among them 3762 stillbirths (99/1000 births). Excluding deliveries referred to the hospital from outside the capital (9.6%), the HNSM stillbirth rate was 2786/34490 births (81/1000). During the same period, 15462 deliveries were recorded in the community cohort. Of these, 768 were stillbirths (50/1000).Of 11769 hospital deliveries among women from Bissau with data on fetal movement, 866 (74/1000) were stillbirths, and 609 (70.3%) of these were FSB, i.e. potentially preventable. The hospital FSB rate was highest in the evening from 4 pm to midnight (P = 0.04). In the community cohort, antenatal care (ANC) attendance correlated strongly with stillbirth reduction; the stillbirth rate was 71/1000 if the mother attended no ANC consultations vs. 36/1000 if she attended ≥7 consultations (P&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In Bissau, the stillbirth rate is alarmingly high. The majority of stillbirths are preventable FSB. Improving obstetrical training, labour management (including sufficient intrapartum monitoring and timely intervention) and hospital infrastructure is urgently required. This should be combined with proper community strategies and additional focus on antenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Morten Bjerregaard-Andersen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Morten Bjerregaard-Andersen, Najaaraq Lund, Anne Sofie Pinstrup Joergensen, Frida Starup Jepsen, Holger Werner Unger, Mama Mane, Amabelia Rodrigues, Staffan Bergström, Christine Stabell Benn&lt;/p&gt;

Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment promotes glioma progression. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans appear in the ECM and on the cell surface, and can be catalyzed by dermatan sulfate epimerase to form chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) hybrid chains. Dermatan sulfate epimerase 1 (DSE) is overexpressed in many types of cancer, and CS/DS chains mediate several growth factor signals. However, the role of DSE in gliomas has never been explored. In the present study, we determined the expression of DSE in gliomas by consulting a public database and conducting immunohistochemistry on a tissue array. Our investigation revealed that DSE was upregulated in gliomas compared with normal brain tissue. Furthermore, high DSE expression was associated with advanced tumor grade and poor survival. We found high DSE expression in several glioblastoma cell lines, and DSE expression directly mediated DS chain formation in glioblastoma cells. Knockdown of DSE suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioblastoma cells. In contrast, overexpression of DSE in GL261 cells enhanced these malignant phenotypes and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tumor growth. Interestingly, we found that DSE selectively regulated heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)-induced signaling in glioblastoma cells. Inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 with afatinib suppressed DSE-enhanced malignant phenotypes, establishing the critical role of the ErbB pathway in regulating the effects of DSE expression. This evidence indicates that upregulation of DSE in gliomas contributes to malignant behavior in cancer cells. We provide novel insight into the significance of DS chains in ErbB signaling and glioma pathogenesis.</content></content><author><name>Wen-Chieh Liao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Chieh Liao, Chih-Kai Liao, You-Huan Tsai, To-Jung Tseng, Li-Ching Chuang, Chyn-Tair Lan, Hung-Ming Chang, Chiung-Hui Liu&lt;/p&gt;

We need all the reality checks we can get, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/423&quot;&gt;and this one&lt;/a&gt; (reported by a large multinational team led out of Oxford) uses light scattering to get more mass resolution than I would have thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light scattering by small particles depends on their refractive index and the particle volume. Proteins have basically the same refractive index (the indices of the individual amino acids don’t vary that much, and it’s all averaged out). Likewise, the volume occupied by each amino acid is very similar as well, and putting these together means that if you do very accurate light scattering measurements (using interferometry) the signal you get should be proportional to the number of amino acid residues or the total mass. This effect has been predicted, but recent improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to actually observe this and use it in real applications. The group gives the technique the deliberately memorable name of iSCAMS (interferometric scattering mass spectrometry), and we’ll have to get used to the idea of being able to do “mass spec” with a microscope and visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over a range of proteins (both monomers and larger oligomers), the team found a very good correlation (within 1.8%, plus or minus half a per cent) between the interferomic signature and protein mass, one that (importantly) was not influenced by the three-dimensional shape of the protein itself. The correlation also held for lipid nanodisc species, which is a good sign. And since I was writing just the other day about glycosylated proteins, I note that they also observed various states of a highly glycosylated (up to half the molecular weight) HIV envelope complex, and could spot the differences there as well. So it look like the effect holds for a number of different biomolecule types, although I expect that there will be refinements to the scattering models for these as the technique is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like it could be a very good technique for studying protein-protein interactions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the potential advantage of spatial resolution as well. I’m not sure if you could ever get something like this to work in a living cell (the signal/noise would be a huge problem), but there’s a lot of biomolecular behavior that you could get new details on short of that. There are a lot of variations to try, such as different surfaces, and immobilized binding partners. This could be a good complement to techniques like SPR, only this time at a single-protein level. It’ll be interesting to see if it can get to the point of delivering on- and off-rates, which is one of SPR’s great advantages. As it stands now, the resolution of iSCAMS doesn’t seem good enough to detect small-molecule binding to individual proteins, but it could certainly pick up small molecule effects on protein complexes, and presumably effects on protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-polysaccharide interactions as well. That should keep everyone occupied!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1525957661000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I’m always happy when a new analytical technique is worked out, especially one that’s applicable to biological binding assays, doesn’t require labeling of the species involved, and is orthogonal to the existing methods.

metal oxides often proceeds through non-equilibrium phases, whose appearance
cannot be anticipated from traditional phase diagrams. Without a precise
understanding of which metastable phases form, or their lifetimes, targeted
synthesis of specific metal oxides can become a trial-and-error process. Here, we derive a new thermodynamic potential for the
free-energy of a metal oxide in water, which reveals a hidden metastable energy
landscape above the equilibrium Pourbaix diagram. By combining this ‘Pourbaix
potential’ with classical nucleation theory, we interrogate how solution
conditions can influence the multistage oxidation pathways of manganese oxides.
We calculate that even within the same phase stability region of a Pourbaix
diagram, subtle variations in pH and
redox potential can redirect a crystallization pathway through different
metastable phases. Our theoretical framework offers a predictive platform to navigate
through the thermodynamic and kinetic energy landscape towards the rational
synthesis of target metal oxide phases.</description><published>1526947200000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Aqueous precipitation of transition
metal oxides often proceeds through non-equilibrium phases, whose appearance
cannot be anticipated from traditional phase diagrams. Without a precise
understanding of which metastable phases form, or their lifetimes, targeted
synthesis of specific metal oxides can become a trial-and-error process. Here, we derive a new thermodynamic potential for the
free-energy of a metal oxide in water, which reveals a hidden metastable energy
landscape above the equilibrium Pourbaix diagram. By combining this ‘Pourbaix
potential’ with classical nucleation theory, we interrogate how solution
conditions can influence the multistage oxidation pathways of manganese oxides.
We calculate that even within the same phase stability region of a Pourbaix
diagram, subtle variations in pH and
redox potential can redirect a crystallization pathway through different
metastable phases. Our theoretical framework offers a predictive platform to navigate
through the thermodynamic and kinetic energy landscape towards the rational
synthesis of target metal oxide phases.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Non-Equilibrium_Crystallization_Pathways_of_Manganese_Oxides_in_Aqueous_Solution/6300959</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526997927196</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163882b451c:6b7faf8:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Polymorphism_of_Bulk_Boron_Nitride/6388637</originId><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Polymorphism_of_Bulk_Boron_Nitride/6388637</link><title>Polymorphism of Bulk Boron Nitride</title><fingerprint>9db676</fingerprint><description>Boron nitride (BN) is a material with outstanding technological promise because of its exceptional thermochemical stability, structural, electronic and thermal conductivity properties, and extreme hardness.

Immediately following a fracture, a fibrin laden hematoma is formed to prevent bleeding and infection. Subsequently, the organized removal of fibrin, via the protease plasmin, is essential to permit fracture repair through angiogenesis and ossification. Yet, when plasmin activity is lost, the depletion of fibrin alone is insufficient to fully restore fracture repair, suggesting the existence of additional plasmin targets important for fracture repair. Previously, activated matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was demonstrated to function in fracture repair by promoting angiogenesis. Given that MMP-9 is a defined plasmin target, it was hypothesized that pro-MMP-9, following plasmin activation, promotes fracture repair. This hypothesis was tested in a fixed murine femur fracture model with serial assessment of fracture healing. Contrary to previous findings, a complete loss of MMP-9 failed to affect fracture healing and union through 28 days post injury. Therefore, these results demonstrated that MMP-9 is dispensable for timely fracture union and cartilage transition to bone in fixed femur fractures. Pro-MMP-9 is therefore not a significant target of plasmin in fracture repair and future studies assessing additional plasmin targets associated with angiogenesis are warranted.</content></content><author><name>Masato Yuasa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masato Yuasa, Masanori Saito, Cesar Molina, Stephanie N.

Consumption of different PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) can induce functional changes in blood vessels via endothelial cells, which interact with dietary factors in the circulation. The basement membrane that separates the endothelium from the smooth muscle cells of the medial layer can also influence the functional state of endothelial cells. However, the effect of basement membrane on the endothelial response to dietary PUFAs in relation to growth state (e.g. proliferation versus quiescence) has never been investigated. We therefore compared the viability (CCK kit) and proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) of EA.hy926 endothelial cells grown on Matrigel or collagen versus non-coated plates. EA.hy926 viability and proliferation were also assessed after treatment with 0–150 μM of PUFAs [linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. Our study showed that only cells grown on Matrigel-coated plates reached quiescence after becoming confluent with a decreased level of MCM2 and p-cyclin D1 (T286), increased levels of p27kip1 and a low level of apoptosis and senescence. AA, EPA and DHA decreased the viability and proliferation of subconfluent cells grown on plastic dishes in a dose-dependent manner, while the presence of Matrigel made the cells resistant to these adverse effects. Confluent cell viability was less sensitive to higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA than subconfluent cells, and a significant increase in caspase-3 cleavage was only observed in confluent cells treated with DHA. Higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA suppressed DNA synthesis by both subconfluent and confluent cells, while precursor C18 PUFAs (LA and ALA) had no negative effects on viability and proliferation. Our study is the first to show that extracellular matrix and growth state are important factors in the EA.hy926 cell response to PUFAs, and that the mechanisms by which individual PUFAs operate may be growth state-dependent.</content></content><author><name>Youjia Du</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youjia Du, Carla G.

AA, EPA and DHA decreased the viability and proliferation of subconfluent cells grown on plastic dishes in a dose-dependent manner, while the presence of Matrigel made the cells resistant to these adverse effects. Confluent cell viability was less sensitive to higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA than subconfluent cells, and a significant increase in caspase-3 cleavage was only observed in confluent cells treated with DHA. Higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA suppressed DNA synthesis by both subconfluent and confluent cells, while precursor C18 PUFAs (LA and ALA) had no negative effects on viability and proliferation. Our study is the first to show that extracellular matrix and growth state are important factors in the EA.hy926 cell response to PUFAs, and that the mechanisms by which individual PUFAs operate may be growth state-dependent.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197613</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b92:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25808-8</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS) were introduced to overcome some of the limitations of drug-eluting stent (DES) for PCI. Data regarding the clinical outcomes of the BVS versus DES beyond 2 years are emerging.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study mid-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched online databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, CENTRAL), several websites, meeting presentations and scientific session abstracts until August 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2017 for studies comparing Absorb BVS with second-generation DES. The primary outcome was target lesion failure (TLF). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and definite/probable device thrombosis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using a random effects model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten studies, seven randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies, with a total of 7320 patients (BVS n = 4007; DES n = 3313) and a median follow-up duration of 30.5 months, were included. Risk of TLF was increased for BVS-treated patients (OR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.12–1.60], p = 0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). This was also the case for all myocardial infarction (1.58 [95% CI: 1.27–1.96], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), TLR (1.48 [95% CI: 1.19–1.85], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%) and definite/probable device thrombosis (of 2.82 (95% CI: 1.86–3.89], p&amp;lt;0.001 and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 40.3%). This did not result in a difference in all-cause mortality (0.78 [95% CI: 0.58–1.04], p = 0.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). OR for very late (&gt;1 year) device thrombosis was 6.10 [95% CI: 1.40–26.65], p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;At mid-term follow-up, BVS was associated with an increased risk of TLF, MI, TLR and definite/probable device thrombosis, but this did not result in an increased risk of all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Cordula M.

Kidney immune cells play important roles in pathogenesis of many diseases, including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and transplant rejection. While studying murine kidney T cells, we serendipitously identified a kidney mononuclear phagocytic cell (MPC) subset characterized by intermediate surface expression of CD45 and CD11b. These CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPCs were further identified as F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cells, comprising ~17% of total CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in normal mouse kidney (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and virtually absent from all other organs examined except the heart. Systemic clodronate treatment had more significant depletive effect on the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; population (77.3%±5.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) than on CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population (14.8%±16.6%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.49). In addition, CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPCs had higher phagocytic function in the normal kidney (35.6%±3.3% vs. 24.1%±2.2%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04), but lower phagocytic capacity in post-ischemic kidney (54.9%±1.0% vs. 67.8%±1.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) compared to the CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population. Moreover, the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; population had higher intracellular production of the pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (58.4%±5.2% vs. 27.3%±0.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and lower production of the anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 (7.2%±1.3% vs. 14.9%±2.2%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) following kidney IRI, suggesting a functional role under inflammatory conditions. The CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; cells increased early after IRI, and then abruptly decreased 48h later, whereas CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells steadily increased after IRI before declining at 72h (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). We also identified the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPC subtype in human kidney. We conclude that CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;population represent a unique subset of MPCs found in both mouse and human kidneys.

We conclude that CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;population represent a unique subset of MPCs found in both mouse and human kidneys. Future studies will further characterize their role in kidney health and disease.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198608</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527876013672</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bfb:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26627-7</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Sang Hyun Park</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26627-7</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26627-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Alcohol use effects on adolescent brain development revealed by simultaneously removing confounding factors, identifying morphometric patterns, and classifying individuals</title><fingerprint>fe409e09</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alcohol use effects on adolescent brain development revealed by simultaneously removing confounding factors, identifying morphometric patterns, and classifying individuals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use effects on adolescent brain development revealed by simultaneously removing confounding factors, identifying morphometric patterns, and classifying individuals, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26627-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26627-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Alcohol use effects on adolescent brain development revealed by simultaneously removing confounding factors, identifying morphometric patterns, and classifying individuals&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/BVse-ov9-r4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1527577200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alcohol use effects on adolescent brain development revealed by simultaneously removing confounding factors, identifying morphometric patterns, and classifying individuals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use effects on adolescent brain development revealed by simultaneously removing confounding factors, identifying morphometric patterns, and classifying individuals, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26627-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26627-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Alcohol use effects on adolescent brain development revealed by simultaneously removing confounding factors, identifying morphometric patterns, and classifying individuals&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/BVse-ov9-r4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/BVse-ov9-r4/s41598-018-26627-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527585698214</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163ab33f1a6:1d6388b:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Probing_the_Mechanochemistry_of_Metal-Organic_Frameworks_with_Low-Frequency_Vibrational_Spectroscopy/6244892</originId><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Probing_the_Mechanochemistry_of_Metal-Organic_Frameworks_with_Low-Frequency_Vibrational_Spectroscopy/6244892</link><title>Probing the Mechanochemistry of Metal-Organic Frameworks with Low-Frequency Vibrational Spectroscopy</title><fingerprint>3d3499dd</fingerprint><description>The identification of low-frequency vibrational motions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) allows for a full understanding of their mechanical and structural response upon perturbation by external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, and adsorption.

Self-measurement and documentation of blood-glucose are critical elements of diabetes management, particularly in regimes including insulin. In this study, we analyze the usability of iBG-STAR, the first blood glucose meter connectable to a smartphone. This technology records glucometer measurements, removing the burden of documentation from diabetic patients. This study assesses the potential for implementation of iBG-STAR in routine care. Twelve long-term diabetic patients (4 males; median age of 66.5 years) were enrolled in the study. N = 4/12 reported diabetic polyneuropathy. Reported subjective mental workload for all tasks related to iBG-STAR was on average lower than 12 points, corresponding to the verbal code ‘nearly no effort needed’. A “Post Study System Usability Questionnaire”, evaluated the glucometer at an average value of 2.06 (SD = 1.02) on a 7-Likert-scale (1 = ‘I fully agree’ to 7 = ‘I completely disagree’) for usability. These results represent a positive user-experience. Patients with polyneuropathy may experience physical difficulties in completing the tasks, thereby affecting usability. Technologically savvy patients (n = 6) with a positive outlook on diabetes assessed the product as a suitable tool for themselves and would recommend to other diabetic patients. The main barrier to regular use was treating physicians’ inability to retrieve digitally recorded data. This barrier was due to a shortcoming in interoperability of mobile devices and medical information systems.</content></content><author><name>Peter Rasche</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Rasche, Alexander Mertens, Talya Miron-Shatz, Corinne Berzon, Christopher M.

The immortal strand hypothesis poses that stem cells could produce differentiated progeny while conserving the original template strand, thus avoiding accumulating somatic mutations. However, quantitating the extent of non-random DNA strand segregation in human stem cells remains difficult &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that the change of the mean and variance of the mutational burden with age in healthy human tissues allows estimating strand segregation probabilities and somatic mutation rates. We analysed deep sequencing data from healthy human colon, small intestine, liver, skin and brain. We found highly effective non-random DNA strand segregation in all adult tissues (mean strand segregation probability: 0.98, standard error bounds (0.97,0.99)). In contrast, non-random strand segregation efficiency is reduced to 0.87 (0.78,0.88) in neural tissue during early development, suggesting stem cell pool expansions due to symmetric self-renewal. Healthy somatic mutation rates differed across tissue types, ranging from 3.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;/bp/division in small intestine to 1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;/bp/division in skin.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JlwnjY5R61I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1528404128581</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Werner, Andrea Sottoriva&lt;/p&gt;

This retrospective study describes the biological and epidemiological aspects, gross and microscopical findings, and most likely causes of death (CD) in two species of Neotropical deer in Brazil. The animals were collected between 1995 and 2015 and represented 75 marsh deer (MD) and 136 brown brocket deer (BBD). Summarized, pneumonia was diagnosed microscopically in 48 MD and 52 BBD; 76 deer suffered trauma, involving dog attack (14 BBD) and vehicle-collision (14 BBD). Pulmonary edema (50 MD; 55 BBD) and congestion (57 MD; 78 BBD) were the most common findings for both species. Additionally, we diagnosed ruminal and myocardial mycosis in MD and BBD, respectively; ovarian dysgerminoma and pancreatic trematodiasis in BBD; and lesions suggestive of malignant catarrhal fever and orbiviral hemorrhagic disease in both species. The main CD in MD was: respiratory (41/75), alimentary, nutritional, trauma and euthanasia (3/75 each). Correspondingly, in BBD were: trauma (34/131), respiratory (30/131) and euthanasia (9/131). Respiratory disease was often defined by pulmonary edema and pneumonia. We provide evidence that respiratory disease, mainly pneumonia, is a critical pathological process in these Neotropical deer species. Although no etiological agents were identified, there is evidence of bacterial and viral involvement. Our results show trauma, mainly anthropogenic, as a common ailment in BBD. We propose to prioritize respiratory disease in future research focused on South American deer health aspects. We believe anthropogenic trauma may be a primary threat for populations of BBD.</content></content><author><name>Pedro Enrique Navas-Suárez</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pedro Enrique Navas-Suárez, Josué Díaz-Delgado, Eliana Reiko Matushima, Cintia Maria Fávero, Angélica Maria Sánchez Sarmiento, Carlos Sacristán, Ana Carolina Ewbank, Adriana Marques Joppert, Jose Mauricio Barbanti Duarte, Cinthya dos Santos-Cirqueira, Bruno Cogliati, Leonardo Mesquita, Paulo César Maiorka, José Luiz Catão-Dias&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, second only to respiratory tract infections and particularly prevalent within primary care. Conventional detection of UTIs is culture, however, return of results can take between 24 and 72 hours. The introduction of a point of care (POC) test would allow for more timely identification of UTIs, facilitating improved, targeted treatment. This study aimed to obtain consensus on the criteria required for a POC UTI test, to meet patient need within primary care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Criteria for consideration were compiled by the research team. These criteria were validated through a two-round Delphi process, utilising an expert panel of healthcare professionals from across Europe and United States of America. Using web-based questionnaires, panellists recorded their level of agreement with each criterion based on a 5-point Likert Scale, with space for comments. Using median response, interquartile range and comments provided, criteria were accepted/rejected/revised depending on pre-agreed cut-off scores.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The first round questionnaire presented thirty-three criteria to the panel, of which 22 were accepted. Consensus was not achieved for the remaining 11 criteria. Following response review, one criterion was removed, while after revision, the remaining 10 criteria entered the second round. Of these, four were subsequently accepted, resulting in 26 criteria considered appropriate for a POC test to detect urinary infections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study generated an approved set of criteria for a POC test to detect urinary infections. Criteria acceptance and comments provided by the healthcare professionals also supports the development of a multiplex point of care UTI test.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nichola-Jane M.

Consensus was not achieved for the remaining 11 criteria. Following response review, one criterion was removed, while after revision, the remaining 10 criteria entered the second round. Of these, four were subsequently accepted, resulting in 26 criteria considered appropriate for a POC test to detect urinary infections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study generated an approved set of criteria for a POC test to detect urinary infections. Criteria acceptance and comments provided by the healthcare professionals also supports the development of a multiplex point of care UTI test.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198595</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:6683351:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00080</originId><origin><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId></origin><published>1526616000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00080</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00080</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] A Symmetric Molecule Produced by Mycobacteria Generates Cell-Length Asymmetry during Cell-Division and Thereby Cell-Length Heterogeneity</title><fingerprint>438cd8de</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00080/20180518/images/medium/cb-2018-00080q_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00080&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Mucositis is a side effect of chemotherapy seen in the digestive tract, with symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, inflammation and ulcerations. Our aim was to investigate whether endogenous glucagon-like peptide -1 and -2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2) are implicated in intestinal healing after chemotherapy-induced mucositis.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We used a transgenic mouse model Tg(GCG.DTR)(Tg) expressing the human diphtheria toxin receptor in the proglucagon-producing cells. Injections with diphtheria toxin ablated the GLP-1 and GLP-2 producing L-cells in Tg mice with no effect in wild-type (WT) mice. Mice were injected with 5-fluorouracil or saline and received vehicle, exendin-4, teduglutide (gly2-GLP-2), or exendin-4/teduglutide in combination. The endpoints were body weight change, small intestinal weight, morphology, histological scoring of mucositis and myeloperoxidase levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ablation of L-cells led to impaired GLP-2 secretion; increased loss of body weight; lower small intestinal weight; lower crypt depth, villus height and mucosal area; and increased the mucositis severity score in mice given 5-fluorouracil. WT mice showed compensatory hyperproliferation as a sign of regeneration in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide rescued the body weight of the Tg mice and led to a hyperproliferation in the small intestine, whereas single treatment was less effective.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The ablation of L-cells leads to severe mucositis and insufficient intestinal healing, shown by severe body weight loss and lack of compensatory hyperproliferation in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide could prevent this. Because both peptides were needed, we can conclude that both GLP-1 and GLP-2 are essential for intestinal healing in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Rasmus Hytting-Andreasen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rasmus Hytting-Andreasen, Emilie Balk-Møller, Bolette Hartmann, Jens Pedersen, Johanne Agerlin Windeløv, Jens Juul Holst, Hannelouise Kissow&lt;/p&gt;

General practice has an important role within the Australian healthcare system to provide access to care and effective management of chronic health conditions. However, people with serious mental illness experience challenges associated with service access. The current paper seeks to examine drivers of access to general practice for people with common and serious mental disorders, compared with people who access care for type II diabetes, a common physical health problem managed in general practice. The Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) programme provides the most comprehensive and objective measurement of general practitioner activity in Australia. Using BEACH data, this study compared general practice encounters for depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and type II diabetes during a 10-year period between 2006 and 2016. Analysis revealed more frequent encounters for depression compared to anxiety, and a higher representation of women in encounters for bipolar disorder compared to men. The relationship between number of encounters and patient age was strongly associated with the life course and mortality characteristics associated with each disorder. The findings highlight specific challenges associated with access to primary care for people with serious mental illness, and suggest areas of focus to improve the ability of these patients to access and navigate the health system.</content></content><author><name>Louise M.

The findings highlight specific challenges associated with access to primary care for people with serious mental illness, and suggest areas of focus to improve the ability of these patients to access and navigate the health system.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198400</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8454f:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/E5279.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Minji Lee, Jong Hyun Kim, Ina Yoon, Chulho Lee, Mohammad Fallahi Sichani, Jong Soon Kang, Jeonghyun Kang, Min Guo, Kang Young Lee, Gyoonhee Han, Sunghoon Kim, Jung Min Han</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/E5279</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/E5279.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><title>Coordination of the leucine-sensing Rag GTPase cycle by leucyl-tRNA synthetase in the mTORC1 signaling pathway [Biochemistry]</title><fingerprint>ce902b6e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>A protein synthesis enzyme, leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LRS), serves as a leucine sensor for the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is a central effector for protein synthesis, metabolism, autophagy, and cell growth.

Várzea forests account for 17% of the Amazon basin and endure an annual inundation that can reach 14 m deep during 6–8 months. This flood pulse in combination with topography directly influences the várzea vegetation cover. Assemblages of several taxa differ significantly between unflooded &lt;i&gt;terra firme&lt;/i&gt; and flooded várzea forests, but little is known about the distribution of medium and large sized terrestrial mammals in várzea habitats. Therefore, our goal was to understand how those habitats influence mammalian species distribution during the dry season. Specifically, we: (1) compared the species composition between a terra firme (Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve) and a várzea forest (Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve); and (2) tested the influence of the várzea habitat classes on the number of records, occurrence and species composition of mammalian assemblages. The sampling design in each reserve consisted of 50 baited camera trap stations, with an overall sampling effort of 5015 camera trap days. We used Non-Metric Multidimension Scaling (NMDS) to compare species composition between terra firme and várzea forests, and used Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to assess how habitat types and a habitat diversity index affect mammal distributions. We recorded 21 medium and large sized mammalian species, including 20 species in terra firme and only six in várzea (3443 records). Flood pulse and isolation in várzea forest drove the dissimilarity between these two forest types. In várzea forest, medium size mammals, in general, avoided habitats associated with long flooding periods, while jaguars (&lt;i&gt;Panthera onca&lt;/i&gt;) appeared to prefer aquatic/terrestrial transition zones.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Diffusion Tensor MRI (DT-MRI) is a promising tool for the evaluation of brachial plexus pathology. Therefore, we introduce and evaluate a fast DT-MRI protocol (8min33s scanning with 5–10 min postprocessing time) for the brachial plexus.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Thirty healthy volunteers within three age-groups (18–35, 36–55, and &gt; 56) received DT-MRI of the brachial-plexus twice. Means of fractional-anisotropy (FA), mean-diffusivity (MD), axial-diffusivity (AD), and radial-diffusivity (RD) for the individual roots and trunks were evaluated. A stepwise forward approach was applied to test for correlations with age, sex, body-mass-index (BMI), bodysurface, height, and bodyweight. Within-subject, intra-rater, and inter-rater repeatability were assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, coefficient of variation (CV), intraclass-correlation (ICC), and minimal detectable difference (MDD).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;No differences between sides and root levels were found. MD, AD, and RD correlated (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) with bodyweight. Within-subject quantification proved repeatable with CVs for FA, MD, AD, and RD of 16%, 12%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The DT-MRI protocol was fast and repeatable. Found correlations should be considered in future studies of brachial plexus pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jos Oudeman</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jos Oudeman, Camiel Verhamme, Maurits P.

Therefore, we introduce and evaluate a fast DT-MRI protocol (8min33s scanning with 5–10 min postprocessing time) for the brachial plexus.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Thirty healthy volunteers within three age-groups (18–35, 36–55, and &gt; 56) received DT-MRI of the brachial-plexus twice. Means of fractional-anisotropy (FA), mean-diffusivity (MD), axial-diffusivity (AD), and radial-diffusivity (RD) for the individual roots and trunks were evaluated. A stepwise forward approach was applied to test for correlations with age, sex, body-mass-index (BMI), bodysurface, height, and bodyweight. Within-subject, intra-rater, and inter-rater repeatability were assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, coefficient of variation (CV), intraclass-correlation (ICC), and minimal detectable difference (MDD).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;No differences between sides and root levels were found. MD, AD, and RD correlated (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) with bodyweight. Within-subject quantification proved repeatable with CVs for FA, MD, AD, and RD of 16%, 12%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The DT-MRI protocol was fast and repeatable. Found correlations should be considered in future studies of brachial plexus pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196975</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed9:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25229?af=R</originId><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><author><name>F.

S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</content></content><author><name>De Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by De Chen, Linjie Luo, Chao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Although many previous studies have examined the determinants of happiness in older adults, few have investigated the association between pension types and happiness. When compared to other conventional socioeconomic indicators, pension types may be more indicative of long-term socioeconomic status as they can reflect a person’s job history over their life course.

The study population comprised 120152 participants from 2013. We calculated the prevalence ratios of happiness for the different pension types using Poisson regression models that controlled for age, sex, marital status, equivalent income, wealth, education level, working status, occupation, depression, and social support.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After controlling for socioeconomic indicators, the prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of happiness for no pension benefits, low pension benefits, and moderate pension benefits relative to high pension benefits were 0.77 (0.73–0.81), 0.95 (0.94–0.97), and 0.98 (0.97–0.99), respectively. However, the inclusion of depression as a covariate weakened the association between pension types and happiness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While pension types were associated with happiness after adjusting for other proxy measures of socioeconomic status, the association diminished following adjustment for depression.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In Germany, a 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for elderly (60+) and patients 16+ with chronic diseases not associated with immune suppression. For all other patients at risk, sequential immunization with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) first, followed by PPSV23 is recommended. Repeated vaccination with PPSV23 is recommended every 6 years after individual assessment by the physician. This was adopted into the vaccination directive with binding reimbursement and funding. However, additional voluntary services allow statutory health insurances to differentiate from each other. Aim of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of voluntary service scenarios compared to the strategy in place to support informed decision making.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A microsimulation framework with Markov-type process of a population susceptible to pneumococcal disease over a lifetime horizon was developed to compare effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different vaccination strategies. We simulated 1,000 iterations for seven scenarios. Assumptions were derived from published literature and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was run to show the robustness of the model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our study indicates that all voluntary service strategies could prevent further clinical cases compared to the existing policy. Depending on the scenario, 48–142 invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), 24,000–45,000 hospitalized all-cause nonbacteremic pneumonia (NBP), 15,000–45,000 outpatient NBP cases, and 4,000–8,000 deaths could be avoided on average. This refers to potential savings of €115 Mio. - €187 Mio. for medical and non-medical costs. Additional costs per patient for the payer are €2.48 to €7.13 and for the society €2.20 to €6.85. The ICER per LYG ranged from €3,662 to €23,061 (payer) and €3,258 to €29,617 (societal). All but one scenario was cost-effective in ≥60% of the generated 1,000 simulations.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Compared to the vaccination strategy in place, the different hypothetical scenarios can be considered cost-effective and suitable as additional voluntary services.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Ulrike Kuchenbecker</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ulrike Kuchenbecker, Daniela Chase, Anika Reichert, Julia Schiffner-Rohe, Mark Atwood&lt;/p&gt;

The type C feruloyl esterase FoFaeC from &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; is a newly discovered enzyme with high potential for use in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass but it shows low activity towards sinapates. In this work, small molecule docking simulations were employed in order to identify important residues for the binding of the four model methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, methyl ferulate/caffeate/sinapate/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumarate, to the predicted structure of FoFaeC. Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme’ active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket. Five mutant clones and the wild type were produced in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt; and biochemically characterized. All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. Although the affinity of all mutant clones was improved against the four model substrates, the catalytic efficiency and turnover rate decreased for the substrates containing a hydroxyl substitution.</content></content><author><name>Io Antonopoulou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Io Antonopoulou, Cameron Hunt, Gabriella Cerullo, Simona Varriale, Alexandra Gerogianni, Vincenza Faraco, Ulrika Rova, Paul Christakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

While the impacts of extreme and rising mean temperatures are well documented, increased thermal variability associated with climate change may also threaten ectotherm fitness and survival, but remains poorly explored. Using three wild collected coprophagic species &lt;i&gt;Copris elphenor&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Metacatharsius opacus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scarabaeus zambezianus&lt;/i&gt;, we explored the effects of thermal amplitude around the mean on thermal tolerance. Using standardized protocols, we measured traits of high- (critical thermal maxima [CT&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;] and heat knockdown time [HKDT]) and -low temperature tolerance (critical thermal minima [CT&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;], chill coma recovery time [CCRT] and supercooling points [SCPs]) following variable temperature pulses (δ0, δ3, δ6 and δ9°C) around the mean (27°C). Our results show that increased temperature variability may offset basal and plastic responses to temperature and differs across species and metrics tested. Furthermore, we also show differential effects of body mass, body water content (BWC) and body lipid content (BLC) on traits of thermal tolerance. For example, body mass significantly influenced &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elphenor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;zambezianus&lt;/i&gt; CT&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;zambezianus&lt;/i&gt; HKDT but not CT&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and CCRT. BWC significantly affected &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;opacus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elphenor&lt;/i&gt; CT&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and in only &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;opacus&lt;/i&gt; HKDT, CT&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and CCRT. Similarly, BLC only had a significant effect for &lt;i&gt;M opacus&lt;/i&gt; CT&lt;sub&gt;min.&lt;/sub&gt; These results suggest differential and species dependent effects of climate variability of thermal fitness traits. It is therefore likely that the ecological services provided by these species may be constrained in the face of climate change. This implies that, to develop more realistic predictions for the effects of climate change on insect biodiversity and ecosystem function, thermal variability is a significant determinant.</content></content><author><name>Casper Nyamukondiwa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Casper Nyamukondiwa, Frank Chidawanyika, Honest Machekano, Reyard Mutamiswa, Bryony Sands, Neludo Mgidiswa, Richard Wall&lt;/p&gt;

This implies that, to develop more realistic predictions for the effects of climate change on insect biodiversity and ecosystem function, thermal variability is a significant determinant.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198610</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528384685390</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163dad3854e:658f436:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5031027?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Diptarka Hait</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5031027?af=R</link><title>Communication: xDH double hybrid functionals can be qualitatively incorrect for non-equilibrium geometries: Dipole moment inversion and barriers to radical-radical association using XYG3 and XYGJ-OS</title><fingerprint>f328561b</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1525230059000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5031027?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><crawled>1525677623336</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16339790828:2611d90:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/588?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/588.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>78</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/588?rss=1</link><title>A new cancer immunotherapy suffers a setback</title><fingerprint>e4bf12ad</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7f2:93d646dc</id><author><name>Garber, K.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/588?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Cell Biology, Medicine, Diseases</item></keywords><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197879</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1527627600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527627600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197879</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197879</link><title>The fission yeast SPB component Dms1 is required to initiate forespore membrane formation and maintain meiotic SPB components</title><fingerprint>689267b2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Touko Niimi, Taro Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;
The spindle pole body (SPB) plays a central role in spore plasma membrane formation in addition to its recognized role in microtubule organization. During meiosis, a biomembrane called the forespore membrane (FSM) is newly formed at the SPB. Although several SPB proteins essential for the initiation of FSM formation (meiotic SPB components) have been identified, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of Dms1 as a component of the SPB. We show that FSM formation does not initiate in &lt;i&gt;dms1Δ&lt;/i&gt; cells. Dms1 protein is constitutively expressed throughout the life cycle and localizes to the SPB and the nuclear envelope. The predicted Dms1 protein has a transmembrane domain, which is required for correct localization at the SPB. Dms1 is essential for the proper localization of three meiotic SPB components, Spo15, Spo2, and Spo13, but these components do not affect localization of Dms1. Collectively, these results suggest that Dms1 anchors these meiotic SPB components to the SPB, thereby facilitating the initiation of FSM formation.</content></content><author><name>Touko Niimi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Touko Niimi, Taro Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the major causes of cancer related deaths. Although ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and/or high-cost magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been shown to improve early detection of liver cancer and mortality rates in high-risk individuals, such imaging based methods are limited by high rates of false positivity leading to unnecessary patient anxiety and invasive procedures. Complementary blood biomarkers could increase the accuracy of early detection. Although Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in blood is widely used in HCC screening and diagnosis, the false-negative rate as high as 30% and 40% is found in advanced HCC and early stage HCC respectively. We detected AFP messenger RNA (mRNA) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) in patient plasma using designed molecular beacons and a novel tethered lipoplex nanoparticle (TLN) biochip. Together with glypican-3 (GPC-3) mRNA, another well-known HCC marker, we observed much improved performance of AFP protein-based HCC detection. Comparing normal donors (N = 38) and HCC patients (N = 40), our TLN biochip using EV AFP and GPC-3 mRNAs provided an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.995, better than that of a single marker. This 2-mRNA combination also provided a perfect positive predictive value (PPV = 1) at a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.95 and 20% prevalence, while the blood AFP protein or plasma EV GPC3 mRNA alone could only provide a PPV of 0.61 and 0.79 respectively at the same conditions. Thus, this facile new method may complement current models for risk stratification in liver cancer screening, therapeutic monitoring, and after-treatment surveillance. However, large scale validation will need to be conducted to confirm its clinical potential.</content></content><author><name>Xinmei Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xinmei Wang, Kwang Joo Kwak, Zhaogang Yang, Aili Zhang, Xiaoli Zhang, Rachael Sullivan, Dan Lin, Robert L.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal allocation shifted when there were differences in transmission category proportions and progress along the HIV care continuum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The robustness of the results suggests that most health departments can use these analyses to guide the investment of CDC HIV prevention funds into strategies to prevent the most new cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Emine Yaylali</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emine Yaylali, Paul G.

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt;, currently affecting more than 200 million people. Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</content></content><author><name>Maria A.

Mitotane is the reference drug for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and the metabolic activation of the drug is considered as essential for its activity. The aim of this study was to assess the role of CYP11B1 on mitotane action and metabolism in H295R ACC cells to understand whether this enzyme may influence mitotane action. The simultaneous incubation with mitotane and metyrapone, an adrenolytic molecule targeting 11-beta-hydroxylase, did not influence mitotane-mediated cytotoxic effect and metabolism in H295R ACC cells. CYP11B1 silencing confirmed the lack of a significant metyrapone effect on mitotane action. The present findings do not support the view that CYP11B1 catalyzes a crucial step in the metabolic activation of mitotane and that CYP11B1 confers the adrenal specificity to mitotane.</content></content><author><name>Antonina Germano</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonina Germano, Laura Saba, Silvia De Francia, Ida Rapa, Paola Perotti, Alfredo Berruti, Marco Volante, Massimo Terzolo&lt;/p&gt;

Rab11 is an important protein subfamily in the RabGTPase family. These proteins physiologically function as key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking processes. Pathologically, Rab11 proteins are implicated in many diseases including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and type 2 diabetes. Although they are medically important, no previous study has found Rab11 allosteric binding sites where potential drug candidates can bind to. In this study, by employing multiple clustering approaches integrating principal component analysis, independent component analysis and locally linear embedding, we performed structural analyses of Rab11 and identified eight representative structures. Using these representatives to perform binding site mapping and virtual screening, we identified two novel binding sites in Rab11 and small molecules that can &lt;i&gt;preferentially&lt;/i&gt; bind to different conformations of these sites with high affinities. After identifying the binding sites and the residue interaction networks in the representatives, we computationally showed that these binding sites may &lt;i&gt;allosterically&lt;/i&gt; regulate Rab11, as these sites communicate with switch 2 region that binds to GTP/GDP. These two allosteric binding sites in Rab11 are also similar to two allosteric pockets in Ras that we discovered previously.</content></content><author><name>Ammu Prasanna Kumar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ammu Prasanna Kumar, Suryani Lukman&lt;/p&gt;

For about 70 years, L-glucose had been considered non-metabolizable by either mammalian or bacterial cells. Recently, however, an L-glucose catabolic pathway has been discovered in &lt;i&gt;Paracoccus laeviglucosivorans&lt;/i&gt;, and the genes responsible cloned. &lt;i&gt;Scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase is involved in the first step in the pathway that oxidizes L-glucose to produce L-glucono-1,5-lactone with concomitant reduction of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent manner. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex of &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and L-glucono-1,5-lactone at 1.8 Å resolution.

For about 70 years, L-glucose had been considered non-metabolizable by either mammalian or bacterial cells. Recently, however, an L-glucose catabolic pathway has been discovered in &lt;i&gt;Paracoccus laeviglucosivorans&lt;/i&gt;, and the genes responsible cloned. &lt;i&gt;Scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase is involved in the first step in the pathway that oxidizes L-glucose to produce L-glucono-1,5-lactone with concomitant reduction of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent manner. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex of &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and L-glucono-1,5-lactone at 1.8 Å resolution. The enzyme adopts a homo-tetrameric structure, similar to those of the inositol dehydrogenase family, and the electron densities of the bound sugar was clearly observed, allowing identification of the residues responsible for interaction with the substrate in the catalytic site. In addition to the conserved catalytic residues (Lys106, Asp191, and His195), another residue, His318, located in the loop region of the adjacent subunit, is involved in substrate recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of these residues in catalytic activity.

On the basis of these structural features, which have not been identified in the known inositol dehydrogenases, and a phylogenetic analysis of IDH family enzymes, we suggest a novel subfamily of the GFO/IDH/MocA family.

J. Nagelkerke, Eline van Onselen, Nils van Kessel, Rob S. E. W. Leuven&lt;/p&gt;
Invasions of Ponto-Caspian fish species into north-western European river basins accelerated since the opening of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal in 1992. Since 2002, at least five Ponto-Caspian alien fish species have arrived in The Netherlands. Four species belong to the Gobiidae family (&lt;i&gt;Neogobius fluviatilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neogobius melanostomus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ponticola kessleri&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Proterorhinus semilunaris&lt;/i&gt;) and one to the Cyprinidae family (&lt;i&gt;Romanogobio belingi&lt;/i&gt;). These species are expected to be potentially deleterious for the populations of four native benthic fish species: &lt;i&gt;Gobio gobio&lt;/i&gt; (Cyprinidae), &lt;i&gt;Barbatula barbatula&lt;/i&gt; (Nemacheilidae), &lt;i&gt;Cottus perifretum&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rhenanus&lt;/i&gt; (Cottidae). Invasion success may be dependent on competitive trophic interactions with native species, which are enabled and/or constrained by feeding-related morphological traits. Twenty-two functional feeding traits were measured in nine species (in total 90 specimens). These traits were quantitatively linked to the mechanical, chemical and behavioral properties of a range of aquatic resource categories, using a previously developed food-fish model (FFM).

Invasions of Ponto-Caspian fish species into north-western European river basins accelerated since the opening of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal in 1992. Since 2002, at least five Ponto-Caspian alien fish species have arrived in The Netherlands. Four species belong to the Gobiidae family (&lt;i&gt;Neogobius fluviatilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neogobius melanostomus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ponticola kessleri&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Proterorhinus semilunaris&lt;/i&gt;) and one to the Cyprinidae family (&lt;i&gt;Romanogobio belingi&lt;/i&gt;). These species are expected to be potentially deleterious for the populations of four native benthic fish species: &lt;i&gt;Gobio gobio&lt;/i&gt; (Cyprinidae), &lt;i&gt;Barbatula barbatula&lt;/i&gt; (Nemacheilidae), &lt;i&gt;Cottus perifretum&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rhenanus&lt;/i&gt; (Cottidae). Invasion success may be dependent on competitive trophic interactions with native species, which are enabled and/or constrained by feeding-related morphological traits. Twenty-two functional feeding traits were measured in nine species (in total 90 specimens). These traits were quantitatively linked to the mechanical, chemical and behavioral properties of a range of aquatic resource categories, using a previously developed food-fish model (FFM). The FFM was used to predict the trophic profile (TP) of each fish: the combined capacities to feed on each of the resource types. The most extreme TPs belonged to three alien species, indicating that they were most specialized among the studied species. Of these three, only &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kessleri&lt;/i&gt; overlapped with the two native &lt;i&gt;Cottus&lt;/i&gt; species, indicating potential trophic competition. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fluviatilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;belingi&lt;/i&gt; did not show any overlap, indicating that there is low trophic competition. The two remaining alien goby species (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanostomus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;semilunaris&lt;/i&gt;) had average TPs and could be considered generalist feeders. They overlapped with each other and with &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gobio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbatula&lt;/i&gt;, indicating potential trophic competition. This study suggests that both generalist and specialist species can be successful invaders. Since the FFM predicts potential interactions between species, it provides a tool to support horizon scanning and rapid risk assessments of alien species.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197636</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f42:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196969</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1525813200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1525813200000</updated><engagement>22</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196969</link><title>Widespread plant specialization in the polyphagous planthopper &amp;lt;i&gt;Hyalesthes obsoletus&amp;lt;/i&gt; (Cixiidae), a major vector of stolbur phytoplasma: Evidence of cryptic speciation</title><fingerprint>dc997060</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Kosovac, Jes Johannesen, Oliver Krstić, Milana Mitrović, Tatjana Cvrković, Ivo Toševski, Jelena Jović&lt;/p&gt;
The stolbur phytoplasma vector &lt;i&gt;Hyalesthes obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; is generally considered as a polyphagous species associated with numerous wild and cultivated plants. However, recent research in southeastern Europe, the distribution centre of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; and the area of most stolbur-inflicted crop diseases, points toward specific host-plant associations of the vector, indicating specific vector-based transmission routes. Here, we study the specificity of populations associated with four host-plants using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers, and we evaluate the evolution of host-shifts in &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt;. Host-plant use was confirmed for &lt;i&gt;Convolvulus arvensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Urtica dioica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitex agnus-castus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Crepis foetida&lt;/i&gt;. Mitochondrial genetic analysis showed sympatric occurrence of three phylogenetic lineages that were ecologically delineated by host-plant preference, but were morphologically inseparable. Nuclear data supported the existence of three genetic groups (Evanno’s ΔK(3) = 803.72) with average genetic membership probabilities &gt; 90%. While populations associated with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;arvensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dioica&lt;/i&gt; form a homogenous group, populations affiliated with &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agnus-castus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;foetida&lt;/i&gt; constitute two independent plant-associated lineages.

Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the “emerging” mycotoxins, which are produced by various &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1.

Harrison, Paul D. Phillips, Andrew T. Koppisch, Caren L. Freel Meyers&lt;/p&gt;
The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microenvironment of bacterial pathogens is often characterized by nutrient limitation. Consequently, conventional rich &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture conditions used widely to evaluate antibacterial agents are often poorly predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity, especially for agents targeting metabolic pathways. In one such pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is essential for production of isoprenoids in bacterial pathogens, relatively little is known about the influence of growth environment on antibacterial properties of inhibitors targeting enzymes in this pathway. The early steps of the MEP pathway are catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase and reductoisomerase (IspC). The in vitro antibacterial efficacy of the DXP synthase inhibitor butylacetylphosphonate (BAP) was recently reported to be strongly dependent upon growth medium, with high potency observed under nutrient limitation and exceedingly weak activity in nutrient-rich conditions. In contrast, the well-known IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has potent antibacterial activity in nutrient-rich conditions, but to date, its efficacy had not been explored under more relevant nutrient-limited conditions. The goal of this work was to thoroughly characterize the effects of BAP and fosmidomycin on bacterial cells under varied growth conditions. In this work, we show that activities of both inhibitors, alone and in combination, are strongly dependent upon growth medium, with differences in cellular uptake contributing to variance in potency of both agents. Fosmidomycin is dissimilar to BAP in that it displays relatively weaker activity in nutrient-limited compared to nutrient-rich conditions. Interestingly, while it has been generally accepted that fosmidomycin activity depends upon expression of the GlpT transporter, our results indicate for the first time that fosmidomycin can enter cells by an alternative mechanism under nutrient limitation. Finally, we show that the potency and relationship of the BAP-fosmidomycin combination also depends upon the growth medium, revealing a striking loss of BAP-fosmidomycin synergy under nutrient limitation. This change in BAP-fosmidomycin relationship suggests a shift in the metabolic and/or regulatory networks surrounding DXP accompanying the change in growth medium, the understanding of which could significantly impact targeting strategies against this pathway. More generally, our findings emphasize the importance of considering physiologically relevant growth conditions for predicting the antibacterial potential MEP pathway inhibitors and for studies of their intracellular targets.</content></content><author><name>Sara Sanders</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Sanders, David Bartee, Mackenzie J.

Serious game development for rehabilitation therapy is becoming increasingly popular because of the motivational advantages that these types of applications provide. Consequently, the need for a common process framework for this category of software development has become increasingly evident. The goal is to guarantee that products are developed and validated by following a coherent and systematic method that leads to high-quality serious games. This paper introduces a new process framework for the development of serious games for motor rehabilitation therapy. We introduce the new model and demonstrate its application for the development of a serious game for the improvement of the balance and postural control of adults with cerebral palsy. The development of this application has been facilitated by two technological transfer contracts and is being exploited by two different organizations. According to clinical measurements, patients using the application improved from high fall risk to moderate fall risk. We believe that our development strategy can be useful not only for motor rehabilitation therapy, but also for the development of serious games in many other rehabilitation areas.</content></content><author><name>Esperança Amengual Alcover</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Esperança Amengual Alcover, Antoni Jaume-i-Capó, Biel Moyà-Alcover&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Asthma is the most common chronic disease during pregnancy and it may have influence on pregnancy outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our goal was to assess the association between maternal asthma and the perinatal risks as well as possible effects of asthma medication.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was based on a nationwide Finnish register-based cohort between the years 1996 and 2012 in the Drug and Pregnancy Database. The register data comprised 962 405 singleton live and stillbirths, 898 333 (93.3%) pregnancies in mothers with neither confirmed asthma nor use of asthma medication (controls), and 26 674 (2.8%) pregnancies with confirmed maternal asthma. 71% of mothers with asthma used asthma medication. The diagnosis of asthma was based on the mothers’ right for subsidised medication which is carefully evaluated by strict criteria including pulmonary function testing. Odds ratio was used in comparison. Premature birth (PB), low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal death were the main outcome measures.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Maternal asthma was associated with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for perinatal mortality 1.24 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.46), preterm birth 1.18 (1.11 to 1.25), low birth weight 1.29 (1.21 to 1.37), fetal growth restriction (SGA) 1.32, (1.24 to 1.40), and asphyxia 1.09 (1.02 to 1.17). Asthma treatment reduced the increased risk of preterm birth aOR 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) but mothers with treated asthma had higher risks of fetal growth restriction (SGA) aOR 1.26 (1.10 to 1.45), and asphyxia aOR 1.37 (1.17 to 1.61) than mothers with untreated asthma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Asthma is associated with increased risks of perinatal mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction (SGA), and asphyxia. Asthma treatment reduces the risk of preterm delivery, but it does not seem to reduce other complications such as perinatal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Mari Kemppainen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mari Kemppainen, Anna-Maria Lahesmaa-Korpinen, Paula Kauppi, Martti Virtanen, Suvi M.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</content></content><author><name>Christi Patten</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christi Patten, James Levine, Ioannis Pavlidis, Joyce Balls-Berry, Arya Shah, Christine Hughes, Tabetha Brockman, Miguel Valdez Soto, Daniel Witt, Gabriel Koepp, Pamela Sinicrope, Jamie Richards&lt;/p&gt;

The balance between synthesis and degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix is severely altered in osteoarthritis, where degradation predominates. One reason for this imbalance is believed to be due to the ligation of the α5β1 integrin, the classic fibronectin (FN) receptor, with soluble FN fragments instead of insoluble FN fibrils, which induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. Our objective was to determine whether the lack of α5β1-FN binding influences cartilage morphogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and whether non-ligated α5β1 protects or aggravates the course of osteoarthritis in mice. We engineered mice (&lt;i&gt;Col2a-Cre;Fn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RGE/fl&lt;/sup&gt;), whose chondrocytes express an α5β1 binding-deficient FN, by substituting the aspartic acid of the RGD cell-binding motif with a glutamic acid (FN-RGE). At an age of 5 months the knee joints were stressed either by forced exercise (moderate mechanical load) or by partially resecting the meniscus followed by forced exercise (high mechanical load). Sections of femoral articular knees were analysed by Safranin-O staining and by immunofluorescence to determine tissue morphology, extracellular matrix proteins and matrix metalloproteinase expression. The articular cartilage from untrained control and &lt;i&gt;Col2a-Cre;Fn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RGE/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice was normal, while the exposure to high mechanical load induced osteoarthritis characterized by proteoglycan and collagen type II loss. In the &lt;i&gt;Col2a-Cre;Fn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RGE/fl&lt;/sup&gt; articular cartilage osteoarthritis progressed significantly faster than in wild type mice. Mechanistically, we observed increased expression of MMP-13 and MMP-3 metalloproteinases in FN-RGE expressing articular cartilage, which severely affected matrix remodelling. Our results underscore the critical role of FN-α5β1 adhesion as ECM sensor in circumstances of articular cartilage regeneration.</content></content><author><name>Maylin Almonte-Becerril</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maylin Almonte-Becerril, Irene Gimeno-LLuch, Olga Villarroya, María Benito-Jardón, Juan Bautista Kouri, Mercedes Costell&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The relative influence of prematurity vs. maternal social factors (socioeconomic status and education level) on academic performance has rarely been examined.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine the impact of prematurity and maternal social factors on academic performance from 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; through 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants born in 1998 at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The study sample included 58 extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, 23‒&amp;lt;28 weeks), 171 preterm (≥28‒&amp;lt;34 weeks), 228 late preterm (≥34‒&amp;lt;37 weeks), and 967 term ((≥37‒&amp;lt;42 weeks) infants. Neonatal and maternal variables were collected including maternal insurance status (proxy measure for socioeconomic status) and education level. The primary outcomes were literacy and mathematics achievement-test scores from 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; through 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade. Linear mixed models were used to identify significant predictors of academic performance. All two-way interactions between grade level, gestational-age (GA) groups, and social factors were tested for statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Prematurity, social factors, gender, race, gravidity, and Apgar score at one minute were critical determinants of academic performance. Favorable social factors were associated with a significant increase in both literacy and mathematic scores, while prematurity was associated with a significant decrease in mathematic scores. Examination of GA categories and social factors interaction suggested that the impact of social factors on test scores was similar for all GA groups. Furthermore, the impact of social factors varied from grade to grade for literacy, while the influence of either GA groups or social factors was constant across grades for mathematics. For example, an ELGAN with favorable social factors had a predicted literacy score 104.1 (P &amp;lt;.001), 98.2 (P &amp;lt;.001), and 76.4 (P &amp;lt;.01) points higher than an otherwise similar disadvantaged term infant at grades 3, 5, and 8, respectively. The difference in their predicted mathematic scores was 33.4 points for all grades (P &amp;lt;.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;While there were significant deficits in academic performance for ELGANs compared to PT, LPT, and term infants, the deficit could be offset by higher SES and better-educated mothers. These favorable social factors were critical to a child’s academic achievement. The role of socioeconomic factors should be incorporated in discussions on outcome with families of preterm infants.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nahed O.

For example, an ELGAN with favorable social factors had a predicted literacy score 104.1 (P &amp;lt;.001), 98.2 (P &amp;lt;.001), and 76.4 (P &amp;lt;.01) points higher than an otherwise similar disadvantaged term infant at grades 3, 5, and 8, respectively. The difference in their predicted mathematic scores was 33.4 points for all grades (P &amp;lt;.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;While there were significant deficits in academic performance for ELGANs compared to PT, LPT, and term infants, the deficit could be offset by higher SES and better-educated mothers. These favorable social factors were critical to a child’s academic achievement. The role of socioeconomic factors should be incorporated in discussions on outcome with families of preterm infants.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198083</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b93c:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018589?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Sina Youssefian</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018589?af=R</link><title>Thermal conductivity and rectification in asymmetric archaeal lipid membranes</title><fingerprint>f093b4a9</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1525236043000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018589?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><crawled>1525677623336</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16339790828:2611d9a:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0184-1</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Mitali Banerjee</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>24</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0184-1</link><unread>True</unread><title>Observation of half-integer thermal Hall conductance</title><fingerprint>f87c6eb4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation of half-integer thermal Hall conductance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation of half-integer thermal Hall conductance, Published online: 04 June 2018;

This is unprecedented for mucosal absorption of therapeutic peptides, and defines a technology with many other clinical applications.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34469</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Human Biology and Medicine</item></keywords><crawled>1527780963884</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163b6d7762c:3062eff:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0618-484</originId><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><author><name>Mark Ratner</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0618-484</link><unread>True</unread><title>Next-generation sequencing tests to become routine</title><fingerprint>90787c79</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next-generation sequencing tests to become routine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next-generation sequencing tests to become routine, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0618-484&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt0618-484&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Next-generation sequencing tests to become routine</content></content><published>1528268400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next-generation sequencing tests to become routine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next-generation sequencing tests to become routine, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0618-484&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt0618-484&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Next-generation sequencing tests to become routine</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0618-484</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_163d5e9c7a7:5e92041:7cfe07d6</id><crawled>1528302258087</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1526331600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1526331600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</link><title>Risk perception and sex behaviour in pregnancy and breastfeeding in high HIV prevalence settings: Programmatic implications for PrEP delivery</title><fingerprint>1f55ceaf</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dvora Joseph Davey, Elise Farley, Catriona Towriss, Yolanda Gomba, Linda-Gail Bekker, Pamina Gorbach, Steven Shoptaw, Thomas Coates, Landon Myer&lt;/p&gt;
HIV acquisition during pregnancy and breastfeeding significantly contributes toward paediatric HIV infection; however, little is known about risk behaviours in HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted twenty-six in-depth-interviews between July and December 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide among HIV-uninfected pregnant and recently postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition (defined as reporting ≥1 of the following: partner’s serostatus unknown or HIV-infected, recent condomless sex in pregnancy, and/or alcohol use during pregnancy) who attended primary healthcare services. Our study contextualizes factors related to risky sexual behaviours during pregnancy and postpartum periods and assesses knowledge and hypothetical acceptability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy. Translated and transcribed data were coded and analysed by three researchers using a thematic analysis approach. In interviews with HIV-uninfected pregnant/postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition, we identified common themes associated with sexual risk behaviours during pregnancy, including: lack of control over decisions in sex and condom use in pregnancy, low perceived risk (e.g. beliefs that their partner has the same HIV-negative serostatus), and socio-cultural beliefs around condom use during pregnancy (e.g. contact with sperm is essential for baby’s development). PrEP knowledge was low among HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women, and potential acceptability was good, though primary concerns were around the potential impact on the infant. While mothers presented a clear desire to protect themselves from HIV acquisition once pregnant, they also reported lack of control, and socio-cultural beliefs, like sex is good for the baby, that increased their risk of seroconversion. Mothers had limited PrEP awareness but reported hypothetical willingness to use PrEP because of concerns over HIV acquisition and onward mother to child transmission.</content></content><author><name>Dvora Joseph Davey</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dvora Joseph Davey, Elise Farley, Catriona Towriss, Yolanda Gomba, Linda-Gail Bekker, Pamina Gorbach, Steven Shoptaw, Thomas Coates, Landon Myer&lt;/p&gt;

We have developed our original tissue engineering technology “cell sheet engineering” utilizing temperature-responsive culture dishes. The cells are confluently grown on a temperature-responsive culture dish and can be harvested as a cell sheet by lowering temperature without enzymatic digestion. Cell sheets are high-cell-density tissues similar to actual living tissues, maintaining their structure and function. Based on this “cell sheet engineering”, we are trying to create functional cardiac tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells, for regenerative therapy and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing. Toward this purpose, it is necessary to evaluate the contractility of engineered cardiac cell sheets. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a contractile force measurement system and evaluated the contractility of human iPSC-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissues. By attaching the cardiac cell sheets on fibrin gel sheets, we created dynamically beating cardiac cell sheet-tissues. They were mounted to the force measurement system and the contractile force was measured stably and clearly. The absolute values of contractile force were around 1 mN, and the mean force value per cross-sectional area was 3.3 mN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are equivalent to or larger than many previously reported values, indicating the functionality of our engineered cardiac cell sheets. We also confirmed that both the contractile force and beating rate were significantly increased by the administration of adrenaline, which are the physiologically relevant responses for cardiac tissues. In conclusion, the force measurement system developed in the present study is valuable for the evaluation of engineered cardiac cell sheet-tissues, and for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing as well.</content></content><author><name>Daisuke Sasaki</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daisuke Sasaki, Katsuhisa Matsuura, Hiroyoshi Seta, Yuji Haraguchi, Teruo Okano, Tatsuya Shimizu&lt;/p&gt;

Further, our calculated UV‐vis absorbance and fluorescence spectra are in accordance with the experimental measurements. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25341?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1639679584a:2569c2:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05109-w</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Amy Maxmen</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>420</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05109-w</link><unread>True</unread><title>Why it’s hard to prove gender discrimination in science</title><fingerprint>e7beeb39</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it’s hard to prove gender discrimination in science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why it’s hard to prove gender discrimination in science, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05109-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05109-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Lack of transparency and unconscious biases make it hard to spot inequality.</content></content><published>1526367600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why it’s hard to prove gender discrimination in science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why it’s hard to prove gender discrimination in science, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05109-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05109-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Lack of transparency and unconscious biases make it hard to spot inequality.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05109-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16363912e22:3872f3b:2835af05</id><crawled>1526383848994</crawled><visual><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05109-w/d41586-018-05109-w_15741978.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16217</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Jorge A.

Determining how proteins interact to form stable complexes is of crucial importance, for example in the development of novel therapeutics. Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners, such as RosettaDock, might potentially emerge to become a promising alternative to traditional structure determination methods. However, while models virtually identical to the correct experimental structure can in some cases be generated, the main difficulty remains to discriminate correct or approximately correct models from decoys. This is due to the ruggedness of the free-energy landscape, the approximations intrinsic in the scoring functions, and the intrinsic flexibility of proteins. Here we show that molecular dynamics simulations performed starting from a number top-scoring models can not only discriminate decoys and identify the correct structure, but may also provide information on an initial map of the free energy landscape that elucidates the binding mechanism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nukuSUmhrVc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Filip Radom, Andreas Plückthun, Emanuele Paci&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The discussion on the use of bevacizumab is still ongoing and often doctors are deterred from using bevacizumab due to legal or political issues. Bevacizumab is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), albeit unregistered for the disease. Therefore, in some countries ophthalmologists use the equally effective but expensive drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept. We describe the economic consequences of this dilemma surrounding AMD treatment from a societal perspective.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We modelled cost-effectiveness of treatment with ranibizumab (as-needed), aflibercept (bimonthly) and bevacizumab (as-needed). Effectiveness was estimated by systematic review and meta-analysis. The drug with the most favourable cost-effectiveness profile compared to bevacizumab was used for threshold analyses. First, we determined how much we overspend per injection. Second, we calculated the required effectiveness to justify the current price and the reasonable price for a drug leading to optimal vision. Finally, we estimated how much Europe overspends if bevacizumab is not first choice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab treatment costs €27,087 per year, about €4,000 less than aflibercept and €6,000 less than ranibizumab. With similar effectiveness for all drugs as shown by meta-analysis, bevacizumab was the most cost-effective. Aflibercept was chosen for threshold analyses. Aflibercept costs €943 per injection, but we determined that the maximum price to be cost-effective is €533. Alternatively, at its current price, aflibercept should yield about twice the visual gain. Even when optimal vision can be achieved, the maximum price for any treatment is €37,453 per year. Most importantly, Europe overspends €335 million yearly on AMD treatment when choosing aflibercept over bevacizumab.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab is the most cost-effective treatment for AMD, yet is not the standard of care across Europe. The registered drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept lead to large overspending without additional health benefits. Health authorities should consider taking steps to implement bevacizumab into clinical practice as first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Freekje van Asten</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Freekje van Asten, Charlotte T.

Background &lt;p&gt;Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health problem that has substantial consequences on the physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health of women. This study examined the association between women’s attitudes towards wife-beating and their utilization of reproductive healthcare services.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Two waves of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data were analyzed using multivariate regression. Outcome variables were a set of reproductive healthcare services, namely contraception use, modern contraception use, antenatal visit by skilled health professionals (SHP), delivery in healthcare facilities, delivery by SHP and postnatal check up by SHP. Attitudes towards abuse were assessed by a set of five questions that asked the situation under which ‘hitting or beating’ one’s wife is justifiable.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Around 32% of the participants reported that hitting or beating wife by husband was justified in certain situations. There is a gradient in the relationship between number of healthcare services accessed and number of situations justified for beating wife. Women who strongly reject the justification of wife beating were more likely than those who reject that weakly to report contraception use, antenatal care by SHP, delivery in healthcare facilities, delivery care by SHP, and postnatal care by SHP.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Women’s attitudes towards ‘wife beating’ have a significant association with reproductive healthcare seeking behavior.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a cornerstone in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Yet, prolonged GC use is hampered by deleterious GC-related side effects and the emergence of GC resistance. To tackle and overcome these GC-related problems, the applicability of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators was studied, in search of fewer side-effects and at least equal therapeutic efficacy as classic GCs. Compound A (CpdA) is a prototypical example of such a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator and does not support GR-mediated transactivation. Here, we examined whether the combination of CpdA with the classic GC dexamethasone (Dex) may improve GC responsiveness of MM and ALL cell lines. We find that the combination of Dex and CpdA does not substantially enhance GC-mediated cell killing. In line, several apoptosis hallmarks, such as caspase 3/7 activity, PARP cleavage and the levels of cleaved-caspase 3 remain unchanged upon combining Dex with CpdA. Moreover, we monitor no additional inhibition of cell proliferation and the homologous downregulation of GR is not counteracted by the combination of Dex and CpdA. In addition, CpdA is unable to modulate Dex-liganded GR transactivation and transrepression, yet, Dex-mediated transrepression is also aberrant in these lymphoid cell lines. Together, transrepression-favoring compounds, alone or combined with GCs, do not seem a valid strategy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.</content></content><author><name>Dorien Clarisse</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dorien Clarisse, Karlien Van Wesemael, Jan Tavernier, Fritz Offner, Ilse M.

As demonstrated on a real data set, this algorithm gives good results and is efficient enough to be applicable to real-life data.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321471v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526266570217</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635c93a5e9:2bf07f2:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198409</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1527886800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527886800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198409</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198409</link><title>A fertility-restoring genotype of beet (&amp;lt;i&gt;Beta vulgaris&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.) is composed of a weak &amp;lt;i&gt;restorer-of-fertility&amp;lt;/i&gt; gene and a modifier gene tightly linked to the &amp;lt;i&gt;Rf1&amp;lt;/i&gt; locus</title><fingerprint>1bae1ed3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takumi Arakawa, Daisuke Uchiyama, Takashi Ohgami, Ryo Ohgami, Tomoki Murata, Yujiro Honma, Hiroyuki Hamada, Yosuke Kuroda, Kazunori Taguchi, Kazuyoshi Kitazaki, Tomohiko Kubo&lt;/p&gt;
Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a plant trait that involves interactions between nuclear- and mitochondrial genomes. In CMS, the nuclear &lt;i&gt;restorer-of-fertility&lt;/i&gt; gene (&lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;), a suppressor of male-sterility inducing mitochondria, is one of the best known genetic factors. Other unidentified genetic factors may exist but have not been well characterized. In sugar beet (&lt;i&gt;Beta vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L.), CMS is used for hybrid seed production, but few male-sterility inducing nuclear genotypes exist. Such genotypes could be introduced from a closely related plant such as leaf beet, but first the fertility restoring genotype of the related plant must be characterized. Here, we report the discovery of a Japanese leaf beet accession ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ that has both male-sterility inducing and fertility restoring genotypes. We crossed the leaf beet accession with a sugar beet CMS line, developed succeeding generations, and examined the segregation of two DNA markers that are linked to two sugar beet &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;s, &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt;. Only the &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt; marker co-segregated with fertility restoration in every generation, implying that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus in leaf beet is occupied by a non-restoring allele. Fertility restoration was incomplete without a genetic factor closely linked to &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt;, leading to the assumption that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus encodes a modifier that cannot restore fertility by itself but perhaps strengthens another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;. We sequenced the apparently non-restoring ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; gene-coding region and found that it closely resembles a restoring allele.

Thus, the universal anota2seq algorithm allows efficient and hitherto unprecedented interrogation of translatomes and enables studies of translational buffering which represents an unexplored mechanism for regulating of gene expression.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/106922v4?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526308570805</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635f1486b5:2fc205d:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/E4680.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Evan D.

Glial cells perform numerous functions to support neuron development and function, including axon wrapping, formation of the blood brain barrier, and enhancement of synaptic transmission. We have identified a novel gene, &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt;, which functions in glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Reducing Raw levels in glia results in morphological defects in the brain and ventral nerve cord, as well as defects in neuron function, as revealed by decreased locomotion in crawling assays. Examination of the number of glia along peripheral nerves reveals a reduction in glial number upon &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. The reduced number of glia along peripheral nerves occurs as a result of decreased glial proliferation. As Raw has been shown to negatively regulate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in other developmental contexts, we examined the expression of a JNK reporter and the downstream JNK target, &lt;i&gt;matrix metalloproteinase 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;mmp1&lt;/i&gt;), and found that &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown results in increased reporter activity and Mmp1 levels. These results are consistent with previous studies showing increased Mmp levels lead to nerve cord defects similar to those observed upon &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. In addition, knockdown of &lt;i&gt;puckered&lt;/i&gt;, a negative feedback regulator of JNK signaling, also causes a decrease in glial number. Thus, our studies have resulted in the identification of a new regulator of gliogenesis, and demonstrate that increased JNK signaling negatively impacts glial development.</content></content><author><name>Diana Luong</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Luong, Luselena Perez, Jennifer C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Elevated serum uric acid (sUA) concentrations are common in the general population and are associated with chronic metabolic conditions and adverse clinical outcomes. We evaluated secular trends in the burden of hyperuricaemia from 2006–2014 within the Irish health system.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the &lt;i&gt;National Kidney Disease Surveillance Programme&lt;/i&gt; was used to determine the prevalence of elevated sUA in adults, age &gt; 18 years, within the Irish health system. Hyperuricaemia was defined as sUA &gt; 416.4 μmol/L in men and &gt; 339.06 μmol/L in women, and prevalence was calculated as the proportion of patients per year with mean sUA levels above sex-specific thresholds. Temporal trends in prevalence were compared from 2006 to 2014 while general estimating equations (GEE) explored variation across calendar years expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2014, prevalence of hyperuricaemia increased from 19.7% to 25.0% in men and from 20.5% to 24.1% in women, P&amp;lt;0.001. The corresponding sUA concentrations increased significantly from 314.6 (93.9) in 2006 to 325.6 (96.2) in 2014, P&amp;lt;0.001. Age-specific prevalence increased in all groups from 2006 to 2014, and the magnitude of increase was similar for each age category. Adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics and illness indicators, the likelihood of hyperuricemia was greatest for patients in 2014; OR 1.45 (1.26–1.65) for men and OR 1.47 (1.29–1.67) in women vs 2006 (referent). Factors associated with hyperuricaemia included: worsening kidney function, elevated white cell count, raised serum phosphate and calcium levels, elevated total protein and higher haemoglobin concentrations, all P&amp;lt;0.001.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The burden of hyperuricaemia is substantial in the Irish health system and has increased in frequency over the past decade. Advancing age, poorer kidney function, measures of nutrition and inflammation, and regional variation all contribute to increasing prevalence, but these do not fully explain emerging trends.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Arun Kumar A.

Advancing age, poorer kidney function, measures of nutrition and inflammation, and regional variation all contribute to increasing prevalence, but these do not fully explain emerging trends.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198197</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527863770858</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bbc6feea:3922888:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05319-2</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Jeff Tollefson</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>380</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>630</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05319-2/d41586-018-05319-2_15808652.png</url><contentType>image/png</contentType></visual><engagement>51</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05319-2</link><title>US EPA science advisers question ‘secret science’ rule on data transparency</title><fingerprint>75489143</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;US EPA science advisers question ‘secret science’ rule on data transparency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US EPA science advisers question ‘secret science’ rule on data transparency, Published online: 01 June 2018;

Spatial capture-recapture modelling (SCR) is a powerful analytical tool to estimate density and derive information on space use and behaviour of elusive animals. Yet, SCR has been seldom applied to the study of ecologically keystone small mammals. Here we highlight its potential and requirements with a case study on common voles (&lt;i&gt;Microtus arvalis&lt;/i&gt;). First, we address mortality associated with live-trapping, which can be high in small mammals, and must be kept minimal. We designed and tested a nest box coupled with a classic Sherman trap and show that it allows a 5-fold reduction of mortality in traps. Second, we address the need to adjust the trapping grid to the individual home range to maximize spatial recaptures. In May-June 2016, we captured and tagged with transponders 227 voles in a 1.2-ha area during two monthly sessions. Using a Bayesian SCR with a multinomial approach, we estimated: (1) the baseline detection rate and investigated variation according to sex, time or behaviour (aversion/attraction after a previous capture); (2) the parameter sigma that describes how detection probability declines as a function of the distance to an individual´s activity centre, and investigated variation according to sex; and (3) density and population sex-ratio. We show that reducing the maximum distance between traps from 12 to 9.6m doubled spatial recaptures and improved model predictions. Baseline detection rate increased over time (after overcoming a likely aversion to entering new odourless traps) and was greater for females than males in June. The sigma parameter of males was twice that of females, indicating larger home ranges. Density estimates were of 142.92±38.50 and 168.25±15.79 voles/ha in May and June, respectively, with 2–3 times more females than males. We highlight the potential and broad applicability that SCR offers and provide specific recommendations for using it to study small mammals like voles.</content></content><author><name>Juan Romairone</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Romairone, José Jiménez, Juan José Luque-Larena, François Mougeot&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Achieving proper rotational alignment of the femoral component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for valgus knee is challenging because of lateral condylar hypoplasia and lateral cartilage erosion. Gap-based navigation-assisted TKA enables surgeons to determine the angle of femoral component rotation (FCR) based on the posterior condylar axis. This study evaluated the possible factors that affect the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Between 2008 and 2016, 28 knees were enrolled. The dependent variable for this study was FCR based on the posterior condylar axis, which was obtained from the navigation system archives. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might predict FCR, including body mass index (BMI), Kellgren-Lawrence grade (K-L grade), lateral distal femoral angles obtained from the navigation system and radiographs (NaviLDFA, XrayLDFA), hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis, lateral gap under varus stress (LGVS), medial gap under valgus stress (MGVS), and side-to-side difference (STSD, MGVS − LGVS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean FCR was 6.1° ± 2.0°. Of all the potentially predictive factors evaluated in this study, only NaviLDFA (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = −0.668) and XrayLDFA (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = −0.714) predicted significantly FCR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The LDFAs, as determined using radiographs and the navigation system, were both predictive of the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis in gap-based TKA for valgus knee. A 1° increment with NaviLDFA led to a 0.668° decrement in FCR, and a 1° increment with XrayLDFA led to a 0.714° decrement. This suggests that symmetrical lateral condylar hypoplasia of the posterior and distal side occurs in lateral compartment end-stage osteoarthritis with valgus deformity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Sung-Sahn Lee</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sung-Sahn Lee, Yong-In Lee, Dong-Uk Kim, Dae-Hee Lee, Young-Wan Moon&lt;/p&gt;

Transgenic mouse models are indispensable tools to mimic human diseases and analyze the effectiveness of related new drugs. For a long time amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research depended on only a few mouse models that exhibit a very strong and early phenotype, e.g. SOD1 mice, resulting in a short treatment time window. By now, several models are available that need to be characterized to highlight characteristics of each model. Here we further characterized the mThy1-hTDP-43 transgenic mouse model TAR6/6 that overexpresses wild type human TARDBP, also called TDP-43, under control of the neuronal Thy-1 promoter presented by Wils and colleagues, 2010, by using biochemical, histological and behavioral readouts. Our results show that TAR6/6 mice exhibit a strong TDP-43 expression in the hippocampus, spinal cord, hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. Apart from prominent protein expression in the nucleus, TDP-43 protein was found at lower levels in the cytosol of transgenic mice. Additionally, we detected insoluble TDP-43 in the cortex, motoneuron loss, and increased neuroinflammation in the central nervous system of TAR6/6 animals. Behavioral analyses revealed early motor deficits in the clasping- and wire suspension test as well as decreased anxiety in the elevated plus maze. Further motor tests showed differences at later time points compared to non-transgenic littermates, thus allowing the observation of onset and severity of such deficits. Together, TAR6/6 mice are a valuable tool to test new ALS/FTLD drugs that target TDP-43 expression and insolubility, neuroinflammation, motoneuron loss or other TDP-43 related downstream signaling pathways since these mice exhibit a later pathology as previously used ALS/FTLD mouse models.</content></content><author><name>Barbara Scherz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Barbara Scherz, Roland Rabl, Stefanie Flunkert, Siegfried Rohler, Joerg Neddens, Nicole Taub, Magdalena Temmel, Ute Panzenboeck, Vera Niederkofler, Robert Zimmermann, Birgit Hutter-Paier&lt;/p&gt;

Together, TAR6/6 mice are a valuable tool to test new ALS/FTLD drugs that target TDP-43 expression and insolubility, neuroinflammation, motoneuron loss or other TDP-43 related downstream signaling pathways since these mice exhibit a later pathology as previously used ALS/FTLD mouse models.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197674</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709405e:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05347-y</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Easter Island’s stone heads got their huge hats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Easter Island’s stone heads got their huge hats, Published online: 05 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05347-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05347-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ramps and ropes may have allowed small groups of people to move massive stone cylinders.</description><author><name>NA</name></author><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163cfaf7bc1:5475352:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05347-y</link><title>How Easter Island’s stone heads got their huge hats</title><fingerprint>a6215971</fingerprint><engagement>8</engagement><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Easter Island’s stone heads got their huge hats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Easter Island’s stone heads got their huge hats, Published online: 05 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05347-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05347-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ramps and ropes may have allowed small groups of people to move massive stone cylinders.</content></content><published>1528182000000</published><engagementRate>0.11</engagementRate><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05347-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528197774273</crawled><visual><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05347-y/d41586-018-05347-y_15819582.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5564.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Philippe Herman–Bausier, Cristina Labate, Aisling M.

I remember wondering what the chemical biology community would make out of these things, and I wanted to report on at least one ingenious answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general situation in the field is when you have a big pile of RNA or DNA pieces, and you want to analyze them – sort them out, determine how many different ones are in there and which ones are present more than the others. This is the underlying problem that “RNA-seq” assays are trying to answer: when you perturb some cells by changing something about their environment, what genes’ transcriptions get affected? What protein levels go up or down? One reasonable proxy for those is the levels of various mRNAs, but there’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of RNA in a cell, and sorting through it looking for changes has been nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some steps that a lot of these assays use to clean up the sample and get it into a form that can be more easily analyzed. The clean-up often involves some method to get all the ribosomal RNA out of there or to direct your readout away from it somehow, because that’s the majority of the RNA in cell lysate, and you don’t want your assay technology chasing it. Then there’s usually a fragmentation step, to break up the mRNAs into useful-sized pieces (which will be reassembled later on, computationally). Another common step is the use of reverse transcriptase enzymes to make complementary DNA out of all those mRNA pieces, because our techniques to amplify and sequence DNA are so flippin’ powerful. There’s often a step that tries to stick some sort of unique tag/label/identifier onto each DNA piece as well, using ligase enzymes, to aid in keeping track of all this stuff. These enzymes are the key to the whole business, along with modern sequencer technology and its associated computing prowess to reassemble everything from the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickSeq&quot;&gt;“Click-seq” variant&lt;/a&gt; works, though. You take your pile of mRNAs and expose them to reverse transcriptase, as before. But this time, you feed in a set amount of azide-containing nucleotides along with the usual mix of normal 2-deoxynucleotides to make your complementary DNAs. The thing is, these are chain-terminating residues for the RT enzyme, so what you end up with is a random heap of cDNA pieces, all of which end (on the 3′) with an azidonucleotide. And these turn into handles for introducing those labels/barcodes/identifiers. This way you avoid having to do a separate fragmentation step, because the reverse transcriptase has already fragmented things for you as it randomly choked on the azidonucleotides. And you avoid having to use the ligase enzymes to label everything, which can be expensive – you put those on via azide/alkyne reactions instead. The clicked oligos are still viable for PCR and sequencing, as it turns out, so that part of the process works fine, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7514-3_6&quot;&gt;the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; avoids some recombination artifacts that the other variants can be vulnerable to (ligases ligating the wrong things, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, it’s also good for picking up real recombination events that might be biologically relevant, but rare on the absolute scale. This happens with some viruses, and the technique &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006365&quot;&gt;has been used&lt;/a&gt; to look at so-called “defective interfering” RNAs which emerge over time in viral infections. These are somewhat mysterious – in some cases, they seem to hijack and (as the name says) perhaps interfere with the usual infectious cycle, but they may also prolong it and make it worse. It looks like some viruses have evolved to let these things accumulate, and there must be a reason for that, too. The only way to unravel all that is with a good enough RNA analysis technique, and the clicked nucleotides just may be providing one.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1526915580000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I’ve written a few times about an odd sort of unnatural DNA sequence, where some of the nucleotides are connected via “click” triazole units rather than the traditional polyphosphate backbone.

Ischemic stroke remains an important cause of disability and mortality. Hypertension is a critical risk factor for the development of ischemic stroke. Control of risk factors, including hypertension, is therefore important for the prevention of ischemic stroke. Linalyl acetate (LA) has been reported to have therapeutic effects in ischemic stroke by modulating intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and having anti-oxidative properties. The preventive efficacy of LA has not yet been determined. This study therefore investigated the preventive efficacy of LA in rat aortas exposed to hypertension related-ischemic injury, and the mechanism of action of LA.Hypertension was induced &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; following ischemic injury to the aorta induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Effects of LA were assayed by western blotting, by determining concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by vascular contractility assays. LA significantly reduced systolic blood pressure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, LA suppressed ischemic injury-induced expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit p47&lt;sup&gt;phox&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as ROS production, LDH release, and ROS-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase suppression. These findings indicate that LA has anti-hypertensive properties that can prevent hypertension-related ischemic injury and can prevent NADPH oxidase-induced production of ROS.</content></content><author><name>Yu Shan Hsieh</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Shan Hsieh, Soonho Kwon, Hui Su Lee, Geun Hee Seol&lt;/p&gt;

Sleep science is entering a new era, thanks to new data-driven analysis approaches that, combined with mouse gene–editing technologies, show a promise in functional genomics and translational research. However, the investigation of sleep is time consuming and not suitable for large-scale phenotypic datasets, mainly due to the need for subjective manual annotations of electrophysiological states. Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of sleep, with all its physiological aspects, is not fully accounted for by the current system of sleep stage classification. In this study, we present a new data-driven analysis approach offering a plethora of novel features for the characterization of sleep. This novel approach allowed for identifying several substages of sleep that were hidden to standard analysis. For each of these substages, we report an independent set of homeostatic responses following sleep deprivation. By using our new substages classification, we have identified novel differences among various genetic backgrounds. Moreover, in a specific experiment with the &lt;i&gt;Zfhx3&lt;/i&gt; mouse line, a recent circadian mutant expressing both shortening of the circadian period and abnormal sleep architecture, we identified specific sleep states that account for genotypic differences at specific times of the day. These results add a further level of interaction between circadian clock and sleep homeostasis and indicate that dissecting sleep in multiple states is physiologically relevant and can lead to the discovery of new links between sleep phenotypes and genetic determinants. Therefore, our approach has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding of sleep physiology through the study of single mutations. Moreover, this study paves the way to systematic high-throughput analyses of sleep.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bBGe8ybdGnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527623103626</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou, Diego Sona, Matteo Zanotto, Glenda Lassi, Celina Garcia-Garcia, Valter Tucci, Vittorio Murino&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover, this study paves the way to systematic high-throughput analyses of sleep.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bBGe8ybdGnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><author><name>Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/bBGe8ybdGnU/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527616392783</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163ad084e4f:123fd5:ed160cc3</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16182</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Sara Fattinger</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16182</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16182</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Author Correction: Deep sleep maintains learning efficiency of the human brain</title><fingerprint>44f5b10c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Deep sleep maintains learning efficiency of the human brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Deep sleep maintains learning efficiency of the human brain, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16182&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16182&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Deep sleep maintains learning efficiency of the human brain&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/04kkTCrLI9U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1527231600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Deep sleep maintains learning efficiency of the human brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Deep sleep maintains learning efficiency of the human brain, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16182&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16182&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Deep sleep maintains learning efficiency of the human brain&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/04kkTCrLI9U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/04kkTCrLI9U/ncomms16182</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527241555636</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16396b0beb4:2ae372:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328591v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Ghatak, S.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/328591</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328591v1?rss=1</link><title>The Y-ome defines the thirty-four percent of Escherichia coli genes that lack experimental evidence of function [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>86f6139d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Experimental studies of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 often implicate poorly annotated genes in cellular phenotypes.

Using 3D anatomical landmarks from adult human head MRIs, we assessed the magnitude of inter-operator differences in Procrustes-based geometric morphometric analyses. An in depth analysis of both absolute and relative error was performed in a subsample of individuals with replicated digitization by three different operators. The effect of inter-operator differences was also explored in a large sample of more than 900 individuals. Although absolute error was not unusual for MRI measurements, including bone landmarks, shape was particularly affected by differences among operators, with up to more than 30% of sample variation accounted for by this type of error. The magnitude of the bias was such that it dominated the main pattern of bone and total (all landmarks included) shape variation, largely surpassing the effect of sex differences between hundreds of men and women. In contrast, however, we found higher reproducibility in soft-tissue nasal landmarks, despite relatively larger errors in estimates of nasal size. Our study exemplifies the assessment of measurement error using geometric morphometrics on landmarks from MRIs and stresses the importance of relating it to total sample variance within the specific methodological framework being used. In summary, precise landmarks may not necessarily imply negligible errors, especially in shape data; indeed, size and shape may be differentially impacted by measurement error and different types of landmarks may have relatively larger or smaller errors. Importantly, and consistently with other recent studies using geometric morphometrics on digital images (which, however, were not specific to MRI data), this study showed that inter-operator biases can be a major source of error in the analysis of large samples, as those that are becoming increasingly common in the &apos;era of big data&apos;.</content></content><author><name>Amro Daboul</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amro Daboul, Tatyana Ivanovska, Robin Bülow, Reiner Biffar, Andrea Cardini&lt;/p&gt;

Hand hygiene practice in hospitals is unfortunately still widely insufficient, even though it is known that transmitting pathogens via hands is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour. Electronic monitoring and feedback devices were installed in hospital patient rooms on top of hand-rub dispensers, next to the doorway, for a period of 17 weeks. In the emoticon condition, screens at the devices activated whenever a person entered or exited the room. Before using the alcohol-based hand-rub dispenser, a frowny face was displayed, indicating that hand hygiene should be performed. If the dispenser was subsequently used, this picture changed to a smiley face to positively reinforce the correct behaviour. Hand hygiene behaviour in the emoticon rooms significantly outperformed the behaviour in three other tested conditions. The strong effect in this field experiment indicates that activating injunctive norms may be a promising approach to improve hand hygiene behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</content></content><author><name>Susanne Gaube</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Gaube, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, Daniel Dollinger, Eva Lermer&lt;/p&gt;

Pollen analysis is widely used to verify the geographic origin of honeys, but has never been employed in Australia. In this study, we analysed the pollen content of 173 unblended honey samples sourced from most of the commercial honey producing regions in southern Australia. Southern Australian vegetation is dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; (Myrtaceae) forests and, as expected, most Australian honeys are palynologically dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;, while other important components include Myrtaceae taxa such as &lt;i&gt;Corymbia&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Angophora&lt;/i&gt; and the tribe Leptospermeae; plus Brassicaceae, &lt;i&gt;Echium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Macadamia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acacia&lt;/i&gt;. An important feature of the honeys is the number of Myrtaceae pollen morphotypes per sample, which is generally high (mean = 4.6) compared to honeys produced outside of Australia, including &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys produced in the Mediterranean region, and honeys produced in South America, which has its own rich indigenous Myrtaceae flora. In the latter regions, the number of Myrtaceae morphotypes is apparently generally ≤2. A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</content></content><author><name>J.

Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526493611198</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a1c04be:41f7c59:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26156-3</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Ximena Garate</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>499</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26156-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26156_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26156-3</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26156-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Identification of the miRNAome of early mesoderm progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells</title><fingerprint>df38a464</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identification of the miRNAome of early mesoderm progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identification of the miRNAome of early mesoderm progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26156-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26156-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Identification of the miRNAome of early mesoderm progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/VPEG67J4ktg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1527058800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identification of the miRNAome of early mesoderm progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identification of the miRNAome of early mesoderm progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26156-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26156-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Identification of the miRNAome of early mesoderm progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/VPEG67J4ktg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/VPEG67J4ktg/s41598-018-26156-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527067098482</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1638c4abd72:743cf23:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004526</originId><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><published>1527627600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527627600000</updated><engagement>1</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004526</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004526</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Zbtb7a is a transducer for the control of promoter accessibility by NF-kappa B and multiple other transcription factors</title><fingerprint>8694d8b7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by José Miguel Ramos Pittol, Agata Oruba, Gerhard Mittler, Simona Saccani, Dominic van Essen&lt;/p&gt;
Gene expression in eukaryotes is controlled by DNA sequences at promoter and enhancer regions, whose accessibility for binding by regulatory proteins dictates their specific patterns of activity. Here, we identify the protein Zbtb7a as a factor required for inducible changes in accessibility driven by transcription factors (TFs). We show that Zbtb7a binds to a significant fraction of genomic promoters and enhancers, encompassing many target genes of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) p65 and a variety of other TFs. While Zbtb7a binding is not alone sufficient to directly activate promoters, it is required to enable TF-dependent control of accessibility and normal gene expression. Using p65 as a model TF, we show that Zbtb7a associates with promoters independently of client TF binding. Moreover, the presence of prebound Zbtb7a can specify promoters that are amenable to TF-induced changes in accessibility. Therefore, Zbtb7a represents a widely used promoter factor that transduces signals from other TFs to enable control of accessibility and regulation of gene expression.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0hCOgv8f0oI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527623103626</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by José Miguel Ramos Pittol, Agata Oruba, Gerhard Mittler, Simona Saccani, Dominic van Essen&lt;/p&gt;

By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100% of the genes in the original data set with 74% less redundancy, or 95% of the genes with 88% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place. Conclusion: Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised. Pathways are not altered from their original form, allowing biological knowledge regarding the data set to be directly applicable. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to prioritise redundancy reduction, pathway size control or gene set coverage. The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</content></content><published>1526022000000</published><description>Background: The consolidation of pathway databases, such as KEGG[1], Reactome[2]and ConsensusPathDB[3], has generated widespread biological interest, however the issue of pathway redundancy impedes the use of these consolidated datasets.

The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526078095893</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635157c215:1f2da93:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025190?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Minglang Wang</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025190?af=R</link><title>Effect of molecular conformations on the electronic transport in oxygen-substituted alkanethiol molecular junctions</title><fingerprint>8147d7bb</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1526268744000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025190?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526387566858</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16363c9e90a:38e659d:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1081?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1528396622000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1081.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1081?rss=1</link><title>Injustices of foreign investment in coal</title><fingerprint>91f2d3b5</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163dba51793:6879def:2835af05</id><author><name>Bashir, S., Niazi, N.

The establishment of agricultural matrices generally involves deforestation, which leads to fragmentation of the remaining forest. This fragmentation can affect forest dynamics both positively and negatively. Since most animal species are affected, certain groups can be used to measure the impact of such fragmentation. This study aimed to measure the impacts of agricultural crops (matrices) on ant communities of adjacent lower montane Atlantic rainforest fragments. We sampled nine forest fragments at locations surrounded by different agricultural matrices, namely: coffee (3 replicates); sugarcane (3); and pasture (3). At each site we installed pitfall traps along a 500 m transect from the interior of the matrix to the interior of the fragment (20 pitfall traps ~25 m apart). Each transect was partitioned into four categories: interior of the matrix; edge of the matrix; edge of the fragment; and interior of the fragment. For each sample site, we measured ant species richness and ant community composition within each transect category. Ant richness and composition differed between fragments and matrices. Each sample location had a specific composition of ants, probably because of the influence of the nature and management of the agricultural matrices. Species composition in the coffee matrix had the highest similarity to its corresponding fragment. The variability in species composition within forest fragments surrounded by pasture was greatest when compared with forest fragments surrounded by sugarcane or, to a lesser extent, coffee. Functional guild composition differed between locations, but the most representative guild was ‘generalist’ both in the agricultural matrices and forest fragments. Our results are important for understanding how agricultural matrices act on ant communities, and also, how these isolated forest fragments could act as an island of biodiversity in an ‘ocean of crops’.</content></content><author><name>Diego Santana Assis</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Santana Assis, Iracenir Andrade Dos Santos, Flavio Nunes Ramos, Katty Elena Barrios-Rojas, Jonathan David Majer, Evaldo Ferreira Vilela&lt;/p&gt;

Research on familiar faces has recurrently been conducted in different domains, such as, psycholinguistics, memory, attention, face processing, aging studies, etc. In general, photographs of celebrities, their proper names, or their occupations have been the materials mainly employed in those types of studies. These stimuli are, however, very constrained by the geographic and sociocultural contexts in which the studies are conducted, and, in spite of their relevance for psychological research, there are no normative studies for celebrities in Spain. With the aim of filling this gap, the photographs and names of the 118 most frequently produced celebrities in Spain were collected. For each celebrity, values for 13 different indices (including psycholinguistic properties, naming times, and emotional indicators) were obtained from a young adult Spanish sample. Regression analyses on the data indicated that the main determinant in naming times and ToTs was the percentage of correct responses. Face agreement was also a significant predictor of ToTs. Results were compared with previous celebrity norms in other languages, and discussed in relation to the current models of face processing. These norms are likely to make a useful contribution to the design of more controlled research and applied tools in Psychology.</content></content><author><name>Alejandra Marful</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alejandra Marful, Antonio M.

Aiming at the design of an allosteric modulator of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)–Immunoglobulin G (IgG) interaction, we developed a new methodology including NMR fragment screening, X-ray crystallography, and magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR at 100 kHz after sedimentation, exploiting very fast spinning of the nondeuterated soluble 42 kDa receptor construct to obtain resolved proton-detected 2D and 3D NMR spectra. FcRn plays a crucial role in regulation of IgG and serum albumin catabolism. It is a clinically validated drug target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases caused by pathogenic antibodies via the inhibition of its interaction with IgG. We herein present the discovery of a small molecule that binds into a conserved cavity of the heterodimeric, extracellular domain composed of an α-chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m) (FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt;, 373 residues). X-ray crystallography was used alongside NMR at 100 kHz MAS with sedimented soluble protein to explore possibilities for refining the compound as an allosteric modulator. Proton-detected MAS NMR experiments on fully protonated [&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C,&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]-labeled FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt; yielded ligand-induced chemical-shift perturbations (CSPs) for residues in the binding pocket and allosteric changes close to the interface of the two receptor heterodimers present in the asymmetric unit as well as potentially in the albumin interaction site. X-ray structures with and without ligand suggest the need for an optimized ligand to displace the α-chain with respect to β2m, both of which participate in the FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt;–IgG interaction site. Our investigation establishes a method to characterize structurally small molecule binding to nondeuterated large proteins by NMR, even in their glycosylated form, which may prove highly valuable for structure-based drug discovery campaigns.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S9m_cYKMaok&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526927052559</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Stöppler, Alex Macpherson, Susanne Smith-Penzel, Nicolas Basse, Fabien Lecomte, Hervé Deboves, Richard D.

Our investigation establishes a method to characterize structurally small molecule binding to nondeuterated large proteins by NMR, even in their glycosylated form, which may prove highly valuable for structure-based drug discovery campaigns.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S9m_cYKMaok&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><author><name>Daniel Stöppler</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/S9m_cYKMaok/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526924854361</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16383d04459:d57e1:d63e3ae2</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5028144?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Santosh Rathan Paul Bandlamudi</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5028144?af=R</link><title>Communication: Potentials of mean force study of ionic liquid ion pair aggregation in polar covalent molecule solvents</title><fingerprint>343770f</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1527216120000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5028144?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527492817805</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163a5aab38d:1587661:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4930.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Hyo Jung Kim, Ji-Hwan Park, Jingil Kim, Jung Ju Kim, Sunghyun Hong, Jeongsik Kim, Jin Hee Kim, Hye Ryun Woo, Changbong Hyeon, Pyung Ok Lim, Hong Gil Nam, Daehee Hwang</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4930</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4930.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><title>Time-evolving genetic networks reveal a NAC troika that negatively regulates leaf senescence in Arabidopsis [Plant Biology]</title><fingerprint>da89ee54</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Senescence is controlled by time-evolving networks that describe the temporal transition of interactions among senescence regulators.

Potential confounders (e.g. age, ischemia time, MELD score) were comparable. One-year patient and graft survival were similar. Frequencies of rejections, primary-non function or re-transplantation were not different.

Herbivores can modify the rate of shrub and treeline advance. Both direct and indirect effects of herbivory may simultaneously interact to affect the growth rates of plants at this ecotone. We investigated the effect of snowshoe hare herbivory on the height of white spruce at two treeline locations in Alaska, USA. White spruce is expanding its distribution both upwards in elevation and northward in latitude because of climate warming, and snowshoe hares are already present in areas likely to be colonized by spruce. We hypothesized that herbivory would result in browsed individuals having reduced height, suggesting herbivory is a direct, negative effect on spruce treeline advance. We found an interactive effect between browsing history and spruce age. When young (under 30 years old), individuals that were browsed tended to be taller than unbrowsed individuals. However, older seedlings (over 30 years old) that had been browsed were shorter than unbrowsed individuals of the same age. Hares suppress faster growing individuals that are initially taller by preferentially browsing them as they emerge above the winter snowpack. This reduced height, in combination with increased mortality associated with browsing, is predicted to slow the advance of both latitudinal and altitudinal treeline expansions and alter the structure of treeline forests.</content></content><author><name>Justin Olnes</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Olnes, Knut Kielland, Hélène Genet, Glenn P.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell’s machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp, and &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins.</content></content><author><name>Zhila Esna Ashari</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhila Esna Ashari, Nairanjana Dasgupta, Kelly A.

Comprehensive tests with various pair potentials show that the new method generally surpasses the Iterative Boltzmann Inversion method in terms of reliability of the numerical solution for the particle pair potential. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25225?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1639679584a:2569b6:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4157</originId><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><author><name>Melanie Senior</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4157</link><unread>True</unread><title>Beating the organ clock</title><fingerprint>bfd8b5a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beating the organ clock&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beating the organ clock, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4157&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4157&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Donor organ monitoring and ex vivo perfusion technology are transforming transplantation and offering new therapeutic opportunities.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are one of the important factors in controlling gene expression and elucidation of their roles has been attracting great interest. We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</content></content><author><name>Ryo Komura</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Komura, Wataru Aoki, Keisuke Motone, Atsushi Satomura, Mitsuyoshi Ueda&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH. Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Tatsuyuki Sato</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuyuki Sato, Masaru Hatano, Yukiko Iwasaki, Hisataka Maki, Akihito Saito, Shun Minatsuki, Toshiro Inaba, Eisuke Amiya, Keishi Fujio, Masafumi Watanabe, Kazuhiko Yamamoto, Issei Komuro&lt;/p&gt;

Spatially explicit modelling allows to estimate population abundance and predict species’ distribution in relation to environmental factors. Abiotic factors are the main determinants of a herbivore´s response to environmental heterogeneity on large spatiotemporal scales. We assessed the influence of elevation, geographic location and distance to the coast on the seasonal abundance and distribution of guanaco (&lt;i&gt;Lama guanicoe&lt;/i&gt;) in central Tierra del Fuego, by means of spatially explicit modelling. The estimated abundance was 23,690 individuals for the non-breeding season and 33,928 individuals for the breeding season. The factors influencing distribution and abundance revealed to be the elevation for the non-breeding season, and the distance to the coast and geographic location for the breeding season. The southwest of the study area presented seasonal abundance variation and the southeast and northeast presented high abundance during both seasons. The elevation would be the driving factor of guanaco distribution, as individuals move to lower areas during the non-breeding season and ascend to high areas during the breeding season. Our results confirm that part of the guanaco population performs seasonal migratory movements and that the main valleys present important wintering habitats for guanacos as well as up-hill zones during summer. This type of study would help to avoid problems of scale mismatch and achieve better results in management actions and is an example of how to assess important seasonal habitats from evaluations of abundance and distribution patterns.</content></content><author><name>Celina E.

Bernabeu-Martínez, Mateo Ramos Merino, Juan M. Santos Gago, Luis M. Álvarez Sabucedo, Carmina Wanden-Berghe, Javier Sanz-Valero&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;To review the scientific literature related to the safe handling of hazardous drugs (HDs).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Critical analysis of works retrieved from MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINHAL, Web of Science and LILACS using the terms &amp;quot;Hazardous Substances&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Antineoplastic Agents&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Cytostatic Agents&amp;quot;, applying &amp;quot;Humans&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Guidelines&amp;quot; as filters. Date of search: January 2017.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 1100 references were retrieved, and from those, 61 documents were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria: 24 (39.3%) documents related to recommendations about HDs; 27 (44.3%) about antineoplastic agents, and 10 (33.3%) about other types of substances (monoclonal antibodies, gene medicine and other chemical and biological agents). In 14 (23.3%) guides, all the stages in the manipulation process involving a risk due to exposure were considered. Only one guide addressed all stages of the handling process of HDs (including stages with and without the risk of exposure). The most described stages were drug preparation (41 guides, 67.2%), staff training and/or patient education (38 guides, 62.3%), and administration (37 guides, 60.7%). No standardized informatics system was found that ensured quality management, traceability and minimization of the risks associated with these drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most of the analysed guidelines limit their recommendations to the manipulation of antineoplastics.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To review the scientific literature related to the safe handling of hazardous drugs (HDs).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Critical analysis of works retrieved from MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINHAL, Web of Science and LILACS using the terms &amp;quot;Hazardous Substances&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Antineoplastic Agents&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Cytostatic Agents&amp;quot;, applying &amp;quot;Humans&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Guidelines&amp;quot; as filters. Date of search: January 2017.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 1100 references were retrieved, and from those, 61 documents were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria: 24 (39.3%) documents related to recommendations about HDs; 27 (44.3%) about antineoplastic agents, and 10 (33.3%) about other types of substances (monoclonal antibodies, gene medicine and other chemical and biological agents). In 14 (23.3%) guides, all the stages in the manipulation process involving a risk due to exposure were considered. Only one guide addressed all stages of the handling process of HDs (including stages with and without the risk of exposure). The most described stages were drug preparation (41 guides, 67.2%), staff training and/or patient education (38 guides, 62.3%), and administration (37 guides, 60.7%). No standardized informatics system was found that ensured quality management, traceability and minimization of the risks associated with these drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most of the analysed guidelines limit their recommendations to the manipulation of antineoplastics. The most frequently described activities were preparation, training, and administration. It would be convenient to apply ICTs (Information and Communications Technologies) to manage processes involving HDs in a more complete and simpler fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197172</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7a:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/317180v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Clauwaert, J.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/08/317180</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/317180v1?rss=1</link><title>DeepRibo: precise gene annotation of prokaryotes using deep learning and ribosome profiling data [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>8b6afe6d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Annotation of gene expression in prokaryotes often finds itself corrected due to small variations of the annotated gene regions observed between different (sub)-species.

We show that G9a accumulates typically at 4 to 8 cell stage to promote timely repression of a subset of 4 cell stage-specific genes.

Choosing valuable objects and rewarding actions is critical for survival. While such choices must be made in a way that suits the animal’s circumstances, the neural mechanisms underlying such context-appropriate behavior are unclear. To address this question, we devised a context-dependent reward-seeking task for macaque monkeys. Each trial started with the appearance of one of many visual scenes containing two or more objects, and the monkey had to choose the good object by saccade to get a reward. These scenes were categorized into two dimensions of emotional context: dangerous versus safe and rich versus poor. We found that many amygdala neurons were more strongly activated by dangerous scenes, by rich scenes, or by both. Furthermore, saccades to target objects occurred more quickly in dangerous than in safe scenes and were also quicker in rich than in poor scenes. Thus, amygdala neuronal activity and saccadic reaction times were negatively correlated in each monkey. These results suggest that amygdala neurons facilitate targeting saccades predictably based on aspects of emotional context, as is necessary for goal-directed and social behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UixC9bfw7t8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kazutaka Maeda, Jun Kunimatsu, Okihide Hikosaka&lt;/p&gt;

Each subunit relays excitation to PSI core through a pair of chlorophyll molecules, thus revealing previously unseen paths for energy transfer between the antennas and the PSI core.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1109?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Biochemistry, Botany</item></keywords><crawled>1528398419859</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163dba51793:6879dce:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04492-2</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Cheng Wang</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>38</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04492-2</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04492-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Whole-genome sequencing reveals genomic signatures associated with the inflammatory microenvironments in Chinese NSCLC patients</title><fingerprint>35f726a1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whole-genome sequencing reveals genomic signatures associated with the inflammatory microenvironments in Chinese NSCLC patients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-genome sequencing reveals genomic signatures associated with the inflammatory microenvironments in Chinese NSCLC patients, Published online: 24 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04492-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04492-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The distinct genomic and epidemiological features of Chinese lung cancer patients suggest the presence of alternative causal mechanisms.

Existing literature outlines the quality and location of activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during working memory (WM) tasks. However, the effects of individual differences on the underlying neural process of WM tasks are still unclear. In this functional near infrared spectroscopy study, we administered a visual and auditory n-back task to examine activation in the PFC while considering the influences of task performance, and preferred learning strategy (VARK score). While controlling for age, results indicated that high performance (HP) subjects (accuracy &gt; 90%) showed task dependent lower activation compared to normal performance subjects in PFC region Specifically HP groups showed lower activation in left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) region during performance of auditory task whereas during visual task they showed lower activation in the right DLPFC. After accounting for learning style, we found a correlation between visual and aural VARK score and level of activation in the PFC. Subjects with higher visual VARK scores displayed lower activation during auditory task in left DLPFC, while those with higher visual scores exhibited higher activation during visual task in bilateral DLPFC. During performance of auditory task, HP subjects had higher visual VARK scores compared to NP subjects indicating an effect of learning style on the task performance and activation. The results of this study show that learning style and task performance can influence PFC activation, with applications toward neurological implications of learning style and populations with deficits in auditory or visual processing.</content></content><author><name>Afrouz A.

Mesothelin is a cell surface protein that is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, liver, and pancreatic tumors. Aberrant expression of mesothelin has been shown to promote tumor progression and metastasis through interaction with established tumor biomarker CA125. Therefore, molecules that specifically bind to mesothelin have potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, no mesothelin-targeting molecules are currently approved for routine clinical use. While antibodies that target mesothelin are in development, some clinical applications may require a targeting molecule with an alternative protein fold. For example, non-antibody proteins are more suitable for molecular imaging and may facilitate diverse chemical conjugation strategies to create drug delivery complexes. In this work, we engineered variants of the fibronectin type III domain (Fn3) non-antibody protein scaffold to bind to mesothelin with high affinity, using directed evolution and yeast surface display. Lead engineered Fn3 variants were solubly produced and purified from bacterial culture at high yield. Upon specific binding to mesothelin on human cancer cell lines, the engineered Fn3 proteins internalized and co-localized to early endosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-antibody proteins engineered to bind mesothelin. The results validate that non-antibody proteins can be engineered to bind to tumor biomarker mesothelin, and encourage the continued development of engineered variants for applications such as targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.</content></content><author><name>Allison R.

For nearly 50 years, psychologists have studied prospective memory, or the ability to execute delayed intentions. Yet, there remains a gap in understanding as to whether initial encoding of the intention must be elaborative and strategic, or whether some components of successful encoding can occur in a perfunctory, transient manner. In eight studies (N = 680), we instructed participants to remember to press the &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; key if they saw words representing fruits (cue) during an ongoing lexical decision task. They then typed what they were thinking and responded whether they encoded fruits as a general category, as specific exemplars, or hardly thought about it at all. Consistent with the perfunctory view, participants often reported mind wandering (42.9%) and hardly thinking about the prospective memory task (22.5%). Even though participants were given a general category cue, many participants generated specific category exemplars (34.5%). Bayesian analyses of encoding durations indicated that specific exemplars came to mind in a perfunctory manner rather than via strategic, elaborative mechanisms. Few participants correctly guessed the research hypotheses and changing from fruit category cues to initial-letter cues eliminated reports of specific exemplar generation, thereby arguing against demand characteristics in the thought probe procedure. In a final experiment, encoding duration was unrelated to prospective memory performance; however, specific-exemplar encoders outperformed general-category encoders with no ongoing task monitoring costs. Our findings reveal substantial variability in intention encoding, and demonstrate that some components of prospective memory encoding can be done “in passing.”</content></content><author><name>Michael K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Risky sexual behaviors adversely affect the health of youth and young adults exposing them to sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS and unwanted pregnancy to females that in turn lead to deleterious health, social and economic consequences. Youth centers inform their clients on sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancy, high risk abortion, and other reproductive health problems. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the prevalence of risky sexual behaviors among youth center reproductive health clinic users and non-users in Addis Ababa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A comparative cross-sectional study design was carried out among 524 youth in Addis Ababa from March to April, 2016. The data was entered in EPI-INFO 7 software; and cleaned and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. The prevalence was computed. Binary and multivariable logistic regression was done to determine the strength, direction and significance of association between youth center reproductive health clinic utilization and risky sexual behavior and to control confounder variables respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 524 youth with the response rate of 92% participated in the study. The overall prevalence of risky sexual behavior was 226 (43.1%) (With statistically significant difference in prevalence among users 101 (38.5%) and non-users 125 (47.7%) of youth center clinics, (p-value = 0.04). The odds of reporting risky sexual behavior was 60% higher among volunteers who did not use the reproductive health clinic, relative to those who did (AOR = 1.60; 95%CI = 1.08, 2.37). Teenagers aged 15–19 years were (AOR = 0.08; 95%CI = 0.05, 0.15) 92% less likely to practice risky sexual behavior compared to those aged 25–29 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Risky sexual behavior was statistically significantly higher among non-users of the youth center reproductive health clinic compared with the users. In addition, a substantial proportion of the youth engaged in different risky sexual behaviors that are evidenced by the existence of multiple sexual partners, sexual practice without condom and early sexual debut that might predispose youth to STIs including HIV infection and unwanted pregnancy. The ministry of health and its partners should strengthen youth center reproductive health clinics in urban, semi-urban and rural parts of Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nigusie Fetene</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nigusie Fetene, Wubegzier Mekonnen&lt;/p&gt;

Cysteine proteases have long been established as valid drug targets, which can be covalently and selectively inhibited by vinyl sulfones. This computational study was initiated to identify purchasable vinyl sulfone compounds, which could possibly inhibit cryptopain1 with higher efficacy than K11777.

The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains unclear, but an imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is known to play a critical role in AD progression. A promising preventative approach is to enhance the normal Aβ clearance activity of brain phagocytes such as microglia. In mice, the intraperitoneal injection of Toll-like receptor 4 agonist was shown to enhance Aβ clearance and exhibit a preventative effect on AD-related pathology. Our previous clinical study demonstrated that orally administered &lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&lt;/i&gt;-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPSp) exhibited an LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-lowering effect in human volunteers with hyperlipidemia, a known risk factor for AD. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies have shown that LPSp treatment increases Aβ phagocytosis by microglial cells; however it is still unclear whether orally administered LPSp exhibits a preventive effect on AD progression. We show here that in senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice fed a high-fat diet, oral administration of LPSp at 0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight·day for 18 weeks significantly improved glucose metabolism and lipid profiles. The LPSp treatment also reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and oxidative-burst activity in the peripheral blood. Moreover, LPSp significantly reduced brain Aβ burden and memory impairment as seen in the water maze test, although we could not confirm a significant enhancement of Aβ phagocytosis in microglia isolated from the brains after treatment. Taken together, our results show that LPSp holds promise as a preventative therapy for AD or AD-related diseases induced by impairment of metabolic functions.</content></content><author><name>Yutaro Kobayashi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;

Infection experiments are critical for understanding wildlife disease dynamics. Although infection experiments are typically designed to reduce complexity, disease outcomes still result from complex interactions between host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Cryptic variation across factors can lead to decreased repeatability of infection experiments within and between research groups and hinder research progress. Furthermore, studies with unexpected results are often relegated to the “file drawer” and potential insights gained from these experimental outcomes are lost. Here, we report unexpected results from an infection experiment studying the response of two differentially-susceptible but related frogs (American Bullfrog &lt;i&gt;Rana catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; and the Mountain yellow-legged frog &lt;i&gt;Rana muscosa&lt;/i&gt;) to the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus (&lt;i&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/i&gt;, Bd). Despite well-documented differences in susceptibility between species, we found no evidence for antibody-mediated immune response and no Bd-related mortality in either species. Additionally, during the study, the sham-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; control group became unexpectedly Bd-positive. We used a custom genotyping assay to demonstrate that the aberrantly-infected &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; carried a Bd genotype distinct from the inoculation genotype. Thus &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; individuals were acquired with low-intensity infections that could not be detected with qPCR. In the Bd-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; treatment group, the inoculated genotype appeared to out-compete the cryptic infection. Thus, our results provide insight into Bd coinfection dynamics, a phenomenon that is increasingly relevant as different pathogen strains are moved around the globe. Our experiment highlights how unexpected experimental outcomes can serve as both cautionary tales and opportunities to explore unanswered research questions. We use our results as a case study to highlight common sources of anomalous results for infection experiments. We argue that understanding these factors will aid researchers in the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments to understand wildlife disease processes.</content></content><author><name>Allison Q.

NANOG has been demonstrated to play an essential role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, and its pseudogene, NANOGP8, is suggested to promote the cancer stem cell phenotype. As the roles of these genes are intimately involved with glioblastoma multiforme progression and exosomes are critical in intercellular communication, we conducted a detailed analysis of the association of the NANOG gene family with exosomes to identify diagnostic markers for cancer. Exosomes were precipitated from conditioned culture media from various cell lines, and NANOG gene fragments were directly amplified without DNA isolation using multiple primer sets. The use of the enzymes AlwNI and SmaI with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis functioned to distinguish NANOGP8 from other NANOG family members. Collectively, results suggest that the NANOG DNA associated with exosomes is not full length and that mixed populations of the NANOG gene family exist. Furthermore, sequence analysis of exosomal DNA amplified with a NANOGP8 specific primer set frequently showed an insertion of a 22 bp sequence into the 3’ UTR. The occurrence rate of this insertion was significantly higher in exosomal DNA clones from cancer cells as compared to normal cells. We have detected mixed populations of NANOG DNA associated with exosomes and have identified preferential modulations in the sequences from cancer samples. Our findings, coupled with the properties of exosomes, may allow for the detection of traditionally inaccessible cancers (i.e. GBM) through minimally invasive techniques. Further analysis of exosomal DNA sequences of NANOG and other embryonic stemness genes (OCT3/4, SOX2, etc.) may establish a robust collection of exosome based diagnostic markers, and further elucidate the mechanisms of cancer formation, progression, and metastasis.</content></content><author><name>Manjusha Vaidya</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Manjusha Vaidya, Michael Bacchus, Kiminobu Sugaya&lt;/p&gt;

Ellis, Kerry Kornfeld&lt;/p&gt;
Sperm activation is a fascinating example of cell differentiation, in which immotile spermatids undergo a rapid and dramatic transition to become mature, motile sperm. Because the sperm nucleus is transcriptionally silent, this transition does not involve transcriptional changes. Although &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; is a leading model for studies of sperm activation, the mechanisms by which signaling pathways induce this transformation remain poorly characterized. Here we show that a conserved transmembrane zinc transporter, ZIPT-7.1, regulates the induction of sperm activation in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; nematodes. The &lt;i&gt;zipt-7&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt; mutant hermaphrodites cannot self-fertilize, and males reproduce poorly, because mutant spermatids are defective in responding to activating signals. The &lt;i&gt;zipt-7&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt; gene is expressed in the germ line and functions in germ cells to promote sperm activation. When expressed in mammalian cells, ZIPT-7.1 mediates zinc transport with high specificity and is predominantly located on internal membranes. Finally, genetic epistasis places &lt;i&gt;zipt-7&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt; at the end of the &lt;i&gt;spe-8&lt;/i&gt; sperm activation pathway, and ZIPT-7.1 binds SPE-4, a presenilin that regulates sperm activation. Based on these results, we propose a new model for sperm activation. In spermatids, inactive ZIPT-7.1 is localized to the membranous organelles, which contain higher levels of zinc than the cytoplasm. When sperm activation is triggered, ZIPT-7.1 activity increases, releasing zinc from internal stores. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic zinc promotes the phenotypic changes characteristic of activation. Thus, zinc signaling is a key step in the signal transduction process that mediates sperm activation, and we have identified a zinc transporter that is central to this activation process.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3pYNyUReKxQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1528393441406</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanmei Zhao, Chieh-Hsiang Tan, Amber Krauchunas, Andrea Scharf, Nicholas Dietrich, Kurt Warnhoff, Zhiheng Yuan, Marina Druzhinina, Sam Guoping Gu, Long Miao, Andrew Singson, Ronald E.

Thus, zinc signaling is a key step in the signal transduction process that mediates sperm activation, and we have identified a zinc transporter that is central to this activation process.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3pYNyUReKxQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><author><name>Yanmei Zhao</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/3pYNyUReKxQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528393384581</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163db584285:4559e9:a96d255</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198220</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1527109200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527109200000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198220</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198220</link><title>Retraction: Calcium Channel Blockers and Risk of Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of 17 Observational Studies</title><fingerprint>d5a740</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>The PLOS ONE Editors</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198220</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2347:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00176</originId><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><published>1527825600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00176</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00176</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] In Depth Analysis of Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive Patch-Assisted Delivery of Memantine and Donepezil Using Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling and in Vitro/in Vivo Correlations</title><fingerprint>2b2a7323</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00176/20180601/images/medium/mp-2018-00176j_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00176&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Recent reports have revealed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to arise from cancer stem cells phenotypically similar to physiological hematopoietic stem cells. Myelodysplastic hematopoiesis maintains a hierarchical organization, but the proportion of several hematopoietic compartments is skewed and multiple surface markers are aberrantly expressed. These aberrant antigen expression patterns hold diagnostic and therapeutic promise. However, eradication of MDS requires targeting of early myelodysplasia propagating stem cells. This warrants an exact assessment of the differentiation stage at which aberrant expression occurs in transformed hematopoiesis. Here, we report results on the prospective and extensive dissection of the hematopoietic hierarchy in 20 patients with either low-risk MDS or MDS with excess blasts and compare it to hematopoiesis in patients with non-malignancy-associated cytopenia or B cell lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration. We found patients with MDS with excess blasts to exhibit characteristic expansions of specific immature progenitor compartments. We also identified the aberrant expression of several markers including ALDH, CLL-1, CD44, and CD47 to be specific features of hematopoiesis in MDS with excess blasts. We show that amongst these, aberrant CLL-1 expression manifested at the early uncommitted hematopoietic stem cell level, suggesting a potential role as a therapeutic target.</content></content><author><name>Benjamin N.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was the largest in history. Starting in September 2014, International Medical Corps (IMC) operated five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Our results highlight parameters key to designing and maintaining an ETU. High concentration chlorine solution usage was highly correlated with both daily patient occupancy and high-risk zone staff entries; low concentration chlorine usage was less well explained by these measures. There is high demand for laundering and disinfecting of personal protective equipment (PPE) on a daily basis and approximately 1 (0–4) piece of PPE is damaged each day.&lt;/p&gt; Research limitations/Implications &lt;p&gt;Lack of standardization in the type and format of data collected at ETUs made constructing the WASH/IPC database difficult.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is relatively high in the southern regions of China. Yunnan, located in southwestern China, has the highest number of ethnic groups. However, HEV infection in the ethnic population is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the seropositive rate, risk factor, and clinical impact of HEV infection in the ethnic groups of Yunnan. We recruited 1912 individuals from four minority groups in three prefectures of Yunnan province. Epidemiological records on potential risk factors for exposure to HEV and blood biochemical index were analyzed. All the serum samples were tested for anti-HEV IgM/IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the IgM-positive samples were subjected to nested reverse transcription-PCR to detect HEV RNA. Overall, 1273 individuals (66.58%) were positive for anti-HEV IgG, 16 (0.84%) for anti-HEV IgM, and 64 (3.35%) for anti-HEV IgG and IgM both; none of them had detectable HEV RNA. Multivariate analysis revealed a strong statistical association between ethnic origin and HEV IgG seroprevalence. Anti-HEV IgG reactivity in the Hani ethnic (82.3%; 401/487) population was higher than that in the Naxi (71.9%, 340/473), Bulang (65.1%; 302/464), and Wa (60.2%; 294/488) ethnic populations (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Older age and male sex were independently associated with the risk of past HEV infection. Moreover, anti-HEV IgG-positive individuals showed significantly higher levels of total and direct bilirubin and alanine amino transferase but significantly lower levels of globulin and low-density lipoprotein, than the respective levels in anti-HEV IgG-negative individuals. Thus, the seroprevalence of HEV infection is high in the ethnic populations of Yunnan, China. It is therefore necessary to increase the surveillance of specific risk groups and raise awareness about the possible infectious diseases to help limit the HEV transmission here.</content></content><author><name>Yue Feng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yue Feng, Yue-Mei Feng, Songmei Wang, Fang Xu, Xuehui Zhang, Chunyue Zhang, Yuanyuan Jia, Wanru Yang, Xueshan Xia, Jianzhong Yin&lt;/p&gt;

Ramie (&lt;i&gt;Boehmeria nivea&lt;/i&gt; L. Gaud) fiber, one of the most important natural fibers, is extracted from stem bark. Continuous cropping is the main obstacle to ramie stem growth and a major cause of reduced yields. Root-associated microbes play crucial roles in plant growth and health. In this study, we investigated differences between microbial communities in the soil of healthy and continuously cropped ramie plants, and sought to identify potential mechanisms whereby these communities could counteract the problems posed by continuous cropping. Paired-end Illumina MiSeq analysis of 16S rRNA and ITS gene amplicons was employed to study bacterial and fungal communities. Long-term monoculture of ramie significantly decreased fiber yields and altered soil microbial communities. Our findings revealed how microbial communities and functional diversity varied according to the planting year and plant health status. Soil bacterial diversity increased with the period of ramie monoculture, whereas no significant differences were observed for fungi. Sequence analyses revealed that &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acidobacteria&lt;/i&gt; were the most abundant bacterial phyla. &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; abundance decreased with the period of ramie monoculture and correlated positively with the stem length, stem diameter, and fiber yield. The &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chloroflexi&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt; phyla exhibited a significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) negative correlation with yields during continuous cultivation. Some &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt; members showed reduced microbial diversity, which prevented continuous ramie cropping. &lt;i&gt;Ascomycota&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Basidiomycota&lt;/i&gt; were the main fungal phyla. The relatively high abundance of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; observed in healthy ramie may contribute to disease suppression, thereby promoting ramie growth. In summary, soil weakness and increased disease in ramie plants after long-term continuous cropping can be attributed to changes in soil microbes, a reduction in beneficial microbes, and an accumulation of harmful microbes.</content></content><author><name>Siyuan Zhu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siyuan Zhu, Yanzhou Wang, Xiaomin Xu, Touming Liu, Duanqing Wu, Xia Zheng, Shouwei Tang, Qiuzhong Dai&lt;/p&gt;

In summary, soil weakness and increased disease in ramie plants after long-term continuous cropping can be attributed to changes in soil microbes, a reduction in beneficial microbes, and an accumulation of harmful microbes.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197095</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f74:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00047</originId><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><published>1525665600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00047</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00047</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Fluorouracil-Loaded Gold Nanoparticles for the Treatment of Skin Cancer: Development, in Vitro Characterization, and in Vivo Evaluation in a Mouse Skin Cancer Xenograft Model</title><fingerprint>a1ddf520</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00047/20180507/images/medium/mp-2018-00047a_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00047&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</content></content><author><name>Cuiying Song</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cuiying Song, Wei Guan, Jihui Ma&lt;/p&gt;

Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development. In human societies, however, there exists bias toward interacting with partners with similar characteristics, but not contributing globally. We study how complex interactive behaviors evolve under risks through proposing a threshold public goods game model. In the model, individuals either play games with participants who own the same phenotype, or contribute to the collective target of global public goods. We further introduce an insurance compensation mechanism into the model to probe the evolution of global cooperation. It is found that the introduction of the insurance remarkably promotes the emergence of global cooperative behavior and inhibits the tendency to play games only with individuals of the same phenotype. Besides, contrary to models without insurance, global cooperation is strengthened with the increase of imitation intensities. In addition, high risk and high threshold are in favor of global cooperation.</content></content><author><name>Jinming Du</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinming Du&lt;/p&gt;

Fisheries management is most effective when based on scientific estimates of sustainable fishing rates. While some simple approaches allow estimation of harvest limits, more data-intensive stock assessments are generally required to evaluate the stock’s biomass and fishing rates relative to sustainable levels. Here we evaluate how stock characteristics relate to the rate of new assessments in the United States. Using a statistical model based on time-to-event analysis and 569 coastal marine fish and invertebrate stocks landed in commercial fisheries, we quantify the impact of region, habitat, life-history, and economic factors on the annual probability of being assessed. Although the majority of landings come from assessed stocks in all regions, less than half of the regionally-landed species currently have been assessed. As expected, our time-to-event model identified landed tonnage and ex-vessel price as the dominant factors determining increased rates of new assessments. However, we also found that after controlling for landings and price, there has been a consistent bias towards assessing larger-bodied species. A number of vulnerable groups such as rockfishes (Scorpaeniformes) and groundsharks (Carcharhiniformes) have a relatively high annual probability of being assessed after controlling for their relatively small tonnage and low price. Due to relatively low landed tonnage and price of species that are currently unassessed, our model suggests that the number of assessed stocks will increase more slowly in future decades.</content></content><author><name>Philipp Neubauer</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Neubauer, James T.

Locomotor systems are widely used to study rhythmically active neural networks. These networks have to be coordinated in order to produce meaningful behavior. The crayfish swimmeret system is well suited to investigate such coordination of distributed neural oscillators because the neurons and their connectivity for generating and especially for coordinating the motor output are identified. The system maintains a fixed phase lag between the segmental oscillators, independent of cycle period. To further the understanding of the system’s plasticity for keeping the phase lag fixed, we profiled the neurotransmitters used by the Coordinating Neurons, which are necessary and sufficient for coordination of the segmental oscillators. We used a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and mass spectrometric methods. This arrangement of methods ensured that we could screen for several specific neurotransmitters, since a single method is often not suitable for all neurotransmitters of interest. In a first step, to preselect neurotransmitter candidates, we investigated the effect of substances known to be present in some swimmeret system neurons on the motor output and coordination. Subsequently, we demonstrated electrophysiologically that the identified synapse between the Coordinating Neurons and their target is mainly chemical, but neither glutamate antagonist nor γ-aminobutyric acid antagonist application affected this synapse. With immunohistochemical experiments, we provide strong evidence that the Coordinating Neurons are not serotonergic. Single-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with subsequent principal component analysis identified acetylcholine as the putative neurotransmitter for both types of Coordinating Neurons.</content></content><author><name>Anna C.

Ongoing acidification of the ocean through uptake of anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is known to affect marine biota and ecosystems with largely unknown consequences for marine food webs. Changes in food web structure have the potential to alter trophic transfer, partitioning, and biogeochemical cycling of elements in the ocean. Here we investigated the impact of realistic end-of-the-century CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations on the development and partitioning of the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica pools in a coastal pelagic ecosystem (Gullmar Fjord, Sweden). We covered the entire winter-to-summer plankton succession (100 days) in two sets of five pelagic mesocosms, with one set being CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enriched (~760 μatm &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the other one left at ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. Elemental mass balances were calculated and we highlight important challenges and uncertainties we have faced in the closed mesocosm system. Our key observations under high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were: (1) A significantly amplified transfer of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from primary producers to higher trophic levels, during times of regenerated primary production. (2) A prolonged retention of all three elements in the pelagic food web that significantly reduced nitrogen and phosphorus sedimentation by about 11 and 9%, respectively. (3) A positive trend in carbon fixation (relative to nitrogen) that appeared in the particulate matter pool as well as the downward particle flux. This excess carbon counteracted a potential reduction in carbon sedimentation that could have been expected from patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes. Our findings highlight the potential for ocean acidification to alter partitioning and cycling of carbon and nutrients in the surface ocean but also show that impacts are temporarily variable and likely depending upon the structure of the plankton food web.</content></content><author><name>Tim Boxhammer</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Boxhammer, Jan Taucher, Lennart T.

Evaluating vaccine efficacy against sporadic diseases like tularemia using field trials is problematic, and therefore alternative strategies to test vaccine candidates like the &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; Live Vaccine Strain (LVS), such as testing in animals and applying correlate measurements, are needed. Recently, we described a promising correlate strategy that predicted the degree of vaccine-induced protection in mice given parenteral challenges, primarily when using an attenuated &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; strain. Here, we demonstrate that using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in this approach predicts LVS-mediated protection against respiratory challenge of Fischer 344 rats with fully virulent &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, with exceptional sensitivity and specificity. Rats were vaccinated with a panel of LVS-derived vaccines and subsequently given lethal respiratory challenges with Type A &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;. In parallel, PBLs from vaccinated rats were evaluated for their functional ability to control intramacrophage &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; growth in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; co-culture assays. PBLs recovered from co-cultures were also evaluated for relative gene expression using a large panel of genes identified in murine studies. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; control of LVS intramacrophage replication reflected the hierarchy of protection. Further, despite variability between individuals, 22 genes were significantly more up-regulated in PBLs from rats vaccinated with LVS compared to those from rats vaccinated with the variant LVS-R or heat-killed LVS, which were poorly protective. These genes included IFN-γ, IL-21, NOS2, LTA, T-bet, IL-12rβ2, and CCL5. Most importantly, combining quantifications of intramacrophage growth control with 5–7 gene expression levels using multivariate analyses discriminated protected from non-protected individuals with greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity. The results therefore support translation of this approach to non-human primates and people to evaluate new vaccines against &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; and other intracellular pathogens.</content></content><author><name>Roberto De Pascalis</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roberto De Pascalis, Andrew Hahn, Helen M.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Epiretinal traction is not responsible only for epiretinal but also intraretinal changes. This study aims to describe structural and vascular intraretinal changes after macular peeling in idiopathic (iERM) vs diabetic ERM (dERM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001). The GFAP expression was significantly higher in dERMs (p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The intraretinal changes are different in iERMs and dERMs, as increased expression of CEIFLs in iERMs vs ICs in dERMs. The CEIFLs are associated with worse anatomical and functional outcomes in iERMs, whereas GFAP espression in peeled ILMs is higher in dERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Mario R.

One of the most ambitious endeavors in the field of diabetes technology is non-invasive glucose sensing. In the past decades, a number of different technologies have been assessed, but none of these have found its entry into general clinical use. We report on the development of a table-top confocal Raman spectrometer that was used in the home of patients with diabetes and operated for extended periods of time unsupervised and without recalibration. The system is based on measurement of glucose levels at a ‘critical depth’ in the skin, specifically in the interstitial fluid located below the stratum corneum but above the underlying adipose tissue layer. The region chosen for routine glucose measurements was the base of the thumb (the thenar). In a small clinical study, 35 patients with diabetes analyzed their interstitial fluid glucose for a period of 60 days using the new critical-depth Raman (CD-Raman) method and levels were correlated to reference capillary blood glucose values using a standard finger-stick and test strip product. The calibration of the CD-Raman system was stable for &gt; 10 days. Measurement performance for glucose levels present at, or below, a depth of ~250μm below the skin surface was comparable to that reported for currently available invasive continuous glucose monitors. In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home.</content></content><author><name>Signe M.

Citrinin (CIT) is a hepato-nephrotoxic fungal metabolite produced by the genera &lt;i&gt;Penicillium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Monascu&lt;/i&gt;. There is an increasing demand for rapid and economical methods for detection CIT residues in fruit. In this study, we developed an immunochromatographic strip (ICS) for detection of citrinin (CIT) residues in fruit for the first time. Anti-CIT monoclonal antibody (McAb) 2B9 was prepared, with a binding affinity of 9.39 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; L/moL. Conjugates CIT-BSA and McAb 2B9 were used to develop the ICS which could be completed in 5 min, with the detection limit of 50 ng/mL and no cross reactivity with other mycotoxins. Analysis of CIT in 64 fruit samples revealed that data obtained from the ICS test were in good agreement with indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ic-ELISAs) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This result demonstrated that the ICS test could be used as a rapid, reliable, cost-effective and user-friendly qualitative tool for detection of CIT residues on-site.</content></content><author><name>Haiwei Cheng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Haiwei Cheng, Yi Yang, Yifei Chen, Xueqiu Chen, Zizheng Cai, Aifang Du&lt;/p&gt;

In the 5‐step carboxylase reaction, the substrate Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP) first binds Rubisco and undergoes enolization before binding the second substrate, CO2. Hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex is followed by CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation. However, details of the roles and protonation states of active‐site residues, and sources of protons and water, remain highly speculative. Large‐scale computations on active‐site models provide a means to better understand this complex chemical mechanism. The computational protocol comprises a combination of hybrid semi‐empirical quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics within constrained molecular dynamics simulations, together with constrained gradient minimization calculations using density functional theory. Alternative pathways for hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex and associated active‐site protonation networks and proton and water sources were investigated. The main findings from analysis of the resulting energetics advocate major revision to existing mechanisms such that: hydration takes place anti to the CO2; both hydration and CC bond scission require early protonation of CO2 in the RuBP.CO2 complex; CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation reactions are concerted and, effectively, there is only one stable intermediate, the C3‐gemdiolate complex.

For drove a conclusions we compere amount of CO2 detected in DEMS during ethanol oxidation reaction and so called CO stripping experiment.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/On_the_Lack_of_Beneficial_Role_of_Rh_Towards_C-C_Bond_Cleavage_During_Low_Temperature_Ethanol_Electrooxidation_on_Pt-Rh_Nanoalloys/6281264</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526643756671</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163730f0e7f:51904b8:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019376?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Daniel Finkelstein-Shapiro</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019376?af=R</link><title>Two-dimensional Fano lineshapes: Excited-state absorption contributions</title><fingerprint>fa0d6613</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1525931992000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019376?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526282826472</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1635d8bb2e8:2d2ccc1:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5510.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Ola Bronstad Brynildsrud, Vegard Eldholm, Jon Bohlin, Kennedy Uadiale, Stephen Obaro, Dominique A.

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Sarcopenic obesity is a risk factor of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to generate a predictive score of sarcopenia occurrence one year after bariatric surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Patients and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted an observational prospective cohort study on a total of 184 severely obese patients admitted to our institution to undergo sleeve gastrectomy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebrae (SMA, cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was measured from the routinely performed computed tomography. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as follows: SMA/height&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI &amp;lt; 38.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for women and &amp;lt; 52.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for men. Measurements were performed at surgery and one year later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Most of the included patients were female (79%), with a mean age of 42±0.9 years and body mass index of 43.2±0.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia before surgery and 59 (32%) at the one-year follow-up. Male gender (p&amp;lt;0.0001), SMA before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001), and SMI before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001) significantly correlated with the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after surgery by multivariate analysis. Two predictive sarcopenia occurrence scores were constructed using SMA and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt;) or SMI and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt;). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; was significantly greater than that of the &lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt; for the diagnosis of postoperative sarcopenia occurrence (0.95±0.02 &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 0.90±0.02; p&amp;lt;0.01). A cut-off value for the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; of 0.53 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 95%. In the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia, the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; had still an excellent AUROC of 0.92±0.02. A cut-off of 0.55 predicted development of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy in these patients with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 88%, and negative predictive value of 95%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; has excellent predictive value for the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy.

Our software tool scVAE has support for several count likelihood functions and a variant of the variational auto-encoder has a priori clustering in the latent space.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318295v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526497463519</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636a56ccdf:4381133:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0175-2</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Benjamin B.

Current therapeutics for hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients such as nucleoside analogs (NAs) are effective; however, new antiviral drugs against HBV are still desired. Since the interaction between the epsilon (ε) sequence of HBV pregenomic RNA and viral polymerase (Pol) is a key step in the HBV replication cycle, we aimed to identify small compounds for its inhibition, and established a pull-down assay system for the detection of ε-RNA-binding-Pol. Screening showed that 5 out of 3,965 compounds inhibited ε-Pol binding, and we identified rosmarinic acid, which exhibited specificity, as a potential antiviral agent. In order to examine the anti-HBV effects of rosmarinic acid, HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes from a humanized mouse liver were treated with rosmarinic acid. The rosmarinic acid treatment decreased HBV components including the amounts of extracellular HBV DNA with negligible cytotoxicity. We also investigated the combined effects of rosmarinic acid and the NA, lamivudine. rosmarinic acid slightly enhanced the anti-HBV activity of lamivudine, suggesting that the HBV replication step targeted by rosmarinic acid is distinct from that of NA. We analyzed an additional 25 rosmarinic acid derivatives, and found that 5 also inhibited ε-Pol. Structural comparisons between these derivatives implied that the “two phenolic hydroxyl groups at both ends” and the “caffeic acid-like structure” of rosmarinic acid are critical for the inhibition of ε-Pol binding.

The X-ray diffraction studies revealed the formation of structures where one, two, or three of the molecules involved in the retro-Claisen condensation reaction were linked to the lanthanoid centres.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Unconventional_Lanthanoid_Complexes_Supported_by_Retro-Claisen_Condensation_Products_of_-Triketonates/6448253</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528319501622</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163d6f0e536:5f76232:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025525?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Min Li</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025525?af=R</link><title>Stark effect of Kramers-Henneberger atoms</title><fingerprint>4c6fee1b</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1526016225000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025525?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526282826472</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1635d8bb2e8:2d2ccc4:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197200</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1525726800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1525726800000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197200</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197200</link><title>Correction: Proposing a validated clinical app predicting hospitalization cost for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery</title><fingerprint>627d5dbc</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197200</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42272:5785ab88</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4975.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Ken-ichi Takayama, Takashi Suzuki, Tetsuya Fujimura, Satoru Takahashi, Satoshi Inoue</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4975</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4975.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><title>COBLL1 modulates cell morphology and facilitates androgen receptor genomic binding in advanced prostate cancer [Medical Sciences]</title><fingerprint>eb9c6460</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential for prostate cancer progression and acquiring resistance to hormone therapy.

Background &lt;p&gt;Prolonged sitting and low activity—both common in older people—are associated with increased mortality and poorer health.

At age 72 years, participants completed the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire which assesses attitudes on three domains—Psychosocial loss, Physical change and Psychological growth. At age 79 years, participants wore an activPAL activity monitor for seven days. The outcome measures were average daily time spent sedentary, number of sit-to-stand transitions, and step count.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant associations between any of the Attitude to Ageing domain scores and time spent sedentary or number of sit-to-stand transitions.

Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase which plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulation of genes involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, invasion and self-renewal. Activity and biological function of EZH2 are regulated by posttranslational modifications. It is suggested that EZH2 stability may be regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which is an enzyme catalyzing the addition of GlcNAc moieties to target proteins. In this study, we determined the impact of OGT on expression of EZH2 target genes &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt;, that are involved in breast cancer progression. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both EZH2 and OGT are targeted to the promoter regions of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; and knockdown of EZH2 or OGT affects expression of studied genes in breast non-malignant (MCF10A) and cancer cells (MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231). The results showed that OGT silencing affects EZH2 binding to &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; promoter but the effect is cell-context dependent. Despite the slight decrease in EZH2 protein level in cells with OGT depletion, EZH2 binding to &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; was increased. Moreover, OGT binding to promoter regions of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; was increased in cells with knockdown of EZH2. Increased expression of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; in cells with OGT deregulation was associated with increased acetylation level of histone H3. The results suggest that OGT is involved in regulation of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; expression but its role is not associated with regulation of EZH2 protein stability.</content></content><author><name>Ewa Forma</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ewa Forma, Paweł Jóźwiak, Piotr Ciesielski, Agnieszka Zaczek, Katarzyna Starska, Magdalena Bryś, Anna Krześlak&lt;/p&gt;

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a serious complication during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Currently, the diagnosis of CI-AKI relies on serum creatinine (SCr) that is however affected by several limitations potentially leading to delayed or missed diagnoses. In this study we examined the diagnostic accuracy of a “bedside” measurement of plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) in the early detection of CI-AKI in 97 patients undergoing elective PCI. The overall incidence of CI-AKI was 3%. A significant positive correlation was observed between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI SCr (r = 0.339, p = 0.004) and a significant negative correlation between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI CrCl (r = -0.303, p = 0.010). In patients with post-PCI SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl (median SCr absolute increase), delta NGAL 0–6 hours and 6-hours NGAL values were higher compared with patients with SCr elevation below the defined threshold (p = 0.049 and p = 0.056). The ROC analysis showed that a 6 hours NGAL value &gt; 96 ng/ml significantly predicted an absolute SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl after contrast exposure with sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 74% (AUC 0.819, 95% CI: 0.656 to 0.983, p = 0.005). The use of bedside NGAL assessment may significantly hasten diagnosis and treatment of CI-AKI, with remarkable clinical prognostic consequences.</content></content><author><name>Annunziata Nusca</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Annunziata Nusca, Marco Miglionico, Claudio Proscia, Laura Ragni, Massimiliano Carassiti, Francesca Lassandro Pepe, Germano Di Sciascio&lt;/p&gt;

To address this complexity issue, we used an annotation-free computational method to analyze and compare the AS profiles between small specific groups of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; circadian neurons. The method, the &lt;span&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;unction &lt;span&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;sage &lt;span&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;odel (JUM), allows the comprehensive profiling of both known and novel AS events from specific RNA-seq libraries. The results show that many diverse and novel pre-mRNA isoforms are preferentially expressed in one class of clock neuron and also absent from the more standard &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; head RNA preparation. These AS events are enriched in potassium channels important for neuronal firing, and there are also cycling isoforms with no detectable underlying transcriptional oscillations. The results suggest massive AS regulation in the brain that is also likely important for circadian regulation.</description><author><name>katea@brandeis.edu (Donald C Rio)</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Although alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) significantly diversifies the neuronal proteome, the extent of AS is still unknown due in part to the large number of diverse cell types in the brain. To address this complexity issue, we used an annotation-free computational method to analyze and compare the AS profiles between small specific groups of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; circadian neurons. The method, the &lt;span&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;unction &lt;span&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;sage &lt;span&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;odel (JUM), allows the comprehensive profiling of both known and novel AS events from specific RNA-seq libraries.

Missov&lt;/p&gt;
Mortality information of populations is aggregated in life tables that serve as a basis for calculation of life expectancy and various life disparity measures. Conventional life-table methods address right-censoring inadequately by assuming a constant hazard in the last open-ended age group. As a result, life expectancy can be substantially distorted, especially in the case when the last age group in a life table contains a large proportion of the population. Previous research suggests addressing censoring in a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model setting as this framework incorporates all major features of adult mortality. In this article, we quantify the difference between gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy values and those published in the largest publicly available high-quality life-table databases for human populations, drawing attention to populations for which life expectancy values should be reconsidered. We also advocate the use of gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy for three reasons. First, model-based life-expectancy calculation successfully handles the problem of data quality or availability, resulting in severe censoring due to the unification of a substantial number of deaths in the last open-end age group. Second, model-based life expectancies are preferable in the case of data scarcity, i.e. when data contain numerous age groups with zero death counts: here, we provide an example of hunter-gatherer populations. Third, gamma-Gompertz-Makeham-based life expectancy values are almost identical to the ones provided by the major high-quality human mortality databases that use more complicated procedures. Applying a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model to adult mortality data can be used to revise life-expectancy trends for historical populations that usually serve as input for mortality forecasts.</content></content><author><name>László Németh</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by László Németh, Trifon I.

Applying a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model to adult mortality data can be used to revise life-expectancy trends for historical populations that usually serve as input for mortality forecasts.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198485</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b790:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197515</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1526936400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1526936400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197515</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197515</link><title>Regulatory effects of root pruning on leaf nutrients, photosynthesis, and growth of trees in a closed-canopy poplar plantation</title><fingerprint>1eeeac98</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Da-wei Jing, Zhen-yu Du, Ming-you Wang, Qing-hua Wang, Hai-lin Ma, Fang-chun Liu, Bing-yao Ma, Yu-feng Dong&lt;/p&gt;
A plantation of 5-year-old poplar &lt;i&gt;Populus × euramericana cv&lt;/i&gt;. ‘Neva’ was used to study the regulatory effects of root pruning on nutrients, photosynthetic characteristics, and water-use efficiency (WUE) of leaves and growth rates of diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.3 m), tree height, and volume. Six root-pruning treatments were conducted with different combinations of intensity (at a distance of six, eight or ten times DBH from the trunk) and orientation (on two or four sides of the trees). Results showed that the N, P, K, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance of leaves were all significantly decreased by root pruning over the initial period following root pruning (30 days), but increased in the subsequent investigations. The values of the above indexes peaked in 8–2 treatment (i.e., eight times DBH distance on two sides). The leaf WUE in 8–2 treatment, and average growth rates of DBH, tree height and volume, were the highest among all treatments within 3 years of root pruning. The results indicated that the root pruning based on the appropriate selection of intensity and orientation had significant positive effects on leaf nutrients, photosynthesis, and growth of trees in a closed-canopy poplar plantation.</content></content><author><name>Da-wei Jing</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Da-wei Jing, Zhen-yu Du, Ming-you Wang, Qing-hua Wang, Hai-lin Ma, Fang-chun Liu, Bing-yao Ma, Yu-feng Dong&lt;/p&gt;

While previous work has shown that the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification is a useful, though subjective, feature for predicting surgical outcomes, obtaining this classification requires a clinician to review the patient&apos;s medical records. Our goal here is to create an improved risk score using electronic medical records and demonstrate its utility in predicting in-hospital mortality without requiring clinician-derived ASA scores. Methods: Data from 49,513 surgical patients were used to train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree classifiers for predicting in-hospital mortality. The features used are readily available before surgery from EMR databases. A gradient boosted tree regression model was trained to impute the ASA Physical Status Classification, and this new, imputed score was included as an additional feature to preoperatively predict in-hospital post-surgical mortality. The preoperative risk prediction was then used as an input feature to a deep neural network (DNN), along with intraoperative features, to predict postoperative in-hospital mortality risk. Performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: We found that the random forest classifier (AUC 0.921, 95%CI 0.908-0.934) outperforms logistic regression (AUC 0.871, 95%CI 0.841-0.900) and gradient boosted trees (AUC 0.897, 95%CI 0.881-0.912) in predicting in-hospital post-surgical mortality. Using logistic regression, the ASA Physical Status Classification score alone had an AUC of 0.865 (95%CI 0.848-0.882). Adding preoperative features to the ASA Physical Status Classification improved the random forest AUC to 0.929 (95%CI 0.915-0.943). Using only automatically obtained preoperative features with no clinician intervention, we found that the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.921 (95%CI 0.908-0.934). Integrating the preoperative risk prediction into the DNN for postoperative risk prediction results in an AUC of 0.924 (95%CI 0.905-0.941), and with both a preoperative and postoperative risk score for each patient, we were able to show that the mortality risk changes over time. Conclusions: Features easily extracted from EMR data can be used to preoperatively predict the risk of in-hospital post-surgical mortality in a fully automated fashion, with accuracy comparable to models trained on features that require clinical expertise. This preoperative risk score can then be compared to the postoperative risk score to show that the risk changes, and therefore should be monitored longitudinally over time.</content></content><published>1527231600000</published><description>Background: Predicting preoperative in-hospital mortality using readily-available electronic medical record (EMR) data can aid clinicians in accurately and rapidly determining surgical risk.

Fitness is determined by the ability of an organism to both survive and reproduce; however, the mechanisms that lead to increased survival may not have the same effect on reproductive success. We used nineteen natural &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; genotypes from the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Genetic Reference Panel to determine if adaptive plasticity following short-term acclimation through rapid cold-hardening (RCH) affects mating behavior and mating success. We confirmed that exposure to the acclimation temperature is beneficial to survival following cold stress; however, we found that this same acclimation temperature exposure led to less efficient male courtship and a significant decrease in the likelihood of mating. Cold tolerance and the capacity to respond plastically to cold stress were not correlated with mating behavior following acclimation, suggesting that the genetic control of the physiological effects of the cold temperature exposure likely differ between survival and behavioral responses. We also tested whether the exposure of males to the acclimation temperature influenced courtship song. This exposure again significantly increased courtship duration; however, courtship song was unchanged. These results illustrate costs of short-term acclimation on survival and reproductive components of fitness and demonstrate the pronounced effect that short-term thermal environment shifts can have on reproductive success.</content></content><author><name>Elizabeth R.

Recent studies indicate that lifestyle factors in early life affect breast cancer risk. We therefore explored the association of high consumption of meat, milk, and whole grain products in adolescence and midlife, on breast cancer risk. We used data from the population based AGES-Reykjavik cohort (2002–2006), where 3,326 women with a mean age of 77 years (SD 6.0) participated. For food items and principal component derived dietary patterns we used Cox proportional models to calculate multivariate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). During a mean follow-up of 8.8 years, 97 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. For both adolescence and midlife, daily consumption of rye bread was positively associated with breast cancer (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–2.9, respectively). In contrast, persistent high consumption of oatmeal was negatively associated with breast cancer (0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.9). No association was found for other food items or dietary patterns that included rye bread. High rye bread consumption in adolescence and midlife may increase risk of late-life breast cancer whilst persistent consumption of oatmeal may reduce the risk.</content></content><author><name>Alfheidur Haraldsdottir</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfheidur Haraldsdottir, Johanna E.

As an application example, we perform a full mutation scanning of the interface residues in the MDM2-p53 complex.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331280v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527311695341</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1639adefded:91ba9c:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/842?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527183688000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/842.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>6</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/842?rss=1</link><title>B612 plans asteroid hunt with fleet of small satellites</title><fingerprint>b6617349</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce967:3dd877af</id><author><name>Mann, A.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/842?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Astronomy</item></keywords><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33099</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527552000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33099</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33099</link><title>Metabolic interactions between dynamic bacterial subpopulations</title><fingerprint>f93caf0b</fingerprint><description>Individual microbial species are known to occupy distinct metabolic niches within multi-species communities.

Recent literature tried to understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale chromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured, high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what are the relevant factors and how they work together? Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in human. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention scores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency map.

Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in human. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention scores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency map.

Although highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) remarkably increased life expectancy of HIV positive people, the rate of novel HIV-1 infections worldwide still represent a major concern. In this context, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) approaches such as vaginal microbicide gels topically releasing antiretroviral drugs, showed to have a striking impact in limiting HIV-1 spread. Nevertheless, the co-presence of other genital infections, particularly those due to HSV-1 or 2, constitute a serious drawback that strongly limits the efficacy of PrEP approaches. For this reason, combinations of different compounds with mixed antiviral and antiretroviral activity are thoroughly investigated Here we report the synthesis and the biological evaluation of a novel series of rhodanine derivatives, which showed to inhibit both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 replication at nanomolar concentration, and were found to be active also on acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains. The compounds showed a considerable reduction of activity in presence of serum due to a high binding to serum albumin, as determined through &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; ADME evaluations. However, the most promising compound of the series maintained a considerable activity in gel formulation, with an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; comparable to that obtained for the reference drug tenofovir. Moreover, the series of compounds showed pharmacokinetic properties suitable for topical formulation, thus suggesting that the novel rhodanine derivatives could represent effective agents to be used as dual anti HIV/HSV microbicides in PrEP approaches.</content></content><author><name>Cristina Tintori</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cristina Tintori, Giulia Iovenitti, Elisa Rita Ceresola, Roberto Ferrarese, Claudio Zamperini, Annalaura Brai, Giulio Poli, Elena Dreassi, Valeria Cagno, David Lembo, Filippo Canducci, Maurizio Botta&lt;/p&gt;

Current 16S profiling methods, however, fail to provide sufficient taxonomic resolution and accuracy to adequately perform species-level associative studies for specific conditions. This is due to the amplification and sequencing of only short 16S rRNA gene regions, typically providing for only family- or genus-level taxonomy. Moreover, sequencing errors often inflate the number of taxa present. Pacific Biosciences&apos; (PacBio&apos;s) long-read technology in particular suffers from high error rates per base. Herein we present a microbiome analysis pipeline that takes advantage of PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) technology to sequence and error correct full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes, which provides high-fidelity species-level microbiome data. Results: Analysis of a mock community with 20 bacterial species demonstrated 100% specificity and sensitivity. Examination of a 250-plus species mock community demonstrated correct species-level classification of &gt;90% of taxa and relative abundances were accurately captured. The vast majority of the remaining taxa were demonstrated to be multiply, incorrectly, or incompletely classified making true resolution difficult. Using this methodology we examined the microgeographic variation present among the microbiomes of six sinonasal sites, by both swab and biopsy, from the anterior nasal cavity to the sphenoid sinus from 12 subjects undergoing trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. We found greater variation among subjects than among sites within a subject, although significant within-individual differences were also observed. Propiniobacterium acnes (recently renamed Cutibacterium acnes [1]) was the predominant species throughout, but was found at distinct relative abundances by site. Conclusions: Our microbial composition analysis pipeline for single-molecule real-time 16S rRNA gene sequencing (MCSMRT, https://github.com/jpearl01/mcsmrt) overcomes deficits of standard marker gene based microbiome analyses by using CCS of entire 16S rRNA genes to provide increased taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution. Extensions of this approach to other marker genes could help refine taxonomic assignments of microbial species and improve reference databases, as well as strengthen the specificity of associations between microbial communities and dysbiotic states.</content></content><published>1528095600000</published><description>Background: Pan-bacterial 16S rRNA microbiome surveys performed with massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies have transformed community microbiological studies.

BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1–10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1525984928890</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arturo Blazquez-Navarro, Thomas Schachtner, Ulrik Stervbo, Anett Sefrin, Maik Stein, Timm H.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Medio-lateral stability during walking turns relies on the interaction between precise weight shifts of the body and changes in base of support by regulating step width. Although older adults and clinical populations often slow down while turning in order to compensate for balance impairments, little is known about the influence of walking speed on stability during turning.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To compare medio-lateral stability between walking turns and straight walking and to investigate whether walking speed affects medio-lateral stability during turning in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Nineteen older adults walked straight or walked and turned 180° to the right and left at their comfortable speed and at a slow pace. The walking direction was visually cued before they started to walk (preplanned) or while walking straight (unplanned). As a proxy for medio-lateral stability, we calculated the absolute difference between pelvis lateral displacement and the lateral edge of the base of support during straight walking and turning.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, irrespective of turning condition, medio-lateral stability was enhanced during turning as the pelvis was further away from the boundary of the base of support resulting in a greater margin of stability compared to straight walking. Turning at a slow pace hampered medio-lateral stability as demonstrated by pelvis lateral displacement closer to the boundaries of the base of support resulting in reduced margins of stability. The reduction in stability was caused by a narrower step width during slow walking whereas pelvis lateral displacement was unaffected by turning speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In older adults, medio-lateral stability was augmented during turning compared to straight walking, whereas turning at a slow pace hampered medio-lateral stability. These findings provide insights into the postural strategies used by older adults in order to adapt to the postural challenges of turning and straight walking.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>David Conradsson</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Conradsson, Caroline Paquette, Erika Franzén&lt;/p&gt;

The evaluation of protected area networks on their capacity to preserve species distributions is a key topic in conservation biology. There are different types of protected areas, with National Parks those with highest level of protection. National Parks can be declared attending to many ecological features that include the presence of certain animal species. Here, we selected 37 vertebrate species that were highlighted as having relevant natural value for at least one of the 10 National Parks of mainland Spain. We modelled species distributions with the favourability function, and applied the Insecurity Index to detect the degree of protection of favourable areas for each species. Two metrics of Insecurity Index were defined for each species: the Insecurity Index in each of the cells, and the Overall Insecurity Index of a species. The former allows the identification of insecure areas for each species that can be used to establish spatial conservation priorities. The latter gives a value of Insecurity for each species, which we used to calculate the Representativeness of favourable areas for the species in the network. As expected, due to the limited extension of the National Park network, all species have high values of Insecurity; i.e., just a narrow proportion of their favourable areas are covered by a National Park. However, the majority of species favourable areas are well represented in the network, i.e., the percentage of favourable areas covered by the National Park network is higher than the percentage of mainland Spain covered by the network (result also supported by a randomization approach). Even if a reserve network only covers a low percentage of a country, the Overall Insecurity Index allows an objective assessment of its capacity to represent species. Beyond the results presented here, the Insecurity Index has the potential to be extrapolated to other areas and to cover a wide range of species.</content></content><author><name>Alba Estrada</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alba Estrada, Raimundo Real&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). The exact influence of ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFL thickness (RNFLT) is unknown and was analysed in a subgroup of the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Global peripapillary RNFLT was measured in 3224 eyes of 1973 subjects (49% female) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The association of age, sex, ocular, cardiovascular, morphometric, lifestyle and cognitive factors on RNFLT was analysed using Pearson correlation coefficient and fitting a linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the univariable analysis highest correlations were found for axial length (r = -0.27), spherical equivalent (r = 0.24), and glaucoma (r = -0.15) (p&amp;lt;0.0001, respectively). Other significant correlations with RNFLT were found for age, sex, intraocular pressure, systemic hypertension and systolic blood pressure, previous eye surgery, cholesterol, homocysteine, history of coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, apnoea, diabetes and alcohol intake, p&amp;lt;0.05, respectively. Body length, body weight, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, history of apoplexy, cognitive function, peripheral artery disease, tinnitus, migraine, nicotine intake, central corneal thickness, and pseudophakia were not significantly correlated with RNFLT. The regression model revealed a significant relationship between RNFLT and age in decades (p&amp;lt;0.02), spherical equivalent (p&amp;lt;0.0001), axial length (p&amp;lt;0.0001), glaucoma (p&amp;lt;0.0001), tinnitus (p = 0.04), apnoea (p = 0.047), homocysteine (p = 0.05) and alcohol intake &gt;10g/d for women and &gt;20g/d for men (p = 0.02). Glaucoma, apnoea, higher homocysteine, higher alcohol intake and higher axial length as well as age were related to decreased RNFLT while higher spherical equivalent or history for tinnitus were related to thicker RNFL.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;RNFLT is related to age, ocular parameters and lifestyle factors. Considering these parameters in normative databases could improve the evaluation of peripapillary RNFLT.

We conclude that lineage information is indispensable for understanding regulation of cellular growth.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256123v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528059641741</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163c773bf8d:47ad364:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009278?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Steffen Rieger</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009278?af=R</link><title>Density matrix study of ground state depletion towards sub-diffraction-limited spontaneous Raman scattering spectroscopy</title><fingerprint>b3e64c42</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1527573247000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009278?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527745631525</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163b4bc5525:2c9d433:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01698</originId><origin><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId></origin><published>1526270400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01698</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01698</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Design, Synthesis, and Testing of Potent, Selective Hepsin Inhibitors via Application of an Automated Closed-Loop Optimization Platform</title><fingerprint>9fd5962b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01698/20180514/images/medium/jm-2017-016982_0020.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01698&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The tumor clone frequency (TCF) in lesional skin, measured by high-throughput sequencing of the &lt;i&gt;TCRB&lt;/i&gt; gene, was an independent prognostic factor of both progression-free and overall survival in patients with CTCL and MF in particular. In early-stage patients, a TCF of &gt;25% in the skin was a stronger predictor of progression than any other established prognostic factor (stage IB versus IA, presence of plaques, high blood lactate dehydrogenase concentration, large-cell transformation, or age).

Background &lt;p&gt;Chinese parents have access to domestic and foreign vaccines for their children. Their vaccine preferences are unclear, especially given recent pharmaceutical quality scandals and widely held beliefs deriving from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This study characterized parental beliefs about the safety and effectiveness of Chinese and foreign vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In May 2014, caregivers of young children at public immunization clinics in Shanghai, China, responded to a survey on vaccine perceptions. The two outcomes (differential belief in the effectiveness and safety of foreign vs domestic vaccines) were separately regressed onto demographic predictors in multinomial logistic regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 618 caregivers, 56% thought the effectiveness of domestic and foreign vaccines were comparable; 33% thought domestic were more effective and 11% foreign. Two-thirds thought foreign and domestic vaccines had similar safety; 11% thought domestic were safer and 21% thought foreign were safer. Compared to college graduates, those with a high school education or less had greater odds of believing domestic vaccines were more effective, and also had greater odds of believing imported vaccines were safer. Greater trust in TCM was not associated with differential beliefs in the effectiveness or safety of domestic vs foreign vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although there is no evidence that foreign and domestic vaccines differ in either effectiveness or safety, less educated caregivers in China (but not those with greater trust in TCM) appear to believe such differences exist. Further exploration of the causes of these beliefs may be necessary in order to optimize vaccine communications in China.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Zhuoying Huang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhuoying Huang, Xiaodong Sun, Abram L.

However, dimensionality of imaging data, together with a great variability of nuclear shapes present challenges for 3D morphological analysis. Thus, there is a compelling need for robust 3D nuclear morphometric techniques to carry out population-wise analysis. We propose a new approach that combines modeling, analysis, and interpretation of morphometric characteristics of cell nuclei and nucleoli in 3D. We use robust surface reconstruction that allows accurate approximation of 3D object boundary. Then, we compute geometric morphological measures characterizing the form of cell nuclei and nucleoli. Using these features, we compare over 450 nuclei with about 1,000 nucleoli of epithelial and mesenchymal prostate cancer cells, as well as 1,000 nuclei with over 2,000 nucleoli from serum-starved and proliferating fibroblast cells. Classification of sets of 9 and 15 cells achieves accuracy of 95.4% and 98%, respectively, for prostate cancer cells, and 95% and 98% for fibroblast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine these methods for 3D nuclear shape modeling and morphometry into a highly parallel pipeline workflow for morphometric analysis of thousands of nuclei and nucleoli in 3D.</content></content><published>1526454000000</published><description>Quantitative analysis of morphological changes in a cell nucleus is important for understanding of nuclear architecture and their relationship with pathological conditions such as cancer.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Mobile Health (mHealth) programs have increasingly been used to tackle maternal and child health problems in low and middle income countries. However, few studies have evaluated how these programs have been perceived by intended users and beneficiaries. Therefore, we explored perceptions of healthcare officials and beneficiaries regarding RapidSMS Rwanda, an mHealth system used by Community Health Workers (CHWs) that was scaled up nationwide in 2013.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders, providers, and beneficiaries of maternal and child health services at both the national and community levels. Semi-structured interviews were used to assess perceptions about the impact of and challenges facing the RapidSMS system. Interviews and focus group discussions were recorded (with the exception of one), transcribed verbatim, and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We conducted a total of 28 in-depth interviews and 10 focus group discussions (93 total participants). A majority of respondents believed that RapidSMS contributed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. RapidSMS was generally accepted by both CHWs and parents. Participants identified insufficient training, a lack of equipment, and low CHW motivation as the main challenges facing RapidSMS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that an mHealth program can be well accepted by both policymakers, health providers, and the community. We also found significant technical challenges that have likely reduced its impact. Addressing these challenges will serve to strengthen future mHealth programs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Angele Musabyimana</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angele Musabyimana, Hinda Ruton, Erick Gaju, Atakilt Berhe, Karen A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is frequently used to administer health-related surveys and experiments at a low cost, but little is known about its representativeness with regards to health status and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional survey comprised of questions from the nationally-representative 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was administered to 591 MTurk workers and 393 masters in 2016. Health status (asthma, depression, BMI, and general health), health behaviors (influenza vaccination, health insurance, smoking, and physical activity), and demographic characteristics of the two MTurk populations (workers and masters) were compared to each other and, using Poisson regression, to a nationally-representative BRFSS and NHANES samples.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Workers and master demographics were similar. MTurk users were more likely to be aged under 50 years compared to the national sample (86% vs. 55%) and more likely to complete a college degree than the national sample (50% vs. 26%). Adjusting for covariates, MTurk users were less likely to be vaccinated for influenza, to smoke, to have asthma, to self-report being in excellent or very good health, to exercise, and have health insurance but over twice as likely to screen positive for depression relative to a national sample. Results were fairly consistent among different age groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MTurk workers are not a generalizable population with regards to health status and behaviors; deviations did not follow a trend.

Appropriate health-related uses for MTurk and ways to improve upon the generalizability of MTurk health studies are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198835</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b31b:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0168-1</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Jamie Hicks</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0168-1</link><unread>True</unread><title>Publisher Correction: Synthesis, structure and reaction chemistry of a nucleophilic aluminyl anion</title><fingerprint>fcf577e0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Synthesis, structure and reaction chemistry of a nucleophilic aluminyl anion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Synthesis, structure and reaction chemistry of a nucleophilic aluminyl anion, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0168-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0168-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Synthesis, structure and reaction chemistry of a nucleophilic aluminyl anion</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Synthesis, structure and reaction chemistry of a nucleophilic aluminyl anion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Synthesis, structure and reaction chemistry of a nucleophilic aluminyl anion, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0168-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0168-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Synthesis, structure and reaction chemistry of a nucleophilic aluminyl anion</content></content><published>1528095600000</published><engagementRate>0.01</engagementRate><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0168-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163cb58272e:4d97fe2:2835af05</id><crawled>1528124942126</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197325</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1525986000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1525986000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197325</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197325</link><title>Observing vegetation phenology through social media</title><fingerprint>1de2ece1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sam J.

The widespread use of social media has created a valuable but underused source of data for the environmental sciences. We demonstrate the potential for images posted to the website Twitter to capture variability in vegetation phenology across United States National Parks. We process a subset of images posted to Twitter within eight U.S. National Parks, with the aim of understanding the amount of green vegetation in each image. Analysis of the relative greenness of the images show statistically significant seasonal cycles across most National Parks at the 95% confidence level, consistent with springtime green-up and fall senescence. Additionally, these social media-derived greenness indices correlate with monthly mean satellite NDVI (r = 0.62), reinforcing the potential value these data could provide in constraining models and observing regions with limited high quality scientific monitoring.</content></content><author><name>Sam J.

In long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most studied types of neural plasticity, synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to stimulation. Although a number of different proteins have been implicated in the sub-cellular molecular processes underlying induction and maintenance of LTP, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A particular challenge is to demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans. Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one involving the atypical protein kinase PKMζ and its messenger RNA, the other involving PKMζ and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate that robust bistability–stable equilibria both in the synapse’s potentiated and unpotentiated states–can arise from a set of simple molecular reactions. The model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation and the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_PVuKNJRBs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527615723856</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Helfer, Thomas R.

Consistent with the view that disgust might be involved in persistent body dissatisfaction, there is preliminary evidence showing a positive correlation between measures of negative body image and indices of both trait disgust and self-directed disgust. In two correlational studies among undergraduates (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 577 and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 346, respectively) we aimed at replicating and extending these findings by testing a series of critical relationships, which follow from our hypotheses that 1) trait disgust propensity would increase the risk of developing a negative body image by increasing the likelihood of feeling self-disgust, and 2) trait disgust sensitivity would heighten the impact of self-disgust on the development of persistent negative body appraisals. Replicating previous research, both studies showed that negative body image was positively related to self-disgust, disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. Mediation analyses showed that, in line with our model, self-disgust partly accounted for the association between disgust propensity and negative body image. Although disgust sensitivity showed an independent relationship with body image, disgust sensitivity did not moderate the association between self-disgust and negative body image. All in all, findings are consistent with the view that self-disgust-induced avoidance may contribute to persistent negative body appraisals.</content></content><author><name>Paula von Spreckelsen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paula von Spreckelsen, Klaske A.

All in all, findings are consistent with the view that self-disgust-induced avoidance may contribute to persistent negative body appraisals.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198532</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd0:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04358-7</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Atharva Sahasrabudhe</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>158</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04358-7</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04358-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Value added transformation of ubiquitous substrates into highly efficient and flexible electrodes for water splitting</title><fingerprint>b1fce375</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Value added transformation of ubiquitous substrates into highly efficient and flexible electrodes for water splitting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value added transformation of ubiquitous substrates into highly efficient and flexible electrodes for water splitting, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04358-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04358-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Water electrolysis provides a means to convert water into carbon-neutral fuels, but current devices are typically heavy, inflexible, or require costly substrates.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response.

Background &lt;p&gt;No evidence-based therapy exists for non-arteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO). Retinal ischemic tolerance is low; irreversible damage occurs within four hours of experimental NA-CRAO. In previous randomized trials evaluating intra-arterial or intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in NA-CRAO, only one patient was treated this early. In December 2013, the Departments of Neurology &amp;amp; Stroke and Ophthalmology at University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany, decided to treat patients using IVT within 4.5 hours of NA-CRAO, the therapeutic window established for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive NA-CRAO patients with severe visual loss received IVT after exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up was conducted at day 5 (d5) and day 30 (d30). Visual outcomes were compared to the conservative standard treatment (CST) arm of the EAGLE-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Until August 2016, 20 patients received IVT within 4.5 hours after NA-CRAO with a median onset-to-treatment time of 210 minutes (IQR 120–240). Visual acuity improved from baseline mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 2.46±0.33 (SD) (light perception) to 1.52±1.09 (Snellen equivalent: 6/200) at d5 (p = 0.002) and 1.60±1.08 (Snellen equivalent: 6/240) at d30. Compared to the EAGLE CST-arm, functional recovery to reading ability occurred more frequently after IVT: 6/20 (30%) versus 1/39 (3%) at d5 (p = 0.005) and at d30 5/20 (25%) versus 2/37 (5%) (p = 0.045). Two patients experienced serious adverse events (one angioedema and one bleeding from an abdominal aortic aneurysm) but recovered without sequelae.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IVT within 4.5 hours after symptom onset may represent an effective treatment of NA-CRAO.

The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women). Two other trajectories showed a more pronounced decline. Smoking and the presence of respiratory complaints were the best predictors of a trajectory with stronger decline. A greater BMI over the follow-up period was associated with a more unfavorable FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; course both in men (β = -0.027 (SD = 0.002); P &amp;lt; 0.001) and in women (β = -0.008 (SD = 0.001); P &amp;lt; 0.001). Smokers at baseline who quit the habit during follow-up, showed smaller decline in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison to persistent smokers, independent of BMI change (In men β = -0.074 (SD = 0.020); P &amp;lt; 0.001.

The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women). Two other trajectories showed a more pronounced decline. Smoking and the presence of respiratory complaints were the best predictors of a trajectory with stronger decline. A greater BMI over the follow-up period was associated with a more unfavorable FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; course both in men (β = -0.027 (SD = 0.002); P &amp;lt; 0.001) and in women (β = -0.008 (SD = 0.001); P &amp;lt; 0.001). Smokers at baseline who quit the habit during follow-up, showed smaller decline in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison to persistent smokers, independent of BMI change (In men β = -0.074 (SD = 0.020); P &amp;lt; 0.001. In women β = -0.277 (SD = 0.068); P &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, three typical trajectories of age-related FEV1 decline could be distinguished. Change in the lifestyle related risk factors, BMI and smoking, significantly impact aging-related decline of lung function. Identifying deviant trajectories may help in early recognition of those at risk of a diagnosis of lung disease later in life.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197250</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7ad:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197799</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1526590800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1526590800000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197799</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197799</link><title>Correction: Lung density change after SABR: A comparative study between tri-Co-60 magnetic resonance-guided system and linear accelerator</title><fingerprint>71d91d9e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eunji Kim, Hong-Gyun Wu, Jong Min Park, Jung-in Kim, Hak Jae Kim, Hyun-Cheol Kang&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Eunji Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eunji Kim, Hong-Gyun Wu, Jong Min Park, Jung-in Kim, Hak Jae Kim, Hyun-Cheol Kang&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197799</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8544b:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26936-x</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Anne Zemella</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26936-x</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26936-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Cell-free protein synthesis as a novel tool for directed glycoengineering of active erythropoietin</title><fingerprint>4a89b1e2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cell-free protein synthesis as a novel tool for directed glycoengineering of active erythropoietin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell-free protein synthesis as a novel tool for directed glycoengineering of active erythropoietin, Published online: 04 June 2018;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common urologic malignancies and it is urgently needed to identify novel potential prognostic biomarkers for predicting prognosis and progression of patients with BC in clinical practice. Previous research has revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played critical roles in BC, and may serve as novel potential prognostic biomarkers in patients with BC. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the prognostic potential of lncRNAs in BC patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). According to the predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 9 recently published articles comprising 13 lncRNAs and 666 BC patients were included into this meta-analysis. We analyzed the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the relationship between lncRNAs expression and survival outcomes. We also analyzed the odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the association between lncRNAs expression and clinicopathological characteristics, including histological grade, gender, multifocality, tumor size, and tumor stage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that high lncRNAs expression was associated with shorter overall survival in Asian BC patients (pooled HR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.35–4.00, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, random-effect). High lncRNAs expression levels were significantly associated with histological grade (G2-G3 vs. G1: OR = 3.857, 95%CI: 1.293–11.502, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015, random-effect).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In summary, this meta-analysis has demonstrated that lncRNAs could be used as potential prognostic markers for BC and high lncRNAs expression could predict poor prognosis among Asian BC patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yuexin Xia</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuexin Xia, Zhiyuan Liu, Weijian Yu, Shihang Zhou, Linnan Shao, Wenqian Song, Ming Liu&lt;/p&gt;

We also analyzed the odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the association between lncRNAs expression and clinicopathological characteristics, including histological grade, gender, multifocality, tumor size, and tumor stage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that high lncRNAs expression was associated with shorter overall survival in Asian BC patients (pooled HR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.35–4.00, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, random-effect). High lncRNAs expression levels were significantly associated with histological grade (G2-G3 vs. G1: OR = 3.857, 95%CI: 1.293–11.502, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015, random-effect).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In summary, this meta-analysis has demonstrated that lncRNAs could be used as potential prognostic markers for BC and high lncRNAs expression could predict poor prognosis among Asian BC patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198602</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd3:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00041</originId><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><published>1527134400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00041</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00041</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] New Flavone-Cyanoacetamide Hybrids with a Combination of Cholinergic, Antioxidant, Modulation of ß-Amyloid Aggregation, and Neuroprotection Properties as Innovative Multifunctional Therapeutic Candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease and Unraveling Their Mechanism of Action with Acetylcholinesterase</title><fingerprint>c86636bb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00041/20180524/images/medium/mp-2018-00041e_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00041&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Limited information is available on influenza virus sequence drift between transmission events. In countries with high HIV burdens, like South Africa, the direct and indirect effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events may be of public health concern. To this end, we measured hemagglutinin sequence diversity between influenza transmission events using data and specimens from a study investigating household transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses in 2 peri-urban communities in South Africa during the 2013 influenza season. Thirty index cases and 107 of 110 eligible household contacts were enrolled into the study, 47% (14/30) demonstrating intra-household laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission. In this study 35 partial hemagglutinin gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing from 11 index cases (sampled at enrolment only) and 16 secondary cases (8 cases sampled at 1 and 8 cases sampled at 2 time-points). Viral sequence identities confirmed matched influenza transmission pairs within the 11 households with corresponding sequenced index and secondary cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 different influenza viral lineages in the 14 households. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains were shown to be genetically distinct between the 2 communities (from distinct geographic regions), which was not observed for the influenza A(H3N2) strains. Intra-host/intra-household influenza A(H3N2) sequence drift was identified in 2 households. The first was a synonymous mutation between the index case and a household contact, and the second a non-synonymous mutation between 2 serial samples taken at days 0 and 4 post enrolment from an HIV-infected secondary case. Limited inter-household sequence diversity was observed as highlighted by sharing of the same influenza strain between different households within each community. The limited intra-household sequence drift is in line with previous studies also using Sanger sequencing, corroborating the presence of strict selective bottlenecks that limit sequence variance. We were not able to directly ascertain the effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events.</content></content><author><name>Ziyaad Valley-Omar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ziyaad Valley-Omar, Preetha Iyengar, Claire von Mollendorf, Stefano Tempia, Alexandra Moerdyk, Orienka Hellferscee, Neil Martinson, Meredith McMorrow, Ebrahim Variava, Katlego Masonoke, Adam L.
