Background &lt;p&gt;With the greatest burden of infant undernutrition and morbidity in low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a need for suitable approaches to monitor infants in a simple, low-cost and effective manner. Anthropometry continues to play a major role in characterising growth and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a range of models to aid in identifying neonates at risk of malnutrition. We first adopted a logistic regression approach to screen for a composite neonatal morbidity, low and high body fat (BF%) infants. We then developed linear regression models for the estimation of neonatal fat mass as an assessment of body composition and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We fitted logistic regression models combining up to four anthropometric variables to predict composite morbidity and low and high BF% neonates. The greatest area under receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUC with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) for identifying composite morbidity was 0.740 (0.63, 0.85), resulting from the combination of birthweight, length, chest and mid-thigh circumferences. The AUCs (95% CI) for identifying low and high BF% were 0.827 (0.78, 0.88) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88), respectively.For identifying composite morbidity, BF% as measured via air displacement plethysmography showed strong predictive ability (AUC 0.786 (0.70, 0.88)), while birthweight percentiles had a lower AUC (0.695 (0.57, 0.82)). Birthweight percentiles could also identify low and high BF% neonates with AUCs of 0.792 (0.74, 0.85) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88). We applied a sex-specific approach to anthropometric estimation of neonatal fat mass, demonstrating the influence of the testing sample size on the final model performance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These models display potential for further development and evaluation in LMICs to detect infants in need of further nutritional management, especially where traditional methods of risk management such as birthweight for gestational age percentiles may be variable or non-existent, or unable to detect appropriately grown, low fat newborns.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Jacqueline Huvanandana</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195193</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c56:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>a54b841f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jacqueline Huvanandana, Angela E.

Whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects mental functions, and how any such effects arise from its neural effects, continue to be debated. We investigated whether tDCS applied over the visual cortex (Oz) with a vertex (Cz) reference might affect response times (RTs) in a visual search task. We also examined whether any significant tDCS effects would interact with task factors (target presence, discrimination difficulty, and stimulus brightness) that are known to selectively influence one or the other of the two information processing stages posited by current models of visual search. Based on additive factor logic, we expected that the pattern of interactions involving a significant tDCS effect could help us colocalize the tDCS effect to one (or both) of the processing stages. In Experiment 1 (n = 12), anodal tDCS improved RTs significantly; cathodal tDCS produced a nonsignificant trend toward improvement. However, there were no interactions between the anodal tDCS effect and target presence or discrimination difficulty. In Experiment 2 (n = 18), we manipulated stimulus brightness along with target presence and discrimination difficulty. Anodal and cathodal tDCS both produced significant improvements in RTs. Again, the tDCS effects did not interact with any of the task factors. In Experiment 3 (n = 16), electrodes were placed at Cz and on the upper arm, to test for a possible effect of incidental stimulation of the motor regions under Cz. No effect of tDCS on RTs was found. These findings strengthen the case for tDCS having real effects on cerebral information processing. However, these effects did not clearly arise from either of the two processing stages of the visual search process. We suggest that this is because tDCS has a DIFFUSE, pervasive action across the task-relevant neuroanatomical region(s), not a discrete effect in terms of information processing stages.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Kyongje Sung</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194640</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37b8:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>ccb4010c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kyongje Sung, Barry Gordon&lt;/p&gt;

Violent acts on university campuses are becoming more frequent. Enrollment rates of Latinos at universities is increasing. Research has indicated that youths are more susceptible to trauma, particularly Latinos. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate the validity of commonly used posttraumatic stress measures among Latino college students. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is one of the most commonly used metrics of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. However, it is largely unknown if the IES-R is measuring the same construct across different sub-samples (e.g. Latino versus non-Latino). The current study aimed to assess measurement invariance for the IES-R between Latino and non-Latino participants. A total of 545 participants completed the IES-R. One- and three-factor scoring solutions were compared using confirmatory factor analyses. Measurement invariance was then evaluated by estimating several multiple-group confirmatory factor analytic models. Four models with an increasing degree of invariance across groups were compared. A significant χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; difference test was used to indicate a significant change in model fit between nested models within the measurement invariance testing process. The three-factor scoring solution could not be used for the measurement invariance process because the subscale correlations were too high for estimation (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;s 0.92–1.00). Therefore, the one-factor model was used for the invariance testing process. Invariance was met for each level of invariance: configural, metric, scalar, and strict. All measurement invariance testing results indicated that the one-factor solution for the IES-R was equivalent for the Latino and non-Latino participants.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Jitske Tiemensma</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195229</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5d:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>fc68bb5d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jitske Tiemensma, Sarah Depaoli, Sonja D.

In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of repeated brain metastases (BM) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS2) following local failure of a prior radiosurgical procedure (SRS1). Between December 1996 and August 2015, 30 patients with 36 BM underwent SRS2 with a median dose of 18Gy. All BM were located outside critical structures. Following SRS2, local control at 6 months and one year were respectively 82.9% (IC 95%: 67.6–91.9) and 67.8% (IC 95%: 51–81). On multivariate analysis, planning target volume (PTV) &amp;lt; 3cc (HR: 0.19 (0.1–0.52)) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) prior to SRS2 (HR: 0.25 (0.1–0.64)) were significantly associated with a better local control. One- and two-year overall survival rates after SRS2 were respectively 65.5% (IC 95%: 47.3–80%) and 27.6% (IC 95%: 14.7–45.7). Median overall survival following SRS2 was 14.2 months (range 1–106). Nineteen (63%) patients died from progressive systemic disease. Three (10%) patients died from out-field progressive brain disease and 8 (27%) in-field. Concerning toxicities, edema, radionecrosis, and hemorrhages were identified in 5 (12.8%), 4 (10.2%), and 5 (12.8%) patients respectively. No toxicity resulted in a neurological deficit. On univariate analysis, toxicities were significantly associated with PTV &gt; 7cc (p = 0.02) and all patients had a WBRT before SRS2. A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases showed encouraging rates of local control. This treatment led to acceptable toxicities, especially for brain metastases smaller than 7cc, in our selected cohort of patients with BM located outside critical structures. Further studies are needed.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Juliette Moreau</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195608</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d745:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>eb5b022d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juliette Moreau, Toufic Khalil, Guillaume Dupic, Emmanuel Chautard, Jean-Jacques Lemaire, Florian Magnier, Véronique Dedieu, Michel Lapeyre, Pierre Verrelle, Julian Biau&lt;/p&gt;

Following the indication of the World Health Organization, a national plan for the elimination of measles was approved in Italy and this included the improvement of the molecular surveillance of measles viruses and the interruption of indigenous transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, large outbreaks continue to occur in almost all regions of the country, including Sicily. Here we describe the epidemiology and molecular dynamics of measles viruses as a result of the measles surveillance activity carried out by the “Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella” in Sicily over a 5-year period. Biological samples of 259 suspected measles cases were tested for viral RNA detection and a total of 223 (86.1%) were classified as laboratory confirmed. The median age of confirmed measles cases was 21.0 years and about half of them were adults aged 19 years and older. Overall, one-third of the patients showed clinical complications and these latter were more common among adults than children (44.9% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 25.7%). The vast majority of measles cases were unvaccinated (94.2%, n = 210). The phylogenetic analysis of 221 measles virus nucleotide sequences revealed sporadic detections of genotypes D4 and H1, while endemic circulation of genotypes D8 and B3 was documented. Genotype D8 was associated with epidemics occurred between 2013 and 2016, whereas genotype B3 was more recently introduced into Sicily characterizing the current measles outbreak. The results of this study confirm the autochthonous co-circulation of viral variants belonging to different genotypes during the study period, and emphasizes the need of measles surveillance programmes in order to investigate the viral dynamics, the pathways of disease transmission, and to eventually adapt the development of successfull vaccine formulations.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Fabio Tramuto</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195256</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f6:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>b8c64933</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Tramuto, Carmelo Massimo Maida, Fanny Pojero, Giuseppina Maria Elena Colomba, Alessandra Casuccio, Vincenzo Restivo, Francesco Vitale&lt;/p&gt;

Medulloblastoma (MB), the tumor of the cerebellum, is the most frequent brain cancer in childhood and a major cause of pediatric mortality. Based on gene profiling, four MB subgroups have been identified, i.e., Wnt or Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) types, and subgroup 3 or 4. The Shh-type MB has been shown to arise from the cerebellar precursors of granule neurons (GCPs), where a hyperactivation of the Shh pathway leads to their neoplastic transformation. We have previously shown that the gene &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PC3&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Btg2&lt;/i&gt;) inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation and migration of GCPs. Moreover, the overexpression or the deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, a model of spontaneous Shh-type MB, highly reduces or increases, respectively, the frequency of MB. Here we tested whether Tis21 can inhibit MB allografts. Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously grafted with MB cells explanted from &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. MB allografts were then injected with adeno-associated viruses either carrying &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;) or empty (AAV-CBA). We observed that the treatment with AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; significantly inhibited the growth of tumor nodules, as judged by their volume, and reduced the number of proliferating tumor cells (labeled with Ki67 or BrdU), relative to AAV-CBA-treated control mice. In parallel, AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; increased significantly tumor cells labeled with early and late neural differentiation markers. Overall the results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;-gene therapy slows down MB tumor growth through inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neural differentiation. These results validate &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; as a relevant target for MB therapy.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Dario Presutti</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194206</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cfa09:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>610466c5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dario Presutti, Manuela Ceccarelli, Laura Micheli, Giuliana Papoff, Simonetta Santini, Simone Samperna, Cristiana Lalli, Lorena Zentilin, Giovina Ruberti, Felice Tirone&lt;/p&gt;

Tristan da Cunha Islands, an archipelago of four rocky volcanic islands situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and part of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), present a rare example of a relatively unimpacted temperate marine ecosystem. We conducted the first quantitative surveys of nearshore kelp forests, offshore pelagic waters and deep sea habitats. Kelp forests had very low biodiversity and species richness, but high biomass and abundance of those species present. Spatial variation in assemblage structure for both nearshore fish and invertebrates/algae was greatest between the three northern islands and the southern island of Gough, where sea temperatures were on average 3-4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; colder. Despite a lobster fishery that provides the bulk of the income to the Tristan islands, lobster abundance and biomass are comparable to or greater than many Marine Protected Areas in other parts of the world. Pelagic camera surveys documented a rich biodiversity offshore, including large numbers of juvenile blue sharks, &lt;i&gt;Prionace glauca&lt;/i&gt;.

Tristan da Cunha Islands, an archipelago of four rocky volcanic islands situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and part of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), present a rare example of a relatively unimpacted temperate marine ecosystem. We conducted the first quantitative surveys of nearshore kelp forests, offshore pelagic waters and deep sea habitats. Kelp forests had very low biodiversity and species richness, but high biomass and abundance of those species present. Spatial variation in assemblage structure for both nearshore fish and invertebrates/algae was greatest between the three northern islands and the southern island of Gough, where sea temperatures were on average 3-4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; colder. Despite a lobster fishery that provides the bulk of the income to the Tristan islands, lobster abundance and biomass are comparable to or greater than many Marine Protected Areas in other parts of the world. Pelagic camera surveys documented a rich biodiversity offshore, including large numbers of juvenile blue sharks, &lt;i&gt;Prionace glauca&lt;/i&gt;. Species richness and abundance in the deep sea is positively related to hard rocky substrate and biogenic habitats such as sea pens, crinoids, whip corals, and gorgonians were present at 40% of the deep camera deployments. We observed distinct differences in the deep fish community above and below ~750 m depth. Concurrent oceanographic sampling showed a discontinuity in temperature and salinity at this depth. While currently healthy, Tristan’s marine ecosystem is not without potential threats: shipping traffic leading to wrecks and species introductions, pressure to increase fishing effort beyond sustainable levels and the impacts of climate change all could potentially increase in the coming years.

Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical features of postoperative delirium are similar to the core features of alpha synuclein-related cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which precede the cardinal motor features of PD, are likely to be risk factors for developing postoperative delirium. We investigated the association between PD-related NMSs and postoperative delirium in old people undergoing elective spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective study. Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis. We assessed eight easily-assessed and representative PD-related NMSs 1 day before the scheduled surgery using tests or questionnaires for each symptom. The presence of delirium was determined by using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Fifteen (14.4%) of the 104 participants (age, 71.7 ± 4.7 years; men, 34.6%) met the CAM criteria for post-operative delirium. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that decreased olfactory function (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.44–0.91) and exhibiting rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD, OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09–1.93) were significantly independent predictors of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study shows that hyposmia and RBD are significantly independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in general elderly population. Considering that NMSs may represent burden of alpha synuclein deposit, we postulate that an underlying alpha synucleinopathy may correlates with postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Significance &lt;p&gt;This study gives a novel insight for the risk factor of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Ki Hoon Kim</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195749</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a3:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>217a9dd7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ki Hoon Kim, Suk Yun Kang, Dong Ah Shin, Seong Yi, Yoon Ha, Keung Nyun Kim, Young Ho Sohn, Phil Hyu Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Our previous research demonstrated that tilianin protects the myocardium in a myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) rat model and has prominent pharmacological potential as a cardiovascular drug. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular signaling implicated in the improvement of myocardial survival induced by tilianin, a flavonoid antioxidant. Tilianin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/d) or saline was orally administered to rats for 14 days. On the 15th day, ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 45 min, followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The levels of MIRI-induced serum myocardial enzymes and cardiomyocyte apoptosis as well as infarct size were examined to assess the cardioprotective effects. Cardiac tissues were collected for western blot analyses to determine the protein expression of anti-apoptotic signaling molecules. In MIRI-treated rats, our results revealed that pre-administration of high dose-tilianin the reduced release of LDH, MDA, and CK-MB and increased the plasma SOD level, and significantly attenuated the infarct size. Western blot analysis showed that a remarkable rise in expression of Bcl-2 and XIAP, and decline in expression of Bax, Smac/Diablo, HtrA2/Omi, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 was observed in the myocardium. The apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes further supports the cardioprotective effect of tilianin. Additionally, compared with the MIRI model group, pretreatment with high dose-tilianin group upregulated phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In contrast, using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block Akt activation effectively inhibited the protective effects of tilianin against MIRI. Tilianin pretreatment was beneficial for activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting myocardial apoptosis.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Cheng Zeng</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193845</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9fa:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>b672c86a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng Zeng, Wen Jiang, Ruifang Zheng, Chenghui He, Jianguang Li, Jianguo Xing&lt;/p&gt;

Nitrogen stress is an important control on the growth of phytoplankton and varying responses to this common condition among taxa may affect their relative success within phytoplankton communities. We analyzed photosynthetic responses to nitrogen (N) stress in two classes of phytoplankton that often dominate their respective size ranges, diatoms and prasinophytes, selecting species of distinct niches within each class. Changes in photosynthetic structures appeared similar within each class during N stress, but photophysiological and growth responses were more species- or niche-specific. In the coastal diatom &lt;i&gt;Thalassiosira pseudonana&lt;/i&gt; and the oceanic diatom &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;weissflogii&lt;/i&gt;, N starvation induced large declines in photosynthetic pigments and Photosystem II (PSII) quantity and activity as well as increases in the effective absorption cross-section of PSII photochemistry (&lt;i&gt;σʹ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;PSII&lt;/sub&gt;). These diatoms also increased photoprotection through energy-dependent non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) during N starvation. Resupply of N in diatoms caused rapid recovery of growth and relaxation of NPQ, while recovery of PSII photochemistry was slower. In contrast, the prasinophytes &lt;i&gt;Micromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp., an Arctic Ocean species, and &lt;i&gt;Ostreococcus tauri&lt;/i&gt;, a temperate coastal eutrophile, showed little change in photosynthetic pigments and structures and a decline or no change, respectively, in &lt;i&gt;σʹ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;PSII&lt;/sub&gt; with N starvation. Growth and PSII function recovered quickly in &lt;i&gt;Micromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. after resupply of N while &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tauri&lt;/i&gt; failed to recover N-replete levels of electron transfer from PSII and growth, possibly due to their distinct photoprotective strategies. &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tauri&lt;/i&gt; induced energy-dependent NPQ for photoprotection that may suit its variable and nutrient-rich habitat. &lt;i&gt;Micromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. relies upon both energy-dependent NPQ and a sustained, energy-independent NPQ mechanism. A strategy in &lt;i&gt;Micromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. that permits photoprotection with little change in photosynthetic structures is consistent with its Arctic niche, where low temperatures and thus low biosynthetic rates create higher opportunity costs to rebuild photosynthetic structures.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Justin D.

A strategy in &lt;i&gt;Micromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. that permits photoprotection with little change in photosynthetic structures is consistent with its Arctic niche, where low temperatures and thus low biosynthetic rates create higher opportunity costs to rebuild photosynthetic structures.</description><published>1523480400000</published><title>Nitrogen starvation induces distinct photosynthetic responses and recovery dynamics in diatoms and prasinophytes</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-p?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-p?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-p?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522345097000</published><author><name>Alderton, G.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1480.16.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c72:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><fingerprint>dbc3c5b6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Neuro-immune cell cross-talk</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01593</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>222</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01593/20180406/images/medium/jm-2017-01593c_0015.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01593</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/wcrtEFWcXM4/acs.jmedchem.7b01593</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522987200000</published><author><name>Andreas Sellmer, Hubert Stangl, Mandy Beyer, Elisabeth Grünstein, Michel Leonhardt, Herwig Pongratz, Emerich Eichhorn, Sigurd Elz, Birgit Striegl, Zsuzsa Jenei-Lanzl, Stefan Dove, Rainer H.

The &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquito is the principal vector of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. These arboviruses are transmitted during adult female mosquito bloodfeeding. While these viruses must transverse the midgut to replicate, the blood meal must also reach the midgut to be digested, absorbed, or excreted, as aggregation of blood meal metabolites can be toxic to the female mosquito midgut. The midgut peritrophic matrix (PM), a semipermeable extracellular layer comprised of chitin fibrils, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, is one such mechanism of protection for the mosquito midgut. However, this structure has not been characterized for adult female &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. We conducted a mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis to identify proteins that comprise or are associated with the adult female &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; early midgut PM. Altogether, 474 unique proteins were identified, with 115 predicted as secreted.

Biosecurity is defined as the implementation of measures that reduce the risk of disease agents being introduced and/or spread. For pig production, several of these measures are routinely implemented (e.g. cleaning, disinfection, segregation). However, air as a potential vector of pathogens has long been disregarded. Filters for incoming and recirculating air were installed into an already existing ventilation plant at a fattening piggery (3,840 pigs at maximum) in Saxony, Germany. Over a period of three consecutive fattening periods, we evaluated various parameters including air quality indices, environmental and operating parameters, and pig performance. Animal data regarding respiratory diseases, presence of antibodies against influenza A viruses, PRRSV, and &lt;i&gt;Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and lung health score at slaughter were recorded, additionally. There were no significant differences (p = 0.824) in total bacterial counts between barns with and without air filtration. Recirculating air filtration resulted in the lowest total dust concentration (0.12 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and lung health was best in animals from the barn equipped with recirculating air filtration modules. However, there was no difference in animal performance. Antibodies against all above mentioned pathogens were detected but mostly animals were already antibody-positive at re-stocking. We demonstrated that supply air filtration as well as recirculating air filtration technique can easily be implemented in an already existing ventilation system and that recirculating air filtration resulted in enhanced lung health compared to supply air-filtered and non-filtered barns.

For pig production, several of these measures are routinely implemented (e.g. cleaning, disinfection, segregation). However, air as a potential vector of pathogens has long been disregarded. Filters for incoming and recirculating air were installed into an already existing ventilation plant at a fattening piggery (3,840 pigs at maximum) in Saxony, Germany. Over a period of three consecutive fattening periods, we evaluated various parameters including air quality indices, environmental and operating parameters, and pig performance. Animal data regarding respiratory diseases, presence of antibodies against influenza A viruses, PRRSV, and &lt;i&gt;Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and lung health score at slaughter were recorded, additionally. There were no significant differences (p = 0.824) in total bacterial counts between barns with and without air filtration. Recirculating air filtration resulted in the lowest total dust concentration (0.12 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and lung health was best in animals from the barn equipped with recirculating air filtration modules. However, there was no difference in animal performance. Antibodies against all above mentioned pathogens were detected but mostly animals were already antibody-positive at re-stocking. We demonstrated that supply air filtration as well as recirculating air filtration technique can easily be implemented in an already existing ventilation system and that recirculating air filtration resulted in enhanced lung health compared to supply air-filtered and non-filtered barns. A more prominent effect might have been obtained in a breeding facility because of the longer life span of sows and a higher biosecurity level with air filtration as an add-on measure.</description><published>1521579600000</published><title>Impact of different supply air and recirculating air filtration systems on stable climate, animal health, and performance of fattening pigs in a commercial pig farm</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006042</originId><author><name>Yered Pita-Juárez</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/C39wpIQO--A/article</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yered Pita-Juárez, Gabriel Altschuler, Sokratis Kariotis, Wenbin Wei, Katjuša Koler, Claire Green, Rudolph E.

A goal of genomics is to understand the relationships between biological processes. Pathways contribute to functional interplay within biological processes through complex but poorly understood interactions. However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships.

Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Guillaume Lhermie</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b9:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>97dca45</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Lhermie, Loren William Tauer, Yrjo Tapio Gröhn&lt;/p&gt;

Transcriptional programs determining cellular identity are preserved by epigenetically-acting chromatin factors. Although such regulators are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, it is not well understood how an abnormal epigenetic condition contributes to tumor onset. In this work, we investigated the gene signature of tumors caused by disruption of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; epigenetic regulator, &lt;i&gt;polyhomeotic (ph).&lt;/i&gt; In larval tissue &lt;i&gt;ph&lt;/i&gt; mutant cells show a shift towards an embryonic-like signature. Using loss- and gain-of-function experiments we uncovered the embryonic transcription factor &lt;i&gt;knirps (kni)&lt;/i&gt; as a new oncogene. The oncogenic potential of &lt;i&gt;kni&lt;/i&gt; lies in its ability to activate JAK/STAT signaling and block differentiation. Conversely, tumor growth in &lt;i&gt;ph&lt;/i&gt; mutant cells can be substantially reduced by overexpressing a differentiation factor. This demonstrates that epigenetically derailed tumor conditions can be reversed when targeting key players in the transcriptional network.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Tumor initiation is often linked to a loss of cellular identity. Transcriptional programs determining cellular identity are preserved by epigenetically-acting chromatin factors. Although such regulators are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, it is not well understood how an abnormal epigenetic condition contributes to tumor onset. In this work, we investigated the gene signature of tumors caused by disruption of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; epigenetic regulator, &lt;i&gt;polyhomeotic (ph).&lt;/i&gt; In larval tissue &lt;i&gt;ph&lt;/i&gt; mutant cells show a shift towards an embryonic-like signature. Using loss- and gain-of-function experiments we uncovered the embryonic transcription factor &lt;i&gt;knirps (kni)&lt;/i&gt; as a new oncogene. The oncogenic potential of &lt;i&gt;kni&lt;/i&gt; lies in its ability to activate JAK/STAT signaling and block differentiation. Conversely, tumor growth in &lt;i&gt;ph&lt;/i&gt; mutant cells can be substantially reduced by overexpressing a differentiation factor. This demonstrates that epigenetically derailed tumor conditions can be reversed when targeting key players in the transcriptional network.</content></summary><title>A switch in transcription and cell fate governs the onset of an epigenetically-deregulated tumor in Drosophila</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195901</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195901</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195901</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunyoung Baek, Minsu Cho, Seok Kim, Hee Hwang, Minseok Song, Sooyoung Yoo&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;The length of stay (LOS) is an important indicator of the efficiency of hospital management. Reduction in the number of inpatient days results in decreased risk of infection and medication side effects, improvement in the quality of treatment, and increased hospital profit with more efficient bed management. The purpose of this study was to determine which factors are associated with length of hospital stay, based on electronic health records, in order to manage hospital stay more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Research subjects were retrieved from a database of patients admitted to a tertiary general university hospital in South Korea between January and December 2013. Patients were analyzed according to the following three categories: descriptive and exploratory analysis, process pattern analysis using process mining techniques, and statistical analysis and prediction of LOS.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 55% (25,228) of inpatients were discharged within 4 days. The department of rehabilitation medicine (RH) had the highest average LOS at 15.9 days. Of all the conditions diagnosed over 250 times, diagnoses of I63.8 (cerebral infarction, middle cerebral artery), I63.9 (infarction of middle cerebral artery territory) and I21.9 (myocardial infarction) were associated with the longest average hospital stay and high standard deviation. Patients with these conditions were also more likely to be transferred to the RH department for rehabilitation. A range of variables, such as transfer, discharge delay time, operation frequency, frequency of diagnosis, severity, bed grade, and insurance type was significantly correlated with the LOS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Accurate understanding of the factors associating with the LOS and progressive improvements in processing and monitoring may allow more efficient management of the LOS of inpatients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Hyunyoung Baek</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793637:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>70d5d0de</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunyoung Baek, Minsu Cho, Seok Kim, Hee Hwang, Minseok Song, Sooyoung Yoo&lt;/p&gt;

The general question by what mechanism an “effector” molecule and the hemes of hemoglobin interact over widely separated intramolecular distances to change the oxygen affinity has been extensively investigated, and still has remained of central interest. In the present work we were interested in clarifying the general role of the protein matrix and its dynamics in the regulation of human adult hemoglobin (HbA). We used a spectroscopy approach that yields the compressibility (&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;) of the protein matrix around the hemes of the subunits in HbA and studied how the binding of heterotropic allosteric effectors modify this parameter. &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; is directly related to the variance of volume fluctuation, therefore it characterizes the molecular dynamics of the protein structure. For the experiments the heme groups either in the α or in the β subunits of HbA were replaced by fluorescent Zn-protoporphyrinIX, and series of fluorescence line narrowed spectra were measured at varied pressures. The evaluation of the spectra yielded the compressibility that showed significant dynamic asymmetry between the subunits: &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunit was 0.17±0.05/GPa, while for the β subunit it was much higher, 0.36±0.07/GPa. The heterotropic effectors, chloride ions, inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate did not cause significant changes in &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunits, while in the β subunits the effectors lead to a significant reduction down to 0.15±0.04/GPa. We relate our results to structural data, to results of recent functional studies and to those of molecular dynamics simulations, and find good agreements. The observed asymmetry in the flexibility suggests a distinct role of the subunits in the regulation of Hb that results in the observed changes of the oxygen binding capability.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Gusztáv Schay</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194994</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>2b113486</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gusztáv Schay, András D.

Compensatory growth (CG), an accelerated growth phenomenon which occurs following a period of dietary restriction is utilised worldwide in animal production systems as a management practise to lower feed costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of jejunal epithelial to CG in cattle through transcriptional profiling following a period of dietary restriction as well as subsequent re-alimentation induced CG. Sixty Holstein Friesian bulls were separated into two groups; RES and ADLIB, with 30 animals in each. RES animals were offered a restricted diet for 125 days (Period 1) followed by &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; feeding for 55 days (Period 2). ADLIB animals had &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; access to feed across both periods 1 and 2. At the end of each period, 15 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered, jejunal epithelium collected and RNAseq analysis performed. Animals that were previously diet restricted underwent CG, gaining 1.8 times the rate of their non-restricted counterparts.

Compensatory growth (CG), an accelerated growth phenomenon which occurs following a period of dietary restriction is utilised worldwide in animal production systems as a management practise to lower feed costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of jejunal epithelial to CG in cattle through transcriptional profiling following a period of dietary restriction as well as subsequent re-alimentation induced CG. Sixty Holstein Friesian bulls were separated into two groups; RES and ADLIB, with 30 animals in each. RES animals were offered a restricted diet for 125 days (Period 1) followed by &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; feeding for 55 days (Period 2). ADLIB animals had &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; access to feed across both periods 1 and 2. At the end of each period, 15 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered, jejunal epithelium collected and RNAseq analysis performed. Animals that were previously diet restricted underwent CG, gaining 1.8 times the rate of their non-restricted counterparts. Twenty-four genes were differentially expressed in RES compared to ADLIB animals at the end of Period 1, with only one gene, &lt;i&gt;GSTA1&lt;/i&gt;, differentially expressed between the two groups at the end of Period 2. When analysed within treatment (RES, Period 2 v Period 1), 31 genes were differentially expressed between diet restricted and animals undergoing CG. Dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation were associated with altered expression of genes involved in digestion and metabolism as well as those involved in cellular division and growth. Compensatory growth was also associated with greater expression of genes involved in cellular protection and detoxification in jejunal epithelium. This study highlights some of the molecular mechanisms regulating the response to dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation induced CG in cattle; however the gene expression results suggest that most of the CG in jejunal epithelium had occurred by day 55 of re-alimentation.</description><published>1521493200000</published><title>Effect of dietary restriction and subsequent re-alimentation on the transcriptional profile of bovine jejunal epithelium</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/153?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/153?rss=1</link><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523554635000</published><author><name>Lussier, A.

The structure and function of clinical dosage insulin and its analogues were assessed. This included ‘native insulins’ (human recombinant, bovine, porcine), ‘fast-acting analogues’ (aspart, glulisine, lispro) and ‘slow-acting analogues’ (glargine, detemir, degludec). Analytical ultracentrifugation, both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments, were employed to yield distributions of both molar mass and sedimentation coefficient of all nine insulins. Size exclusion chromatography, coupled to multi-angle light scattering, was also used to explore the function of these analogues. On ultracentrifugation analysis, the insulins under investigation were found to be in numerous conformational states, however the majority of insulins were present in a primarily hexameric conformation. This was true for all native insulins and two fast-acting analogues. However, glargine was present as a dimer, detemir was a multi-hexameric system, degludec was a dodecamer (di-hexamer) and glulisine was present as a dimer-hexamer-dihexamer system. However, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the two hexameric fast-acting analogues (aspart and lispro) dissociated into monomers and dimers due to the lack of zinc in the mobile phase. This comprehensive study is the first time all nine insulins have been characterised in this way, the first time that insulin detemir have been studied using analytical ultracentrifugation and the first time that insulins aspart and glulisine have been studied using sedimentation equilibrium. The structure and function of these clinically administered insulins is of critical importance and this research adds novel data to an otherwise complex functional physiological protein.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Gary G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about 11% of Tuberculosis (TB) cases occur in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and it is the leading cause of death in this population. An important step towards reducing the incidence and mortality of TB in PLHIV is to reduce the time from onset of symptoms to treatment. Factors related to TB treatment delay therefore need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with TB at the National Institute of Infectious Disease, at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil we conducted a survival analysis to identify factors associated with patient and health care treatment delay. In our analysis we included patients who were co-infected with TB and HIV (n = 201). Patients were followed during the course of their TB treatment and information regarding duration of symptoms, sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were collected at the baseline visit.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median time from onset of initial symptoms to prescription of TB treatment (total delay) was 82 days. From initiation of symptoms to first visit at INI clinic (patient delay), the median was 51 days. From first visit to initiation of treatment (health care delay) the median was 16 days. Illiteracy was associated with greater patient delay [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.25, CI 95% 1.29–3.94]. Having had a previous episode of TB (HR = 0.53, CI 95% 0.37–0.74) and being married (HR = 0.71, CI 95% 0.54–0.94) were inversely related to patient delay. Illiteracy was also associated with greater health care delay (HR = 2.83, CI 95% 1.25–5.47) in contrast to high viral load (HR = 0.37, CI 95% 0.24–0.54) and weight loss greater than 10% (HR = 0.54, CI 95% 0.37–0.8), both of which were inversely related to health care delay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study highlights the existence of factors that lead to greater risk of delayed treatment of TB among patients co-infected with HIV and TB. These include factors that can be assessed through targeted interventions which have implications for improving treatment outcomes and, through reduced duration of infectiousness, reduce the incidence of TB in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Betânia M.

There has been an increasing realisation that young infants are exposed to elevated concentrations of the carcinogen inorganic arsenic, relative to adults. This is because many infant food products are rice based, and rice is ~10-fold elevated in inorganic arsenic compared to most other foods. The European Commission (EC) has acted on this concern setting stricter standards for infants, 100 μg of inorganic arsenic per kg of food (100 μg/kg), as compared to adults (200 μg/kg), for rice based foods, a law that was brought into place in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2016. Here we investigate how this law has impacted on inorganic arsenic in baby food products in the UK market, and compare the findings to previous baby food surveys taken before and just after the law came into place. We find that for a wide range of UK infant products that the new regulations are being adhered to, with all samples surveyed, being under 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic. The prevalence of pure rice products had decreased in the UK, and there appears to be careful sourcing of the rice used in these products to ensure conformity with regulations. There has been an increased presence of mixed cereal products, with rice and maize as the main ingredient, appearing on the UK market, with varying rice contents for infant porridges, cakes and mueslis, with the latter being a relatively innovative product for infant foods. There was a highly significant correlation (P&amp;lt;0.0001) between rice content and inorganic arsenic concentration across all infant foods. When UK infant rice cakes, breakfast cereals and porridges were compare to their general, i.e. not labelled specifically for being for infant consumption, equivalent it was found that the adult foods generally exceeded the 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic standard for infant foods. Thus, infants should not be given rice products not specifically labelled as being for them if a lower inorganic arsenic diet is to be maintained.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Manus Carey</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194700</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849f5:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>749d790c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Manus Carey, Emily Donaldson, Antonio J.

Thus, infants should not be given rice products not specifically labelled as being for them if a lower inorganic arsenic diet is to be maintained.</description><published>1521234000000</published><title>Dilution of rice with other gluten free grains to lower inorganic arsenic in foods for young children in response to European Union regulations provides impetus to setting stricter standards</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23383-6</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23383-6</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/p7RvXJzmwhQ/s41598-018-23383-6</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Distinctive Clinical Effects of Haemorrhagic Markers in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Distinctive Clinical Effects of Haemorrhagic Markers in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23383-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23383-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Distinctive Clinical Effects of Haemorrhagic Markers in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/p7RvXJzmwhQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Young Kyoung Jang</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23383-6</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16247a328d1:34adfd2:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521620297937</crawled><fingerprint>b237df63</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Distinctive Clinical Effects of Haemorrhagic Markers in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Distinctive Clinical Effects of Haemorrhagic Markers in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23383-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23383-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Distinctive Clinical Effects of Haemorrhagic Markers in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/p7RvXJzmwhQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1521615600000</published><title>Author Correction: Distinctive Clinical Effects of Haemorrhagic Markers in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011643?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011643?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011643?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522988922000</published><author><name>T.

Reporter virus is a versatile tool to visualize and to analyze virus infections. However, for flaviviruses, it is difficult to maintain the inserted reporter genes on the viral genome, limiting its use in several studies that require homogeneous virus particles and several rounds of virus replication. Here, we showed that flanking inserted GFP genes on both sides with ribosome-skipping 2A sequences improved the stability and the consistency of their fluorescent signals for dengue-virus-serotype 2 (DENV2) reporter viruses. The reporter viruses can infect known susceptible mammalian cell lines and primary CD14+ human monocytes. This design can accommodate several fluorescent protein genes, enabling the generation of multi-color DENV2-16681 reporter viruses with comparable replication capabilities, as demonstrated by their abilities to maintain their fluorescent intensities during co-infections and to exclude superinfections regardless of the fluorescent tags.

Background &lt;p&gt;Knowledge of tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes is substantially needed to assess the performance of national TB controls programs (NTPs). To date, the overall estimates of treatment outcomes have not been determined in Ethiopia. Therefore, this meta-analysis was undertaken to produce pooled estimates of TB treatment outcomes and to analyze the impact of prior anti-TB drug exposure and HIV co-infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Potentially relevant studies were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE online databases. The unpublished studies have been retrieved from the grey literature through Google and Google Scholar. The pooled estimates were calculated using random effect model. The summary estimates were also presented using Forest plots and Tables. The outcome measures were successful and unsuccessful treatment outcomes. Patients who were cured or with completed treatment defined as successful treatment outcome and patients meeting the definition of death, defaulting and failure are considered as unsuccessfully treated cases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 34 studies are included for meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of successful TB treatment outcomes amounts to 83.7% (95% CI 81.1%–86.3%). Of successfully treated cases, 33.9% were cured and the remaining completed cases. Besides, among patients with unsuccessful treatment outcome, nearly 50% were dead and the rest were treatment failures and defaulters. Sub-group analysis shows that high treatment success rate was estimated in Afar; 88.9% (95% CI 83.8%–94.2%), followed by Oromia; 88.5% (95% CI 82.6%–94.5%) and Gambella; 86.1% (95% CI 84.4%–87.9%), whereas relatively poor treatment outcome was noted in Tigray; 20.0% (95% CI 2.1%–37.9%) and Amhara; 19.0% (95% CI 12.6%–25.5%). The unsuccessful TB treatment outcome was found to be higher among HIV/TB co-infected cases with an odds ratio of 1.98 (95%CI, 1.56–2.52) and re-treated cases with an odds ratio of 2.17 (95%CI, 1.55–3.03). The time trend was assessed from 2003 to 2016, but it shows insignificant variation with treatment outcome (P = 0.108).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The rate of successful treatment outcome in Ethiopia appears generally high, only slightly below the threshold suggested by the World Health Organization.

Compared with clopidogrel-naïve patients, chronic clopidogrel therapy patients were more likely to demonstrate clopidogrel poor responsiveness (66% versus 38%, p = 0.02), to be diabetic (52% versus 33%, p = 0.1) and to have multi-vessel coronary disease (79% versus 55%, p = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients sustaining acute coronary syndrome despite chronic clopidogrel therapy are more likely to exhibit inadequate platelet inhibition with clopidogrel.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523048400000</published><title>Acute myocardial infarction occurring while on chronic clopidogrel therapy (‘clopidogrel failure’) is associated with high incidence of clopidogrel poor responsiveness and stent thrombosis</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194069</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194069</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194069</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiu-Ting Yu, Yi-Fei Xu, Yan-Feng Huang, Chang Qu, Lie-Qiang Xu, Zi-Ren Su, Hui-Fang Zeng, Lin Zheng, Tie-Gang Yi, Hui-Lin Li, Jian-Ping Chen, Xiao-Jun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing disease without satisfactory treatments, in which intestinal inflammation and disrupted intestinal epithelial barrier are two main pathogeneses triggering UC. Berberrubine (BB) is deemed as one of the major active metabolite of berberine (BBR), a naturally-occurring isoquinoline alkaloid with appreciable anti-UC effect. This study aimed to comparatively investigate the therapeutic effects of BB and BBR on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse colitis model, and explore the potential underlying mechanism. Results revealed that BB (20 mg/kg) produced a comparable therapeutic effect as BBR (50 mg/kg) and positive control sulfasalazine (200 mg/kg) by significantly reducing the disease activity index (DAI) with prolonged colon length and increased bodyweight as compared with the DSS group. BB treatment was shown to significantly ameliorate the DSS-induced colonic pathological alternations and decreased histological scores. In addition, BB markedly attenuated colonic inflammation by alleviating inflammatory cell infiltration and inhibiting myeloperoxidase (MPO) and cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-10) productions in DSS mice. Furthermore, BB treatment substantially upregulated the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (zonula occludens-1, zonula occludens-2, claudin-1, occludin) and mRNA expression of mucins (mucin-1 and mucin-2), and decreased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In summary, BB exerted similar effect to its analogue BBR and positive control in attenuating DSS-induced UC with much lower dosage and similar mechanism. The protective effect observed may be intimately associated with maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and mitigating intestinal inflammation, which were mediated at least partially, via favorable modulation of TJ proteins and mucins and inhibition of inflammatory mediators productions in the colonic tissue. This is the first report to demonstrate that BB possesses pronounced anti-UC effect similar to BBR and sulfasalazine with much smaller dosage. BB might have the potential to be further developed into a promising therapeutic option in the treatment of UC.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Xiu-Ting Yu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194069</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cfa00:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>1fecfdc3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiu-Ting Yu, Yi-Fei Xu, Yan-Feng Huang, Chang Qu, Lie-Qiang Xu, Zi-Ren Su, Hui-Fang Zeng, Lin Zheng, Tie-Gang Yi, Hui-Lin Li, Jian-Ping Chen, Xiao-Jun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Sinkholes are a well-known geologic hazard but their past occurrence, useful for subsidence risk prediction, is difficult to define, especially for ancient historic times. Consequently, our knowledge about Holocene carbonate landscapes is often limited. A multidisciplinary study of Trieste Karst (Italy), close to early Roman military fortifications, led to the identification of possible ancient road tracks, cut by at least one sinkhole. Electrical Resistivity Tomography through the sinkhole has suggested the presence of a cave below its bottom, possibly responsible of the sinkhole formation, while Ground Penetrating Radar has detected no tectonic disturbances underneath the tracks. Additionally, archaeological surveys led to the discovery of over 200 Roman shoe hobnails within or close to the investigated route. According to these data, the tracks are interpreted as the remains of a main Roman road, whose itinerary has been reconstructed for more than 4 km together with other elements of ancient landscape. Our results provide the first known evidence of a Roman main road swallowed by sinkholes and suggest that Holocene karst landscapes could be much different from what previously believed.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1—transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, without and with NF-κB activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging.

Core clock transcription factors bind to the genome at enhancer sequences to regulate circadian gene expression, but not all binding sites are equally functional. We found that in mice, circadian gene expression in the liver is controlled by rhythmic chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Rev-erbα, a core repressive transcription factor of the clock, opposes functional loop formation between Rev-erbα–regulated enhancers and circadian target gene promoters by recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 co-repressor complex, histone deacetylation, and eviction of the elongation factor BRD4 and the looping factor MED1.

Core clock transcription factors bind to the genome at enhancer sequences to regulate circadian gene expression, but not all binding sites are equally functional. We found that in mice, circadian gene expression in the liver is controlled by rhythmic chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Rev-erbα, a core repressive transcription factor of the clock, opposes functional loop formation between Rev-erbα–regulated enhancers and circadian target gene promoters by recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 co-repressor complex, histone deacetylation, and eviction of the elongation factor BRD4 and the looping factor MED1.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over motor cortex and trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) modulate corticospinal circuits in healthy and injured subjects. However, their associated effects with physical exercise is still not defined. This study aimed to investigate the effect of three different settings of rTMS and tsDCS combined with treadmill exercise on spinal cord and cortical excitability of healthy subjects. We performed a triple blind, randomized, sham-controlled crossover study with 12 healthy volunteers who underwent single sessions of rTMS (1Hz, 20Hz and Sham) and tsDCS (anodal, cathodal and Sham) associated with 20 minutes of treadmill walking. Cortical excitability was assessed by motor evoked potential (MEP) and spinal cord excitability by the Hoffmann reflex (Hr), nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) and homosynaptic depression (HD). All measures were assessed before, immediately, 30 and 60 minutes after the experimental procedures. Our results demonstrated that anodal tsDCS/treadmill exercise reduced MEP’s amplitude and NFR’s area compared to sham condition, conversely, cathodal tsDCS/treadmill exercise increased NFR’s area. High-frequency rTMS increased MEP’s amplitude and NFR’s area compared to sham condition. Anodal tsDCS/treadmill exercise and 20Hz rTMS/treadmill exercise reduced Hr amplitude up to 30 minutes after stimulation offset and no changes were observed in HD measures. We demonstrated that tsDCS and rTMS combined with treadmill exercise modulated cortical and spinal cord excitability through different mechanisms. tsDCS modulated spinal reflexes in a polarity-dependent way acting at local spinal circuits while rTMS probably promoted changes in the presynaptic inhibition of spinal motoneurons. In addition, the association of two neuromodulatory techniques induced long-lasting changes.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Plínio Luna Albuquerque</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195276</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde32:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>13421fb0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Plínio Luna Albuquerque, Mayara Campêlo, Thyciane Mendonça, Luís Augusto Mendes Fontes, Rodrigo de Mattos Brito, Katia Monte-Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Data are lacking on the risk and impact of a serious hemorrhage on the prognosis after ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aimed to estimate the incidence of serious hemorrhage, analyze the impact on mortality, and identify predictors of hemorrhage after discharge from IS or TIA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;All patients admitted to Östersund Hospital for an IS or TIA in 2010–2013 were included (n = 1528, mean age: 75.1 years). Serious hemorrhages were identified until 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2015. Incidence rates were calculated. The impact on mortality (stratified by functional level) was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Non-parametric estimation under the assumption of competing risk was performed to assess the cumulative incidence and predictors of serious hemorrhages.The incidence rates of serious (n = 113) and intracranial hemorrhages (n = 45) after discharge from IS and TIA were 2.48% and 0.96% per year at risk, respectively. Patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 3–5 exhibited 58.9% mortality during follow-up and those with mRS scores of 0–2 exhibited 18.4% mortality. A serious hemorrhage did not affect mortality in patients with impaired functional status, but it increased the risk of death in patients with mRS scores of 0–2. Hypertension was associated with increased risk of serious hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found that, after discharge from an IS or TIA, serious hemorrhages were fairly common. Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability.

The electrical conductivity was not enhanced by intentional doping, and thin films of this material showed high optical transparency.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521740379000</published><title>A nonconjugated radical polymer glass with high electrical conductivity</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3481.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3481.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3481.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Much of gene regulation is carried out by proteins that bind DNA or RNA molecules at specific sequences.

Background &lt;p&gt;Carriers of mutations in hereditary cancer predisposition genes represent a small but clinically important subgroup of oncology patients. The identification of causal germline mutations determines follow-up management, treatment options and genetic counselling in patients’ families. Targeted next-generation sequencing-based analyses using cancer-specific panels in high-risk individuals have been rapidly adopted by diagnostic laboratories. While the use of diagnosis-specific panels is straightforward in typical cases, individuals with unusual phenotypes from families with overlapping criteria require multiple panel testing. Moreover, narrow gene panels are limited by our currently incomplete knowledge about possible genetic dispositions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We have designed a multi-gene panel called CZECANCA (CZEch CAncer paNel for Clinical Application) for a sequencing analysis of 219 cancer-susceptibility and candidate predisposition genes associated with frequent hereditary cancers.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The bioanalytical and bioinformatics pipeline was validated on a set of internal and commercially available DNA controls showing high coverage uniformity, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

Type IIB topoisomerases and their homologs support both archaeal/plant viability and meiotic recombination. Topo VI, a prototypical type IIB topoisomerase, comprises two Top6A and two Top6B protomers; how these subunits cooperate to engage two DNA segments and link ATP turnover to DNA transport is poorly understood. Using multiple biochemical approaches, we show that Top6B, which harbors the ATPase activity of topo VI, recognizes and exploits the DNA crossings present in supercoiled DNA to stimulate subunit dimerization by ATP. Top6B self-association in turn induces extensive DNA bending, which is needed to support duplex cleavage by Top6A. Our observations explain how topo VI tightly coordinates DNA crossover recognition and ATP binding with strand scission, providing useful insights into the operation of type IIB topoisomerases and related meiotic recombination and GHKL ATPase machineries.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Type II topoisomerases manage DNA supercoiling and aid chromosome segregation using a complex, ATP-dependent duplex strand passage mechanism.

The human gut microbiome contributes to a broad range of biochemical and metabolic functions that directly or indirectly affect human physiology. Several recent studies have indicated that factors like age, geographical location, genetic makeup, and individual health status significantly influence the diversity, stability, and resilience of the gut microbiome. Of the mentioned factors, geographical location (and related dietary/socio-economic context) appears to explain a significant portion of microbiome variation observed in various previously conducted base-line studies on human gut microbiome. Given this context, we have undertaken a microbiome study with the objective of cataloguing the taxonomic diversity of gut microbiomes sampled from an urban cohort from Ahmedabad city in Western India. Computational analysis of microbiome sequence data corresponding to 160 stool samples (collected from 80 healthy individuals at two time-points, 60 days apart) has indicated a &lt;i&gt;Prevotella&lt;/i&gt;-dominated microbial community. Given that the typical diet of participants included carbohydrate and fibre-rich components (predominantly whole grains and legume-based preparations), results appear to validate the proposed correlation between diet/geography and microbiome composition. Comparative analysis of obtained gut microbiome profiles with previously published microbiome profiles from US, China, Finland, and Japan additionally reveals a distinct taxonomic and (inferred) functional niche for the sampled microbiomes.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Disha Tandon</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195643</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd087:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>5aaf8c7b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Disha Tandon, Mohammed Monzoorul Haque, Saravanan R., Shafiq Shaikh, Sriram P., Ashok Kumar Dubey, Sharmila S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Levothyroxine replacement treatment in hypothyroidism is unable to restore physiological thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations in serum and tissues completely. Normal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations reflect only pituitary euthyroidism and, therefore, novel biomarkers representing tissue-specific thyroid state are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding regulatory RNAs, exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns and can be detectable in serum. Previous studies have demonstrated differential expression of (precursors of) miRNAs in tissues under the influence of thyroid hormone.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study if serum miRNA profiles are changed in different thyroid states.&lt;/p&gt; Design and methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 13 athyroid patients (6 males) during TSH suppressive therapy and after 4 weeks of thyroid hormone withdrawal. A magnetic bead capture system was used to isolate 384 defined miRNAs from serum. Subsequently, the TaqMan Array Card 3.0 platform was used for profiling after individual target amplification.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of the subjects was 44.0 years (range 20–61 years). Median TSH levels were 88.9 mU/l during levothyroxine withdrawal and 0.006 mU/l during LT4 treatment with a median dosage of 2.1 μg/kg. After normalization to allow inter-sample analysis, a paired analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in expression of any of the 384 miRNAs analyzed on and off LT4 treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although we previously showed an up-regulation of pri-miRNAs 133b and 206 in hypothyroid state in skeletal muscle, the present study does not supply evidence that thyroid state also affects serum miRNAs in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Elske T.

Background &lt;p&gt;Heavy burden of child injuries and lack of policy response in Ethiopia call for an improved understanding of the situation and development of action plans from multiple governmental agencies and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A consortium of international and Ethiopian researchers and stakeholders used extensive literature review and mixed analytical methods to estimate and project the burden of fatal and non-fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2030. Estimates were derived for children aged 0–14 years. Data sources include a longitudinal study conducted by the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia and the World Bank as well as model-based estimates from World Health Organization 2017 and Global Burden of Disease 2016 project.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Injuries caused about 25 thousand deaths among 0-14-year olds in Ethiopia in 2015. The leading cause of fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia was road-traffic injuries, followed by fire, heat and hot substances and drowning. The death rate due to injuries among 0–14 years olds was about 50 percent higher in males than females. Rural children were exposed to a greater risk of injury than their urban peers. The longitudinal survey suggests that the incidence rate of child injuries increased during the period 2011–2014. The annual mortality caused by injuries is projected to increase from 10,697 in 2015 to 11,279 in 2020 and 11,989 in 2030 among children under 5 years, an increase of 12 percentage points in 15 years. The number of deaths among 0-14-year olds will be 26,463, 27,807, and 30,364 respectively in 2015, 2020, and 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;As the first multisectoral collaboration on child injuries in Ethiopia, this study identified gaps in understanding of the burden of child injuries in Ethiopia. In consultation with Ethiopian government and other stakeholders, we propose starting an injury surveillance system at health clinics and hospitals and building an intervention package based on existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Qingfeng Li</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194692</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f08:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>6d69379</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qingfeng Li, Olakunle Alonge, Collene Lawhorn, Yirga Ambaw, Smita Kumar, Troy Jacobs, Adnan A.

Data sources include a longitudinal study conducted by the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia and the World Bank as well as model-based estimates from World Health Organization 2017 and Global Burden of Disease 2016 project.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Injuries caused about 25 thousand deaths among 0-14-year olds in Ethiopia in 2015. The leading cause of fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia was road-traffic injuries, followed by fire, heat and hot substances and drowning. The death rate due to injuries among 0–14 years olds was about 50 percent higher in males than females. Rural children were exposed to a greater risk of injury than their urban peers. The longitudinal survey suggests that the incidence rate of child injuries increased during the period 2011–2014. The annual mortality caused by injuries is projected to increase from 10,697 in 2015 to 11,279 in 2020 and 11,989 in 2030 among children under 5 years, an increase of 12 percentage points in 15 years. The number of deaths among 0-14-year olds will be 26,463, 27,807, and 30,364 respectively in 2015, 2020, and 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;As the first multisectoral collaboration on child injuries in Ethiopia, this study identified gaps in understanding of the burden of child injuries in Ethiopia. In consultation with Ethiopian government and other stakeholders, we propose starting an injury surveillance system at health clinics and hospitals and building an intervention package based on existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522184400000</published><title>Child injuries in Ethiopia: A review of the current situation with projections</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194693</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194693</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194693</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ada Aita, Daniela Basso, Roberta Ramonda, Stefania Moz, Mariagrazia Lorenzin, Filippo Navaglia, Carlo-Federico Zambon, Andrea Padoan, Mario Plebani, Leonardo Punzi&lt;/p&gt;
Objectives &lt;p&gt;We investigated whether polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt;, or in the autoinflammatory &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; genes, concur with &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; in enhancing the risk of Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and/or in predicting the response to anti-TNFα treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;373 controls and 137 SpA (82 with Psoriatic Arthritis-PsA and 55 with Ankylosing Spondylitis- AS; 98/137 under TNFα inhibitor therapy) from the Veneto Region (Italy) were studied. &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms (-1031T&gt;C;-857C&gt;T;-376G&gt;A;-308G&gt;A;-238G&gt;A) and &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; were assayed by RT-PCR. Direct sequencing of &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; (exons 2,3,5 and 10) and &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; (exons 2,3,4 and 6) genes were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; was associated with AS (χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 120.1; p = 0.000). Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance. Variant alleles were extremely rare in our population (MAF&amp;lt;0.025) except for R202Q (MAF = 0.27).

Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by a progressive loss of articular cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis and synovial inflammation and is the most common chronic condition worldwide today. However, most treatments have focused on pain relief and OA symptoms. For these reasons, many ongoing studies are currently trying to develop efficient and successful therapies based on its pathology. Animal models that mimic the histopathology and symptoms of OA have a critical role in OA research and make it possible to investigate both secondary osteoarthritic changes due to a precedent event such as traumatic injury and naturally occurring changes for the development of therapeutics which can be tested in preclinical and clinical OA trials. We induced OA in various animal models including rats, rabbits and guinea pigs by chemical, surgical and naturally occurring methods. In particular, the Dunkin-Hartley guinea pig is very attractive as an OA animal model because OA slowly progresses which is similar to human primary OA. Thus, this animal model mimics the pathophysiological process and environment of human primary OA. Besides the spontaneous OA model, anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) with medial meniscectomy and bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) as well as a chemical technique using sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) were used to induce OA. We found that ACLT in the rat model induced OA changes in the histology and micro-CT image compared to OVX. The osteoarthritic change significantly increased following ACLT surgery in the rabbit model. Furthermore, we identified that OA pathogenic changes occurred in a time-dependent manner in spontaneous Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs. The MIA injection model is a rapid and minimally invasive method for inducing OA in animal models, whereas the spontaneous OA model has a slow and gradual progression of OA similar to human primary OA. We observed that histological OA change was extraordinarily increased at 9 ½ months in the spontaneous OA model, and thus, the grade was similar with that of the MIA model. Therefore, this study reports on OA pathology using various animal models as well as the spontaneous results naturally occurring in an OA animal model which had developed cartilage lesions and progressive osteoarthritic changes.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Ji Eun Kim</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194288</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d69:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>496f38ce</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Eun Kim, Da-hyun Song, Soo Hyun Kim, Youngmee Jung, Sang Jun Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, this study reports on OA pathology using various animal models as well as the spontaneous results naturally occurring in an OA animal model which had developed cartilage lesions and progressive osteoarthritic changes.</description><published>1520974800000</published><title>Development and characterization of various osteoarthritis models for tissue engineering</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1475-a?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1475-a?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1475-a?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522345097000</published><author><name>Perez-Escobar, O.

In pluripotent stem cells, rapidly-evolving KRAB-ZNF genes target TEs for silencing by H3K9me3. To investigate the evolution of TE silencing, we performed H3K9me3 ChIP-seq experiments in induced pluripotent stem cells from ten human and seven chimpanzee individuals. We identified four million orthologous TEs and found the SVA and ERV families to be marked most frequently by H3K9me3. We found little evidence of inter-species differences in TE silencing, with as many as 82% of putatively silenced TEs marked at similar levels in humans and chimpanzees. TEs that are preferentially silenced in one species are a similar age to those silenced in both species, and are not more likely to be associated with expression divergence of nearby orthologous genes. Our data suggest limited species-specificity of TE silencing across six million years of primate evolution.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Transposable elements (TEs) comprise almost half of primate genomes and their aberrant regulation can result in deleterious effects. In pluripotent stem cells, rapidly-evolving KRAB-ZNF genes target TEs for silencing by H3K9me3. To investigate the evolution of TE silencing, we performed H3K9me3 ChIP-seq experiments in induced pluripotent stem cells from ten human and seven chimpanzee individuals. We identified four million orthologous TEs and found the SVA and ERV families to be marked most frequently by H3K9me3. We found little evidence of inter-species differences in TE silencing, with as many as 82% of putatively silenced TEs marked at similar levels in humans and chimpanzees. TEs that are preferentially silenced in one species are a similar age to those silenced in both species, and are not more likely to be associated with expression divergence of nearby orthologous genes. Our data suggest limited species-specificity of TE silencing across six million years of primate evolution.</content></summary><title>Silencing of transposable elements may not be a major driver of regulatory evolution in primate iPSCs</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31867</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31867</link><crawled>1522930738127</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522886400000</published><author><name>st2744@columbia.edu (Amir Momen-Roknabadi)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31867</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16295bee3cf:a178316:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31867</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>dbd3e859</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item><item>Genes and Chromosomes</item></keywords><description>Cells adapt to familiar changes in their environment by activating predefined regulatory programs that establish adaptive gene expression states.

Background &lt;p&gt;In patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction is frequent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

The exclusion criterion was presence of cardiac diseases, independent of liver cirrhosis. Biochemical parameters were analysed using standard methods. HRT was assessed using Turbulence onset (TO) and slope (TS). The endpoint was deterioration of liver cirrhosis defined as increased MELD and readmission for complications of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 122 cirrhotic patients, 82 patients (63% male) with median Child score of 6 (range 5–12) and median MELD score of 10 (range 6–32) were included. Increasing Child score, INR and decreasing albumin were correlated with TO. In addition, decompensated patients with ascites showed more abnormal TO and TS. During the observation period, patients with more abnormal TO showed significantly higher rate of rising MELD Score at 6 months (p = 0.03).

Our novel variable selection method with lasso regression also allows FDC on other datasets and questions, even beyond network inference and computational biology. Lassopv is implemented in R and freely available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/lassopv and https://cran.r-project.org/package=lassopv.</description><published>1522134000000</published><title>Controlling false discoveries in Bayesian gene networks with lasso regression p-values [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017854?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017854?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017854?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1521172843000</published><author><name>D.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the predictive factors for lateral pelvic lymph node (LPLN) metastasis in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and LPLNs larger than 5 mm underwent LPLN dissection (LPLD) after preoperative CRT. The MRI findings, including the apparent diffusion coefficient value and LPLN size reduction rate before/after CRT; clinical factors; and pathologic results were evaluated to identify the predictive factors associated with LPLN metastasis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;LPLN metastasis was confirmed in 23 patients (40.4%). Metastasis was significantly higher in LPLNs with multiplicity, short-axis diameter ≥8 mm before CRT, short-axis diameter &gt;5 mm after CRT, size reduction rate ≤33.3%, heterogeneous signal intensity, and irregular margin (P&amp;lt;0.05) on MR. Multivariable analysis showed that pre-CRT short-axis diameter of LPLNs ≥8 mm, size reduction rate ≤33.3%, and heterogeneous signal intensity were independently associated with LPLN metastasis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The size and signal intensity of LPLN before and after CRT are useful MRI findings to predict LPLN metastasis and are helpful to determine the indications for LPLD.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Min Ju Kim</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195815</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66ce:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>23de69c6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Min Ju Kim, Bo Yun Hur, Eun Sun Lee, Boram Park, Jungnam Joo, Min Jung Kim, Sung Chan Park, Ji Yeon Baek, Hee Jin Chang, Dae Yong Kim, Jae Hwan Oh&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper we explored the effects of exposure to images of the suffering and vulnerability of others on altruistic, trust-based, and reciprocated incentivized economic decisions, accounting for differences in participants’ dispositional empathy and reported in-group trust for their recipient(s). This was done using a pictorial priming task, framed as a memory test, and a triadic economic game design. Using the largest experimental sample to date to explore this issue, our integrated analysis of two online experiments (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 519), found statistically consistent evidence that exposure to images of suffering and vulnerability (vs. neutral images) increased altruistic in-group giving as measured by the “triple dictator game”, and that the manipulation was significantly more effective in those who reported lower trust for their recipients. The experimental manipulation also significantly increased altruistic giving in the standard “dictator game” and trust-based giving in the “investment game”, but only in those who were lower in in-group trust and also high in affective or cognitive empathy. Complementary qualitative evidence revealed the strongest motivations associated with increased giving in the experimental condition were greater assumed reciprocation and a lower aversion to risk. However, no consistent effects of the experimental manipulation on participants’ reciprocated decisions were observed. These findings suggest that, as well as altruistic decision-making in the “triple dictator game”, collaboratively witnessing the suffering of others may heighten trust-based in-group giving in the “investment game” for some people, but the effects are heterogeneous and sensitive to context.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Philip A.

Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) is a software package designed to perform continuum mechanics simulations of proteins and other globular macromolecules. It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools. It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted. In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license. The software package includes a C ++ implementation of FFEA, together with tools to assist the user to set up the system from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) or Protein Data Bank (PDB) data files. We also provide a PyMOL plugin to perform basic visualisation and additional Python tools for the analysis of FFEA simulation trajectories. This manuscript provides a basic background to the FFEA method, describing the implementation of the core mechanical model and how intermolecular interactions and the solvent environment are included within this framework. We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hC4qKh8DkTM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005897</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005897</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16253fa0281:3c81d7:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521827316353</crawled><fingerprint>f5bab2e6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Albert Solernou, Benjamin S.

It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted. In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license. The software package includes a C ++ implementation of FFEA, together with tools to assist the user to set up the system from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) or Protein Data Bank (PDB) data files. We also provide a PyMOL plugin to perform basic visualisation and additional Python tools for the analysis of FFEA simulation trajectories. This manuscript provides a basic background to the FFEA method, describing the implementation of the core mechanical model and how intermolecular interactions and the solvent environment are included within this framework. We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hC4qKh8DkTM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1521836646231</recrawled><published>1521838800000</published><title>Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA): A continuum mechanics software tool for mesoscale simulation of biomolecules</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>221</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174/20180413/images/medium/mp-2018-001746_0010.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/KwL5leqgttc/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523592000000</published><author><name>Hiroshi Ueda, Wenqi Wu, Korbinian Löbmann, Holger Grohganz, Anette Müllertz, Thomas Rades</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174</link><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_162bf2412ce:32663:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523625235150</crawled><fingerprint>21ed6470</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174/20180413/images/medium/mp-2018-001746_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00174&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses. The most prominent effect was decreased pelvic rise that occurred as the rider was actively rising up in the stirrups, thus creating a downward momentum counteracting the horses push off. This mimics a push off lameness in the hindlimb that is in stance when the rider sits down in the saddle during the rising trot. On the circle, the asymmetries induced by rising trot on the correct diagonal counteracted the circle induced asymmetries, rendering the horse more symmetrical. This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness. This theory needs to be studied further in clinically lame horses.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Emma Persson-Sjodin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4615:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>b3a0b371</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Persson-Sjodin, Elin Hernlund, Thilo Pfau, Pia Haubro Andersen, Marie Rhodin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Swimming in fecally-contaminated waterbodies can result in gastrointestinal infections. However, the pathogenic microorganisms responsible are not well understood because sporadic cases of illness are not reported completely, exposure information is often not collected, and epidemiology studies rely on self-reported symptoms. Noroviruses are considered a likely cause because they are found in high densities in sewage, resistant to wastewater treatment and survive in the environment. In this study, saliva samples were collected from subjects at a beach in Puerto Rico and tested for evidence of norovirus-specific IgG responses as an indicator of incident norovirus infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Saliva samples were collected from 1298 participants using an oral swab. Samples were collected on the day of the beach visit (S1); after 10–12 days (S2); and after three weeks (S3). Saliva was tested for IgG responses to GI.1 and GII.4 noroviruses using a microsphere based multiplex salivary immunoassay. Immunoconversion was defined as a four-fold increase in median fluorescence intensity (MFI) from S1 to S2 with the S3 sample at least three times above the S1 MFI.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-four subjects (2.6%) immunoconverted to GI.1 or GII.4 norovirus. Swimmers who immersed their head in water had a higher rate of immunoconversion (3.4%), compared to either non-swimmers (0.0%, p = 0.003) or waders and non-swimmers combined (0.4%, Odds Ratio: 5.07, 95% Confidence Interval:1.48–17.00). Immunoconversion was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study to demonstrate an association between swimming at a beach impacted by fecal contamination and asymptomatic norovirus infection. The findings implicate recreational water as potentially important transmission pathway for norovirus infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Timothy J.

For the overall agreement, sensitivity and positive predictive value, outcomes above 90% are considered excellent, between 70 and 90% good, and below 70% unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Division in two classes resulted in overall agreement of 82.1%, sensitivity of 77.7% and positive predictive value of 78.2%. 84.5% of total duration of all tasks was classified identically by Activ8 and based on the video material.

Epileptic seizures are known to follow specific changes in brain dynamics. While some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes, a clear understanding of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still lacking. Here, we provide crossvalidated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our analysis of long intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable (&amp;quot;degenerate&amp;quot;), and this phase is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to be particularly associated with the activity of the resected regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome. Our approach characterizes preseizure network dynamics as a cascade of 2 sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/DHVkBqQJLvk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002580</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002580</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e6:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522950975641</crawled><fingerprint>8c94dc9b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adrià Tauste Campo, Alessandro Principe, Miguel Ley, Rodrigo Rocamora, Gustavo Deco&lt;/p&gt;

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt;, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coluzzii&lt;/i&gt; independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily. Overall, this exploratory study provides valuable indications of spatial and seasonal differences in bacterial composition which help refine this difficult to study state.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Benjamin J.

Adherent cells sense the physical properties of their environment via focal adhesions. Improved understanding of how cells sense and response to their physical surroundings is aided by quantitative evaluation of focal adhesion size, number, orientation, and distribution in conjunction with the morphology of single cells and the corresponding nuclei. We developed a fast, user-friendly and automated image analysis algorithm capable of capturing and characterizing these individual components with a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the algorithm by quantifying morphological changes in response to a variety of environmental changes as well as manipulations of cellular components of mechanotransductions. Finally, as a proof-of-concept we use our algorithm to quantify the effect of Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632 on focal adhesion maturation. We show that a decrease in cell contractility leads to a decrease in focal adhesion size and aspect ratio.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Antonetta B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sleep disordered breathing is a common but often undiagnosed comorbidity in heart failure patients. Cardiac implantable electronic devices used for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may detect sleep apnea by use of a transthoracic impedance sensor. Validation of the AP scan® algorithm (Boston Scientific®) was performed by using the diagnostic gold standard polysomnography (PSG).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction, frequent right ventricular pacing due to atrioventricular block and heart failure symptoms despite optimal medical therapy underwent upgrading to biventricular pacing. Within one month after left ventricular lead implantation, sleep apnea was assessed by single-night PSG and AP scan® measurements.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;AP scan® measurements were valid in only 21 of 41 (51.2%) patients in the index night of the PSG. The PSG determined apnea-hypopnea index did not correlate statistically significant with the AP scan® measurements (r = 0.41, 95% confidence interval -0.05–0.72, p = 0.07). The degree of overestimation is displayed by using the Bland-Altman method: mean difference -12.4, standard deviation ± 15.8, 95% confidence interval -43.3–18.6.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In heart failure patients receiving CRT upgrading, the AP scan® algorithm may need further improvement before it can be recommended for sleep apnea detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Fabian Barbieri</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195573</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd084:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>5406c201</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabian Barbieri, Wolfgang Dichtl, Anna Heidbreder, Elisabeth Brandauer, Ambra Stefani, Agne Adukauskaite, Thomas Senoner, Wilfried Schgör, Florian Hintringer, Birgit Högl&lt;/p&gt;

Bats lower the emission SPL when approaching a target. The SPL reduction has been explained by intensity compensation which implies that bats adjust the emission SPL to perceive the retuning echoes at the same level. For a better understanding of this control mechanism we recorded the echolocation signals of four &lt;i&gt;Myotis myotis&lt;/i&gt; with an onboard microphone when foraging in the passive mode for rustling mealworms offered in two feeding dishes with different target strength, and determined the reduction rate for the emission SPL and the increase rate for the SPL of the returning echoes. When approaching the dish with higher target strength bats started the reduction of the emission SPL at a larger reaction distance (1.05 ± 0.21 m) and approached it with a lower reduction rate of 7.2 dB/halving of distance (hd), thus producing a change of echo rate at the ears of + 4 dB/hd.

Bats lower the emission SPL when approaching a target. The SPL reduction has been explained by intensity compensation which implies that bats adjust the emission SPL to perceive the retuning echoes at the same level. For a better understanding of this control mechanism we recorded the echolocation signals of four &lt;i&gt;Myotis myotis&lt;/i&gt; with an onboard microphone when foraging in the passive mode for rustling mealworms offered in two feeding dishes with different target strength, and determined the reduction rate for the emission SPL and the increase rate for the SPL of the returning echoes. When approaching the dish with higher target strength bats started the reduction of the emission SPL at a larger reaction distance (1.05 ± 0.21 m) and approached it with a lower reduction rate of 7.2 dB/halving of distance (hd), thus producing a change of echo rate at the ears of + 4 dB/hd. At the weaker target reaction distance was shorter (0.71 ± 0.24 m) and the reduction rate (9.1 dB/hd) was higher, producing a change of echo rate of—1.2 dB/hd. Independent of dish type, bats lowered the emission SPL by about 26 dB on average. In one bat where the echo SPL from both targets could be measured, the reduction of emission SPL was triggered when the echo SPL surpassed a similar threshold value around 41–42 dB. Echo SPL was not adjusted at a constant value indicating that &lt;i&gt;Myotis myotis&lt;/i&gt; and most likely all other bats do not use a closed loop system for intensity compensation when approaching a target of interest. We propose that bats lower the emission SPL to adjust the SPL of the perceived pulse-echo-pairs to the optimal auditory range for the processing of range information and hypothesize that bats use flow field information not only to control the reduction of the approach speed to the target but also to control the reduction of emission SPL.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Reduction of emission level in approach signals of greater mouse-eared bats (&amp;lt;i&gt;Myotis myotis&amp;lt;/i&gt;): No evidence for a closed loop control system for intensity compensation</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-d?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-d?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-d?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523554636000</published><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/167.4.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fecec9:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><fingerprint>b4cc10c5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Denisovans shaped our genomes, twice</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03622-0</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03622-0</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/5MtI8jBK7d4/s41467-018-03622-0</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategically growing the urban forest will improve our world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategically growing the urban forest will improve our world, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03622-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03622-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Strategically growing the urban forest will improve our world&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/5MtI8jBK7d4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Theodore A.

The increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus is becoming a serious threat to human health in various parts of the world. Studies with dairy products have shown a potential beneficial effect against diabetes. This experiment evaluated the supplementation of milk naturally enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and polyphenols in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Forty male 28-day-old &lt;i&gt;Wistar&lt;/i&gt; rats were distributed in four experimental treatments of diabetic animals (streptozotocin induction) and a normal group (non-induced). Experimental treatments were: control (water), whole common milk (COM-M), milk enriched with PUFA (PUFA-M), milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols (PUFA/P-M) through a special diet offered to dairy cows. Milk supplementation at a dose 5 mL/kg body weight was performed for 77 days, 42 days before and 35 days after diabetes induction. The COM-M supplementation increased brown fat deposits, reduced post-induction glucose levels, reduced blood fructosamine levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Milk enriched with PUFA reduced final fasting glucose, LDL levels, and improved blood antioxidant capacity. Milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols promoted an increase in gastrocnemius muscle mass, and a reduction in mesenteric fat and LDL levels. Milk intake, with an emphasis on milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols, attenuated the metabolic disorders of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Emerson H.

Understanding the regulation of insulin biosynthesis is important as it plays a central role in glucose metabolism. The mouse insulin gene2 (Ins2) has two splice variants; long (Ins2L) and short (Ins2S), that differ only in their 5’UTR sequence and Ins2S is the major transcript which translate more efficiently as compared to Ins2L. Here, we show that cellular factors bind preferentially to the Ins2L 5’UTR, and that PABP and HuD can bind to Ins2 splice variants and regulate its translation. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding assay with insulin 5’UTR and different HuD isoforms indicate that the ‘N’ terminal region of HuD is important for RNA binding and insulin translation repression. Using reporter assay we showed that specifically full-length HuD A isoform represses translation of reporter containing insulin 5’UTR. We further show that PABP and HuD interact with each other in RNA-dependent manner and this interaction is affected by glucose and PDI (5’UTR associated translation activator). These results suggest that PABP interacts with HuD in basal glucose conditions making translation inhibitory complex, however upon glucose stimulation this association is affected and PABP is acted upon by PDI resulting in stimulation of insulin translation. Together, our findings snapshot the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of insulin biosynthesis.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Poonam R.

We analyse the behaviour of a non-linear model of coupled stock and bond prices exhibiting periodically collapsing bubbles. By using the formalism of dynamical system theory, we explain what drives the bubbles and how foreshocks or aftershocks are generated. A dynamical phase space representation of that system coupled with standard multiplicative noise rationalises the log-periodic power law singularity pattern documented in many historical financial bubbles. The notion of ‘ghosts of finite-time singularities’ is introduced and used to estimate the end of an evolving bubble, using finite-time singularities of an approximate normal form near the bifurcation point. We test the forecasting skill of this method on different stochastic price realisations and compare with Monte Carlo simulations of the full system. Remarkably, the approximate normal form is significantly more precise and less biased. Moreover, the method of ghosts of singularities is less sensitive to the noise realisation, thus providing more robust forecasts.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Damian Smug</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195265</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde31:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>be8252c3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Damian Smug, Peter Ashwin, Didier Sornette&lt;/p&gt;

Industry-driven voluntary disease control programs for swine diseases emerged in North America in the early 2000’s, and, since then, those programs have been used for monitoring diseases of economic importance to swine producers. One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison’s Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus.

Industry-driven voluntary disease control programs for swine diseases emerged in North America in the early 2000’s, and, since then, those programs have been used for monitoring diseases of economic importance to swine producers. One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison’s Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted followed by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, conducted separately for each of the above-mentioned states. Results showed that there was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. Of note, when comparing states, the typical seasonal pattern previously described for PRRS could only be detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states, seasonal peaks every six months were detected within a year. In conclusion, we showed that epidemic patterns are not homogeneous across the U.S, with major peaks of disease occurring through the year. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating alternative control strategies in different regions considering the prevailing epidemiological patterns.</description><published>1522789200000</published><title>Time-series analysis for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in the United States</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/287011v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/287011v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/287011v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here we introduce bioLQM, a new Java software tool for the conversion, transformation, and analysis of Logical Qualitative Models of biological regulatory networks, aiming to foster the development of novel complementary tools by providing core model manipulation and format conversion operations.

Oral sensitivity to fats varies in individuals influencing nutritional status and health. Variations in oleic acid perception are associated with &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and odorant binding protein (&lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt;) polymorphisms, and 6-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-propylthiouracil (PROP) sensitivity, which is mediated by TAS2R38 receptor. L-Arginine (L-Arg) supplementation was shown to modify the perception of the five taste qualities. Here we analyzed the effect of three concentrations (5, 10, 15 mmol/L) of L-Arg on oral perception of oleic acid in forty-six subjects classified for PROP taster status and genotyped for &lt;i&gt;TAS2R38&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms. L-Arg supplementation was effective in increasing the perceived intensity of oleic acid in most subjects. The lowest concentration was the most effective, especially in PROP non-tasters or medium tasters, and in subjects with at least an allele A in &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt; loci. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were exploited to characterize the chemical interaction between L-Arg and oleic acid, showing that a stable 1:1 oleate·ArgH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; adduct can be formed, stabilized by a pair of hydrogen bonds. Results indicate that L-Arg, acting as a ‘carrier’ of fatty acids in saliva, can selectively modify taste response, and suggest that it may to be used in personalized dietetic strategies to optimize eating behaviors and health.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Melania Melis</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194953</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34c3:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>81f13ac0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Melania Melis, Mariano Mastinu, Massimiliano Arca, Roberto Crnjar, Iole Tomassini Barbarossa&lt;/p&gt;

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction following left ventricular (LV) failure is associated with poor prognosis. RV remodeling is thought initiated by the increase in the afterload of RV due to secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) to impaired LV function; however, RV molecular changes might occur in earlier stages of the disease. cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)-phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, widely used to treat PH through their pulmonary vasorelaxation properties, have shown direct cardiac benefits, but their impacts on the RV in LV diseases are not fully determined. Here we show that RV molecular alterations occur early in the absence of RV hemodynamic changes during LV pressure-overload and are ameliorated by PDE5 inhibition. Two-day moderate LV pressure-overload (transverse aortic constriction) neither altered RV pressure/ function nor RV weight in mice, while it induced only mild LV hypertrophy. Importantly, pathological molecular features were already induced in the RV free wall myocardium, including up-regulation of gene markers for hypertrophy and inflammation, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and calcineurin. Concomitant PDE5 inhibition (sildenafil) prevented induction of such pathological genes and activation of ERK and calcineurin in the RV as well as in the LV. Importantly, dexamethasone also prevented these RV molecular changes, similarly to sildenafil treatment. These results suggest the contributory role of inflammation to the early pathological interventricular interaction between RV and LV. The current study provides the first evidence for the novel early molecular cross-talk between RV and LV, preceding RV hemodynamic changes in LV disease, and supports the therapeutic strategy of enhancing cGMP signaling pathway to treat heart diseases.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Yousuke Imai</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195528</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>727a0802</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yousuke Imai, Taro Kariya, Masaki Iwakiri, Yoshitsugu Yamada, Eiki Takimoto&lt;/p&gt;

The current study provides the first evidence for the novel early molecular cross-talk between RV and LV, preceding RV hemodynamic changes in LV disease, and supports the therapeutic strategy of enhancing cGMP signaling pathway to treat heart diseases.</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>Sildenafil ameliorates right ventricular early molecular derangement during left ventricular pressure overload</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23230-8</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23230-8</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/RlnDM9n8TJ0/s41598-018-23230-8</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: A Flexible Electret Membrane with Persistent Electrostatic Effect and Resistance to Harsh Environment for Energy Harvesting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: A Flexible Electret Membrane with Persistent Electrostatic Effect and Resistance to Harsh Environment for Energy Harvesting, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23230-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23230-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: A Flexible Electret Membrane with Persistent Electrostatic Effect and Resistance to Harsh Environment for Energy Harvesting&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RlnDM9n8TJ0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Xiao Huiming</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23230-8</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1624cc6c7fd:3d6fea7:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521706518525</crawled><fingerprint>9522245e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: A Flexible Electret Membrane with Persistent Electrostatic Effect and Resistance to Harsh Environment for Energy Harvesting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: A Flexible Electret Membrane with Persistent Electrostatic Effect and Resistance to Harsh Environment for Energy Harvesting, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23230-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23230-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: A Flexible Electret Membrane with Persistent Electrostatic Effect and Resistance to Harsh Environment for Energy Harvesting&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RlnDM9n8TJ0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1521702000000</published><title>Author Correction: A Flexible Electret Membrane with Persistent Electrostatic Effect and Resistance to Harsh Environment for Energy Harvesting</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194883</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194883</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194883</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tarak Dhaouadi, Mayssa Chahbi, Youssra Haouami, Imen Sfar, Leila Abdelmoula, Taieb Ben Abdallah, Yousr Gorgi&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a cytokine mainly secreted by Th17 cells, seems to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Functional genetic polymorphisms in IL-17 and its receptor genes can influence either qualitatively or quantitatively their functions. Therefore, we aimed to study the impact of IL17-A and IL17RC polymorphisms on plasma level of IL-17 and RA susceptibility and severity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this context, IL-17A*rs2275913 and IL-17RC*rs708567 polymorphisms were investigated together with the quantification of IL17 plasma level in 115 RA patients and 91 healthy control subjects matched in age, sex and ethnic origin.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no statistically significant associations between IL-17A and IL-17RC studied polymorphisms and RA susceptibility. In contrast, IL-17A plasma levels were significantly higher in patients (55.07 pg/ml) comparatively to controls (4.75 pg/ml), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;10E-12. A ROC curve was used to evaluate the performance of plasma IL-17 in detecting RA. Given 100% specificity, the highest sensitivity of plasma IL-17A was 61.7% at a cut-off value of 18.25 pg/ml; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10E-21, CI = [0.849–0.939]. Analytic results showed that the IgM-rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies were significantly less frequent in patients with the IL-17RC*A/A genotype than those carrying *G/G and *G/A genotypes; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015, respectively. Otherwise, IL-17 plasma levels’ analysis showed a significant association with the activity of RA (DAS28≥5.1 = 74.71 pg/ml vs. DAS28&amp;lt;5.1 = 11.96 pg/ml), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;10E-6.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;IL-17A*rs2275913 (G/A) and IL-17RC*rs708567 (G/A) polymorphisms did not seem to influence RA susceptibility in Tunisian population.

The relationship between ABO blood groups (BG) and risk of incidence in cancers including gynecological cancers has been widely studied, showing increased incidence risk for BG A patients. As available data are inconsistent we investigated whether BG and their anti-glycan antibodies (anti-A and anti-B) have prognostic values in gynecological cancers. We retrospectively evaluated 974 patients with gynecological cancers in three cancer centers (Switzerland and Australia) between 1974 and 2014 regarding the relationships between clinico-pathological findings and the BG. Time to disease recurrence was significantly influenced by BG in patients with ovarian (n = 282) and vulvar (n = 67) cancer. BG O or B patients showed a significantly increased risk for ovarian cancer relapse compared to A, 59% and 82%, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.045; HR O vs A = 1.59 (CI 1.01–2.51) and (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036; HR A vs B = 0.55 (CI 0.32–0.96). Median time to relapse for advanced stage (n = 126) ovarian cancer patients was 18.2 months for BG O and 32.2 for A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031; HR O vs A = 2.07 (CI 1.07–4.02)). BG also significantly influenced relapse-free survival in patients with vulvar cancer (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), with BG O tending to have increased relapse risk compared to A (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.089). Blood groups hence associate with recurrence in ovarian and vulvar cancer: women with BG O seem to have a lower ovarian cancer incidence, however are more likely to relapse earlier. The significance of the BG status as a prognostic value is evident and may be helpful to oncologists in prognosticating disease outcome and selecting the appropriate therapy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Céline Montavon Sartorius</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195213</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde28:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>985d93ea</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Céline Montavon Sartorius, Andreas Schoetzau, Henriette Kettelhack, Daniel Fink, Neville F.

Background &lt;p&gt;Healthcare students are future health care providers and serve as role models and coaches to enhance behaviors for healthy lifestyles. However healthcare students face multiple stressors that could lead to adopting risk behaviors.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the changes in health risk factors among healthcare students between 2007 and 2015, and to identify specific health behaviors based on the curriculum in a population of healthcare students:&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two cross sectionnal studies were conducted in 2007 and 2015 among nursing, medical, pharmacy, and physiotherapy students (Rouen, France). During compulsory courses and examination sessions students filled self-administered questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics and behavior as: tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, cannabis consumption, eating disorders, regular practice of sport, perceived health, stress and use of psychotropic drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;2,605 healthcare students were included (1,326 in 2007 and 1,279 in 2015), comprising 1,225 medical students (47.0%), 738 nursing students (28.3%), 362 pharmacy students (13.9%), and 280 physiotherapy students (10.8%). Between 2007 and 2015, occasional binge drinking and regular practice of sport increased significantly among healthcare students, respectively AOR = 1.48 CI95% (1.20–1.83) and AOR = 1.33 CI95% (1.11–1.60), regular cannabis consumption decreased significantly, AOR = 0.32 CI95% (0.19–0.54). There was no change in smoking or overweight/obese. There was a higher risk of frequent binge drinking and a lower risk of tobacco smoking in all curricula than in nursing students. Medical students practiced sport on a more regular basis, were less overweight/obese, had fewer eating disorders than nursing students.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate a stable frequency of classic behaviors as smoking but a worsening of emerging behaviors as binge drinking among healthcare students between 2007 and 2015. Health behaviors differed according to healthcare curricula and nursing students demonstrated higher risks.

One of the more fundamental health policy questions is the relationship between health care quality and spending. A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46). Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Farah Rahman</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195222</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5c:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>13e993e5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farah Rahman, Jun Guan, Richard H.

In face-to-face social interactions, blind and visually impaired persons (VIPs) lack access to nonverbal cues like facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, which may lead to impaired interpersonal communication. In this study, a wearable sensory substitution device (SSD) consisting of a head mounted camera and a haptic belt was evaluated to determine whether vibrotactile cues around the waist could be used to convey facial expressions to users and whether such a device is desired by VIPs for use in daily living situations. Ten VIPs (mean age: 38.8, SD: 14.4) and 10 sighted persons (SPs) (mean age: 44.5, SD: 19.6) participated in the study, in which validated sets of pictures, silent videos, and videos with audio of facial expressions were presented to the participant. A control measurement was first performed to determine how accurately participants could identify facial expressions while relying on their functional senses. After a short training, participants were asked to determine facial expressions while wearing the emotion feedback system. VIPs using the device showed significant improvements in their ability to determine which facial expressions were shown. A significant increase in accuracy of 44.4% was found across all types of stimuli when comparing the scores of the control (mean±SEM: 35.0±2.5%) and supported (mean±SEM: 79.4±2.1%) phases. The greatest improvements achieved with the support of the SSD were found for silent stimuli (68.3% for pictures and 50.8% for silent videos). SPs also showed consistent, though not statistically significant, improvements while supported. Overall, our study shows that vibrotactile cues are well suited to convey facial expressions to VIPs in real-time. Participants became skilled with the device after a short training session. Further testing and development of the SSD is required to improve its accuracy and aesthetics for potential daily use.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Hendrik P.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic assessment tools remain suboptimal in demonstrating complex morphology of congenital heart disease (CHD). This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic assessment tools remain suboptimal in demonstrating complex morphology of congenital heart disease (CHD). This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing. Qualitative analysis was conducted by distributing surveys to six health professionals (two radiologists, two cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons) and three medical academics to assess the clinical value of the 3D printed model in these three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was noted in the measurements between CCTA and 3D printed model, with a mean difference of 0.23 mm.

The present study is aimed at assessing the feasibility of delivering the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine to girls through a school-based program in Hong Kong, as well as to examine the facilitators and barriers associated with their participation. We approached 1,229 eligible girls aged 9 to 14 at eight schools in Hong Kong to join the program and then delivered the bivalent HPV vaccine at 0 and 6 months over the course of one school year. The students and their parents completed separate questionnaires to indicate their decision on whether or not to participate, and to assess their knowledge of cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine. The overall vaccine uptake was 81.4% (1,000/1,229) for the first dose and 80.8% (993/1,229) for the second dose. Parents and students were given separate questionnaires and asked whether or not they would like to participate in the vaccination program. 87.1% (1,010/1,160) of parents and 84.9% (974/1,147) of students indicated that they would join the program. The reasons associated with parents’ decision not to vaccinate their daughters primarily included concerns around side effects and safety. Multivariate regression analysis showed that parents who thought that the vaccine would protect their daughter from getting cervical cancer (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.39–7.15, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01), and those who reported having a doctor’s recommendation (OR = 4.54, 95% CI = 1.05–19.57, p &amp;lt; .05) were more likely to join the program. In contrast, parents who had never heard of the vaccine (OR = .15, 95% CI = .03–.71, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .02), those who were willing to pay more than HK$2,000 for the vaccine (OR = .39, 95% CI = .19–.81, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05), or had a preference to access it through a private clinic (OR = .44, 95% CI = .26–.75, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01) were significantly less likely to allow their daughter to join the program. Delivery of the HPV vaccine with high uptake rate in a school setting is feasible in Hong Kong. Engaging key stakeholders including school administrators, teachers and community physicians, and providing relevant information on safety and vaccine effectiveness to parents were important to the success of the program.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Winnie Wing Yan Yuen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194159</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e0b:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>f40dca57</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Winnie Wing Yan Yuen, Albert Lee, Paul K.

Strategic purchasing is an essential health financing function. This paper compares the strategic purchasing practices of Thailand’s two tax-financed health insurance schemes, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), and identifies factors contributing to successful universal health coverage outcomes by analysing the relationships between the purchaser and government, providers and members. The study uses a cross-sectional mixed-methods design, including document review and interviews with 56 key informants. The Comptroller General Department (CGD) of Ministry of Finance manages CSMBS as one among civil servant welfare programmes. Their purchasing is passive. Fee for service payment for outpatient care has resulted in rapid cost escalation and overspending of their annual budget. In contrast, National Health Security Office (NHSO) manages purchasing for UCS, which undertakes a range of strategic purchasing actions, including applying closed ended provider payment, promoting primary healthcare’s gate keeping functions, exercising collective purchasing power and engaging views of members in decision making process. This difference in purchasing arrangements resulted in expenditure per CSMBS member being 4 times higher than UCS in 2014. The governance of the purchaser organization, the design of the purchasing arrangements including incentives and use of information, and the institutional capacities to implement purchasing functions are essential for effective strategic purchasing which can improve health system efficiency as a whole.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Walaiporn Patcharanarumol</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195179</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76928:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>9ee1557c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Walaiporn Patcharanarumol, Warisa Panichkriangkrai, Angkana Sommanuttaweechai, Kara Hanson, Yaowaluk Wanwong, Viroj Tangcharoensathien&lt;/p&gt;

Spatial heterogeneity in the strength or agents of selection can lead to geographic variation in ecologically important phenotypes. Many dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid toxins from their diets and often exhibit fixed mutations at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, a voltage-gated sodium ion channel associated with alkaloid toxin resistance. Yet previous studies have noted an absence of resistance mutations in individuals from several species known to sequester alkaloid toxins, suggesting possible intraspecific variation for alkaloid resistance in these species. Toxicity and alkaloid profiles vary substantially between populations in several poison frog species (genus &lt;i&gt;Dendrobates&lt;/i&gt;) and are correlated with variation in a suite of related traits such as aposematic coloration. If resistance mutations are costly, due to alterations of channel gating properties, we expect that low toxicity populations will have reduced frequencies and potentially even the loss of resistance alleles. Here, we examine whether intraspecific variation in toxicity in three dendrobatid frogs is associated with intraspecific variation in alleles conferring toxin resistance. Specifically, we examine two species that display marked variation in toxicity throughout their native ranges (&lt;i&gt;Dendrobates pumilio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granuliferus&lt;/i&gt;) and one species with reduced toxicity in its introduced range (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auratus&lt;/i&gt;). However, we find no evidence for population-level variation in alkaloid resistance at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4. In fact, contrary to previous studies, we found that alkaloid resistance alleles were not absent in any populations of these species. All three species exhibit fixed alkaloid resistance mutations throughout their ranges, suggesting that these mutations are maintained even when alkaloid sequestration is substantially reduced.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Michael L.

Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)&gt;14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1). The total weight loss achieved in the maintainers (27 of 73 study participants) two years after the intervention had finished was 6.54 kg (4.47 kg+2.0 kg). The non-maintainers, on the other hand, returned to their initial weight at the start of the intervention (+0.21 kg). In multivariable analysis baseline history of increased glucose (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–13.6) and reduction of total fat in diet during follow-up (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.5–12.2) were independent predictors of successful weight loss. Further studies exploring predictors of weight loss maintenance in diabetes prevention are needed to help health care providers to redesign interventions and improve long-term outcomes of real life interventions.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194589</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51cb:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>a15c8eea</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska, Noël C.

This paper examines the effect of maternal socio-economic status in the household, such as their autonomy, ability, freedom and bargaining power, on child birth registration in India using the nationally representative India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011–12. We have estimated a multilevel mixed effects model which accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data and allows us to examine the effects of unobserved ‘district’ and ‘community’ characteristics along with individual child level characteristics on probability of birth registration. The results show that between-districts and between individuals differences share a considerably high and an almost equal proportion of the variations in probability of birth registration in India. At individual child level, mother’s socio-economic status such as her ability to move around independently and her exposure to outside world, significantly raise the probability of birth registration. More importantly, the marginal effects of the maternal autonomy indicators: mother’s ability to move around freely and her control over resources, on birth registration vary across districts in India. Other variables such as institutional birth, mother’s antenatal care seeking behaviour, caste, religion, household wealth and parental education are significant determinants of birth registration.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Itismita Mohanty</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194095</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d57:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>711e885</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Itismita Mohanty, Tesfaye Alemayehu Gebremedhin&lt;/p&gt;

As the majority of these animals are migratory, their utility to interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of the magnetic sense is limited. Vidal-Gadea and colleagues recently argued that the worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; possesses a magnetic sense that guides their vertical movement in soil.

As the majority of these animals are migratory, their utility to interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of the magnetic sense is limited. Vidal-Gadea and colleagues recently argued that the worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; possesses a magnetic sense that guides their vertical movement in soil. In making this claim, they relied on three different behavioral assays that involved magnetic stimuli.

Genetic modification of Cry-proteins from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)&lt;/i&gt; is a common practice in economically important crops to improve insecticide resistance and reduce the use of pesticides. However, introduction of these genes can have unintended side effects, which should be closely monitored for effective breeding and crop management. To determine the potential cause of these negative effects, we explored assimilate partitioning in the transgenic &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; rice line T1c-19 (&lt;i&gt;Cry1C*&lt;/i&gt;), which was compared with that of its wild-type counterpart Minghui 63 (MH63) under different potassium fertilization application treatment conditions. In a pot experiment, 0, 0.4, and 0.6 g K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was applied per kg of dry soil to determine the phloem transport characteristics of the two rice lines. We used a variety of assessment indicators ranging from morphological to physiological aspects, including the number of large and small vascular bundles in the neck internode at the heading stage, the diameter and bleeding intensity of the neck internode at the filling stage, and the content and apparent ratio of transferred non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in the culm and sheath from the heading to maturing stages. The K utilization and grain yield at the maturing stage were also concerned. Results presented that the mean setting rate and grain yield of T1c-19 (&lt;i&gt;Cry1C*&lt;/i&gt;) decreased by 22.3% and 26.2% compared to those in MH63, respectively. Compared to MH63, the K concentration and accumulation were significantly higher in the culms and leaves, but significantly lower in grain of T1c-19 (&lt;i&gt;Cry1C*&lt;/i&gt;). T1c-19 (&lt;i&gt;Cry1C*&lt;/i&gt;) had less apparent NSC efflux in the culm and sheath, fewer small vascular bundles, and a smaller diameter and bleeding intensity of the neck internode than MH63. In addition, linear correlation analysis indicated that there were positive correlations among grain yield, setting rate, the apparent NSC efflux in the culm and sheath, number of small vascular bundles, and the neck internode diameter and bleeding intensity.

Background &lt;p&gt;The use of iodine-based contrast agents entails the risk of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Radiocontrast agents elicit the third most common cause of nephropathy among hospitalized patients, accounting for 11–12% of cases. CIN is connected with clinically significant consequences, including increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of complications, potential need for dialysis, and increased mortality rate. The number of in-hospital examinations using iodine-based contrast media has been significantly increasing over the last decade. In order to protect patients from possible complications of such examinations, new biomarkers are needed that are able to predict a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Urinary and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations are influenced by renal function. Urinary cGMP is primarily of renal cellular origin. Therefore, we assessed if urinary cGMP concentration may predict major adverse renal events (MARE) after contrast media exposure during coronary angiography.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Urine samples were prospectively collected from non-randomized consecutive patients with either diabetes or preexisting impaired kidney function receiving intra-arterial contrast medium (CM) for emergent or elective coronary angiography at the Charité Campus Mitte, University Hospital Berlin. Urinary cGMP concentration in spot urine was analyzed 24 hours after CM exposure. Patients were followed up over 90 days for occurrence of death, initiation of dialysis, doubling of plasma creatinine concentration or MARE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 289 consecutive patients were included into the study. Urine cGMP/creatinine ratio 24 hours before CM exposure expressed as mean±SD was predictive for the need of dialysis (no dialysis: 89.77±92.85 μM/mM, n = 277; need for dialysis: 140.3±82.90 μM/mM, n = 12, p = 0.008), death (no death during follow-up: 90.60±92.50 μM/mM, n = 280; death during follow-up: 169.88±81.52 μM/mM, n = 9; p = 0.002), and the composite endpoint MARE (no MARE: 86.02±93.17 μM/mM, n = 271; MARE: 146.64±74.68 μM/mM, n = 18, p&amp;lt;0.001) during the follow-up of 90 days after contrast media application. cGMP/creatinine ratio stayed significantly increased at values exceeding 120 μM/mM in patients who developed MARE, required dialysis or died.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary cGMP/creatinine ratio ≥ 120 μM/mM before CM exposure is a promising biomarker for the need of dialysis and all-cause mortality 90 days after CM exposure in patients with preexisting renal impairment or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Lyubov Chaykovska</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195828</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d0:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>76cfb651</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lyubov Chaykovska, Fabian Heunisch, Gina von Einem, Carl-Friedrich Hocher, Oleg Tsuprykov, Mira Pavkovic, Peter Sandner, Axel Kretschmer, Chang Chu, Saban Elitok, Johannes-Peter Stasch, Berthold Hocher&lt;/p&gt;

Since both parameters can be interchangeably assessed with different software solutions they may enter the clinical arena for optimized diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in various pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521061200000</published><title>Inter-vendor reproducibility of left and right ventricular cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature-tracking</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195068</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195068</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195068</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Pasquau, Carmen Hidalgo-Tenorio, María Luisa Montes, Alberto Romero-Palacios, Jorge Vergas, Isabel Sanjoaquín, José Hernández-Quero, Koldo Aguirrebengoa, Francisco Orihuela, Arkaitz Imaz, María José Ríos-Villegas, Juan Flores, María Carmen Fariñas, Pilar Vázquez, María José Galindo, Isabel García-Mercé, Fernando Lozano, Ignacio de los Santos, Samantha Elizabeth de Jesus, Coral García-Vallecillos, on behalf of The QoLKAMON STUDY GROUP &lt;/p&gt;
Trial design &lt;p&gt;The QoLKAMON study evaluated quality of life, efficacy and treatment safety in HIV patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir in monotherapy (MT) versus continuing combined antiretroviral triple treatment with a boosted protease inhibitor (TT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a 24-week, open-label, multicentre study in virologically-suppressed HIV-infected participants (N = 225) with a 2:1 randomization: 146 patients who switched to MT were compared with 79 patients who remained on a TT regimen.

In regards to adherence to therapy and patient satisfaction, some aspects (number of doses forgotten in the last week and satisfaction of treatment measured with the CESTA score, dimension 1) improved significantly with MT.

Tuberculosis places a staggering burden on human health globally. The new World Health Organisation End-TB Strategy has highlighted the urgent need for more effective TB vaccines to improve control of the disease. Protein-based subunit vaccines offer potential as safe and effective generators of protective immunity, and the use of particulate vaccine formulation and delivery by the pulmonary route may enhance local immunogenicity. In this study, novel particulate subunit vaccines were developed utilising biodegradable poly(lactic-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolic acid) (PLGA) slow-release particles as carriers for the &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; lipoprotein MPT83, together with the adjuvants trehalose-dibehenate (TDB) or Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Following delivery by the pulmonary or subcutaneous routes, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccines were assessed in a murine model of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection. When delivered peripherally, these vaccines induced modest, antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 responses, but strong anti-MPT83 antibody responses. Mucosal delivery of the PLGA(MPT83) vaccine, with or without TDB, increased antigen-specific Th17 responses in the lungs, however, PLGA-encapsulated vaccines did not provide protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. By contrast, peripheral delivery of DDA liposomes containing MPT83 and TDB or MPL, stimulated both Th1 and Th17 responses and generated protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. Therefore, PLGA-formulated vaccines primarily stimulate strong humoral immunity, or Th17 responses if used mucosally, and may be a suitable carrier for vaccines against extracellular pathogens. This study emphasises the critical nature of the vaccine carrier, adjuvant and route of delivery for optimising vaccine efficacy against TB.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Anneliese S.

As persons with stroke are surviving longer, monitoring and managing their quality of life is becoming important. We reviewed the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) in order to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in stroke survivors as measured by the Euro Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D), and to find out influencing factors. A total of 42,500 subjects were enrolled in the KNHANES, and 575 of them were persons with stroke. The EQ-5D index was lower in persons with stroke than those without stroke, when adjusted for age and sex (with stroke: 0.757±0.012, without stroke: 0.948±0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .0001). Dimension-specific influencing factors of HRQoL were observed in persons with stroke; mobility problems increased with old age; self-care problems increased with old age and depression; usual activity problems increased with old age, low income, absence of economic activity, and depression; pain/discomfort problems increased with low income. The EQ-5D index was lower in stroke survivors with older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lack of regular exercise. This is the first study to utilize nationally representative data of the Korean population to investigate the effect of stroke on HRQoL and explore the dimension-specific influencing factors. Further development of rehabilitative interventions for post-stroke depression, vocational rehabilitation, and tailored programs for encouraging physical activity may be needed to improve the HRQoL in Korean stroke survivors.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>SuYeon Kwon</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195713</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c0:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>28ddd579</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by SuYeon Kwon, Ji-Hong Park, Won-Seok Kim, Kyungdo Han, Yookyung Lee, Nam-Jong Paik&lt;/p&gt;
As persons with stroke are surviving longer, monitoring and managing their quality of life is becoming important. We reviewed the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) in order to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in stroke survivors as measured by the Euro Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D), and to find out influencing factors. A total of 42,500 subjects were enrolled in the KNHANES, and 575 of them were persons with stroke. The EQ-5D index was lower in persons with stroke than those without stroke, when adjusted for age and sex (with stroke: 0.757±0.012, without stroke: 0.948±0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .0001). Dimension-specific influencing factors of HRQoL were observed in persons with stroke; mobility problems increased with old age; self-care problems increased with old age and depression; usual activity problems increased with old age, low income, absence of economic activity, and depression; pain/discomfort problems increased with low income. The EQ-5D index was lower in stroke survivors with older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lack of regular exercise. This is the first study to utilize nationally representative data of the Korean population to investigate the effect of stroke on HRQoL and explore the dimension-specific influencing factors. Further development of rehabilitative interventions for post-stroke depression, vocational rehabilitation, and tailored programs for encouraging physical activity may be needed to improve the HRQoL in Korean stroke survivors.</description><published>1523394000000</published><title>Health-related quality of life and related factors in stroke survivors: Data from Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2008 to 2014</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-l?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-l?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-l?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521740379000</published><author><name>Ferrarelli, L.

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world’s largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005994</href></item></canonical><engagement>14</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005994</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16272f1be07:b826c:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522346868231</crawled><fingerprint>1848664e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian S.

The speed of theta brain oscillatory activity is thought to play a key role in determining working memory (WM) capacity. Individual differences in the length of a theta cycle (ranging between 4 and 7 Hz) might determine how many gamma cycles (&gt;30 Hz) can be nested into a theta wave. Gamma cycles are thought to represent single memory items; therefore, this interplay could determine individual memory capacity. We directly tested this hypothesis by means of parietal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) set at slower (4 Hz) and faster (7 Hz) theta frequencies during a visuospatial WM paradigm. Accordingly, we found that 4-Hz tACS enhanced WM capacity, while 7-Hz tACS reduced WM capacity. Notably, these effects were found only for items presented to the hemifield contralateral to the stimulation site. This provides causal evidence for a frequency-dependent and spatially specific organization of WM storage, supporting the theta–gamma phase coupling theory of WM capacity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CD9CmLoVDB8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005348</href></item></canonical><engagement>67</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005348</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162259eed6a:493923:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><fingerprint>11c99faa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nina Wolinski, Nicholas R.

Studies disrupting the chemokine pathway CX3CL1 (fractalkine)/ CX3CR1 have shown decreased atherosclerosis in animal models but the techniques used to interrupt the pathway have not been easily translatable into human trials. DNA vaccination potentially overcomes the translational difficulties. We evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine, targeted to CX3CR1, on atherosclerosis in a murine model and examined possible mechanisms of action. DNA vaccination against CX3CR1, enhanced by dendritic cell targeting using DEC-205 single chain variable region fragment (scFv), was performed in 8 week old ApoE-/- mice, fed a normal chow diet. High levels of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies were induced in vaccinated mice. There were no apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine. Arterial vessels of 34 week old mice were examined histologically for atherosclerotic plaque size, macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell infiltration and lipid deposition. Vaccinated mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque in the brachiocephalic artery. There was less macrophage infiltration but no significant change to the macrophage phenotype in the plaques. There was less lipid deposition in the lesions, but there was no effect on smooth muscle cell migration. Targeted DNA vaccination to CX3CR1 was well tolerated, induced a strong immune response and resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesions with reduced macrophage infiltration. DNA vaccination against chemokine pathways potentially offers a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Jimmy Jianheng Zhou</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195657</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3c9:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><fingerprint>4cb30a82</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jimmy Jianheng Zhou, Yuan Min Wang, Vincent W.

Background &lt;p&gt;While silent brain infarcts (SBIs) in screened cohorts are associated with risk of symptomatic stroke and dementia, the clinical significance of incidentally discovered SBIs (id-SBIs) is unknown. Detection may offer an opportunity to initiate prevention measures, but uncertainties about id-SBIs may impede clinicians from addressing them and complicate further study of this condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;This study used semi-structured interviews of practicing clinicians. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. A constant comparative method was used to organize emergent themes and examine new themes. Purposeful sampling was employed to achieve participant diversity. Fifteen clinicians were interviewed. Emergent themes centered on uncertainty about id-SBIs, clinical decision making in response to uncertainty, and evidence needed to resolve uncertainty. All clinicians reported uncertainty about id-SBIs: diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic. Differential responses to uncertainties resulted in practice variation within and between specialties. Diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty discouraged disclosure of imaging findings to patients. Vascular neurologists viewed the prognostic significance of id-SBIs as similar to symptomatic stroke. Therapeutic uncertainty was common, but most participants endorsed using stroke secondary prevention strategies. Regarding future research, all internists indicated they would consider changing practices in response to observational studies, whereas half of the neurologists expressed reluctance to modify practices based on non-randomized data. Several expressed concerns about clinical trial feasibility and lack of equipoise.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;id-SBIs are a focus of uncertainty for clinicians, leading to practice variation.

Although several studies have demonstrated a potential correlation of dietary patterns with cognitive function, the relationship between tooth loss and dietary patterns and cognitive function have not been identified. In this cross-sectional study, we used a reduced rank regression (RRR) analysis, a technique used previously to observe dietary patterns based on the intakes of nutrients or levels of biomarkers associated with the condition of interest, to identify tooth loss-related dietary patterns and investigate the associations of such patterns with cognitive impairment in 334 community-dwelling Japanese subjects aged ≥ 60 years. According to Pearson correlation coefficients, the intakes of six nutrients (ash content, sodium, zinc, vitamin B1, α- and β-carotene) correlated significantly with the number of remaining teeth. Using RRR analysis, we extracted four dietary patterns in our subject population that explained 86.67% of the total variation in the intakes of these six nutrients. Particularly, dietary pattern 1 (DP1) accounted for 52.2% of the total variation. Food groups with factor loadings of ≥ 0.2 included pickled green leafy vegetables, lettuce/cabbage, green leaves vegetables, cabbage, carrots/squash; by contrast, rice had a factor loading of &amp;lt;−0.2. In a multivariate regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratios regarding the prevalence of cognitive impairment for the lowest, middle and highest tertiles of the DP1 score were 1.00 (reference), 1.224 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.611–2.453) and 0.427 (95% CI: 0.191–0.954), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that tooth loss-related dietary patterns are associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment. These results may motivate changes in dental treatment and the dietary behaviours and thereby lower the risk of cognitive impairment.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Mai Ishimiya</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194504</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a626:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>9a28d4ea</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Ishimiya, Hiroyuki Nakamura, Yutaka Kobayashi, Moeko Noguchi-Shinohara, Chiemi Abe, Chiaki Dohmoto, Yoshihisa Ikeda, Kahori Tokuno, Kazuhiro Ooi, Masami Yokokawa, Kazuo Iwasa, Kiyonobu Komai, Shuichi Kawashiri, Masahito Yamada&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;HIV-1 dual infection is a condition that results from infection with at least two HIV-1 variants from different sources. The scarceness of information on this condition is partly due to the fact that its detection is technically challenging. Using next-generation sequencing we defined the extent of HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM).&lt;/p&gt; Material &amp;amp; methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six MSM, diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B infection between 2008 and 2013 were selected for next-generation sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;envelope&lt;/i&gt; V3. Sequencing was performed on 2 plasma samples collected with an interval of &gt; 6 months before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inspected for dual infection, defined as the presence of two or more monophyletic clusters with ≥ 90% bootstrap support and a mean between-cluster genetic distance of ≥ 10%.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;HIV-1 dual infection is a condition that results from infection with at least two HIV-1 variants from different sources. The scarceness of information on this condition is partly due to the fact that its detection is technically challenging. Using next-generation sequencing we defined the extent of HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM).&lt;/p&gt; Material &amp;amp; methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six MSM, diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B infection between 2008 and 2013 were selected for next-generation sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;envelope&lt;/i&gt; V3. Sequencing was performed on 2 plasma samples collected with an interval of &gt; 6 months before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inspected for dual infection, defined as the presence of two or more monophyletic clusters with ≥ 90% bootstrap support and a mean between-cluster genetic distance of ≥ 10%. To confirm dual infection, deep V3 sequencing of intermediate samples was performed as well as clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;protease-reverse transcriptase&lt;/i&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five of the 74 patients (6.8%) for whom deep sequencing was successful, showed clear evidence of dual infection. In 4 of them, the second strain was absent in the first sample but occurred in subsequent samples. This was highly suggestive for superinfection.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive weakness of the skeletal and cardiac muscles. This X-linked disorder is caused by open reading frame disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in strong reduction or complete absence of dystrophin protein. In order to use dystrophin as a supportive or even surrogate biomarker in clinical studies on investigational drugs aiming at correcting the primary cause of the disease, the ability to reliably quantify dystrophin expression in muscle biopsies of DMD patients pre- and post-treatment is essential. Here we demonstrate the application of the ProteinSimple capillary immunoassay (Wes) method, a gel- and blot-free method requiring less sample, antibody and time to run than conventional Western blot assay. We optimized dystrophin quantification by Wes using 2 different antibodies and found it to be highly sensitive, reproducible and quantitative over a large dynamic range. Using a healthy control muscle sample as a reference and α-actinin as a protein loading/muscle content control, a panel of skeletal muscle samples consisting of 31 healthy controls, 25 Becker Muscle dystrophy (BMD) and 17 DMD samples was subjected to Wes analysis. In healthy controls dystrophin levels varied 3 to 5-fold between the highest and lowest muscle samples, with the reference sample representing the average of all 31 samples. In BMD muscle samples dystrophin levels ranged from 10% to 90%, with an average of 33% of the healthy muscle average, while for the DMD samples the average dystrophin level was 1.3%, ranging from 0.7% to 7% of the healthy muscle average. In conclusion, Wes is a suitable, efficient and reliable method for quantification of dystrophin expression as a biomarker in DMD clinical drug development.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Chantal Beekman</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195850</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d8:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><fingerprint>980c2f6c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chantal Beekman, Anneke A.

Phycobilisomes (PBS) are accessory light harvesting protein complexes formed mainly by phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The PBPs absorb light that is efficiently transferred to Photosystems due to chromophores covalently bound to specific cysteine residues. Besides phycobiliproteins (PE), the PBS contains linker proteins responsible for assembly and stabilization of the whole complex and the tuning of energy transfer steps between chromophores. The linker (γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria chilensis&lt;/i&gt;, is a chromophorylated rod linker associated to (αβ)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; hexamers of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE). Its role in the energy transfer process is not clear yet. Structural studies as well as the composition and location of the chromophores are essential to understand their involvement in the energy transfer process in PBS. To achieve this, the coding gene of γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was analyzed by informatics tools, to obtain preliminary information which leaded the next experiments. The protein was purified from R-phycoerythrin, and the sequence confirmed by mass spectrometry. The coding sequence analysis revealed a protein of 318 aminoacid residues containing a chloroplastidial transit peptide (cTP) of 39 aminoacids at the N-terminus. The conservation of cysteines revealed possible chromophorylation sites. Using α and β R-PE subunits as spectroscopic probes in denaturation assays, we deduced a double bonded phycourobilin (PUB) on γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; subunit that were confirmed between Cys62 and Cys73 (DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;62/73&lt;/sup&gt;) by mass spectrometry. The cysteines involved in the double link are located in a helical region, in a conformation that reminds the position of the DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;50/61&lt;/sup&gt; in the β subunit of R-PE. The position of single linked PUB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt; and a single linked PEB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; were also confirmed.

This thought came to mind yesterday when (on Twitter) Ash Jogalekar quoted a biotech veteran &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/curiouswavefn/status/973661412789837827&quot;&gt;as saying&lt;/a&gt; that the most likely result of a high-throughput screening campaign was nothing and that the second most likely result was crap. Michael Gilman (biotech veteran himself) then &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michael_gilman/status/973678357287260161&quot;&gt;chimed in&lt;/a&gt; to say that he would definitely prefer the “nothing”, because digging through all the crap was so deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can endorse both of those viewpoints, but I wanted to add some refinements. First off, it’s actually pretty unusual to get flat-out nothing from a screen. In fact, a real blank would strongly suggest that something went wrong, because you always get some sort of result, even if it’s just noise. That’s why any new screening campaign generally starts off with a test set, X hundred or X thousand compounds that get run as a pilot. If the output is flat zero for every well, something is very likely wrong. On the other end of the scale, if you get a 10% solid hit rate, something is definitely wrong. A more believable raw hit rate is something below 1% for a lot of targets (more if you’re screening a target class that you know the test deck has liked in the past, of course). But a ten per cent hit rate for what’s supposed to be a randomish selection of compounds is just not going to happen; your assay window is too wide or your assay format is just messed up at a fundamental level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing” in screening terms generally means “nothing more than the usual crap”. Every assay technique is vulnerable to false positives. Some of these are specific to a particular readout – intrinsically fluorescent compounds or fluorescence interfering ones, for example, and some of them (aggregation) can mess up a whole range of assays. You should, then, expect to see your old friends. If you’re running a luciferase-driven assay, for example, you surely have some luciferase inhibitors in your collection (every collection has some!) If they don’t show up as “hits”, you have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about an assay that returns a few hundred compounds even after the frequent-hitters for that assay technique have been identified? That is the situation I described in the opening paragraph, because that’s research, because you have no idea if those compounds are legitimate hits or if they’re a pile of junk that was generated by a false positive mechanism that you don’t know about yet. The newer and more exciting the assay technique, the greater the chances are that this has happened. The wilder and more squirrely the target, the greater the chances for false positives, too, since the intrinsic hit rate is likely quite small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kicker is that wilder and trickier targets tend to get screened in newer or more complex assay formats and against weirder compound collections, because they’ve either already been tried in the more normal stuff or there’s nothing else that has a hope of working. So you’re getting it from both directions. But your only choice is to start working your way through the pile, because that’s what you came here for, right? To find a drug lead? This is the situation that Gilman is describing – weeks or even months of chasing things down class by class, compound by compound. Slam the doors, kick the tires, do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another problem that occurs more often at the frontier, too: lack of control compounds. You would like to test your assay(s) with a compound that’s known to do what you’re looking for, to make sure that everything’s working and that you can find such things, but what if no such compounds exist yet? You’re left trying to develop assays in the hopes that they’ll do what you want – I mean, they &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like they should work – but you’re never quite sure. In these cases, if all you get is a collection of odds and ends when you run the screen, is that because it’s a hard target and not much was going to show up anyway? Or is it because there’s something wrong with your screen? These are, sadly, not mutually exclusive. Positive controls and validated assays have got to come from somewhere, though. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Are we doing this right?” feeling does not go away after the screen, either – in fact, dealing with it is an important part of being able to do research. Have you picked the right compound series to expand on, or is it a dead end that needs to be abandoned? Are you screening in the appropriate cell lines? How about that &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; model that you’re heading for – do you trust it? You’re going to have to trust something at that level, because that’s what’s going to recommend a compound to the clinic. Oh God, the clinic. Is the whole idea behind the project even sound enough to have effects in humans? The Phase II failure rate will show that the answer to this question is often “Nope”, and many of those folks thought they’d answered their questions as well as they could, too, before the ground truth landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, in the end, only one way to answer such questions and deal with such doubts: &lt;em&gt;run the flippin’ experiments&lt;/em&gt;. Set them up as well as you can, with all the brainpower and effort you can bring to the task, and then run the experiments and see what you get. There are plenty of jobs where you know what’s going to happen, but you chose this one instead!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here’s a thing about research (and drug discovery in particular) that makes it a bit different from many other occupations: you can go for extended periods without even being sure that you’re doing what you’re supposed to be doing.

The regulatory role of miRNAs has been explored in ovarian cells, and their effects on gonadal development, apoptosis, ovulation, steroid production and corpus luteum (CL) development have been revealed. In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-29b at different stages of bovine CL development and predicted the target genes of miR-29b. We confirmed that miR-29b reduces the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), affects progesterone (PROG) secretion and regulates the function of the CL. RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b was significantly higher in functional CL phases than in the regressed CL phase. Immunohistochemistry showed that OXTR was expressed in both large and small CL cells and was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of these cells. We analyzed the expression levels of OXTR and found that transfection with a miR-29b mimic decreased OXTR expression, but transfection with the inhibitor had a limited effect on the expression of the OXTR protein. At the same time, the secretion of PROG was significantly increased in the miR-29b mimic-transfected group. We also analyzed the effect of miR-29b on the apoptosis of CL cells. Finally, we found that miR-29b could promote the proliferation of bovine CL cells. In conclusion, we found that miR-29b reduces the expression of OXTR and can promote PROG secretion and the proliferation of CL cells via OXTR.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Ming-Qiang Xu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ecc:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><fingerprint>b880d74f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ming-Qiang Xu, Hao Jiang, Li-Qun Zhang, Xu-Lei Sun, Dan Luo, Yao Fu, Yan Gao, Bao Yuan, Jia-Bao Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Inequalities in health among groups of various socio-economic status (as measured by education, occupation, and income) constitute one of the main challenges for public health. Since 2006, the Lazio Regional Outcome Evaluation Program (P.Re.Val.E.), presents a set of indicators of hospital performance based on quality standards driven by strong clinical recommendations, and measures the variation in the access to effective health care for different population groups and providers in the Lazio Region. One of the aims of the program was to compare population subgroups in order to promote equity in service provision. Since June 2013, a new management strategy has been put in place that assigned specific goals based on performance assessment to the chief executive officers of the hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether, in recent years, there has been a reduction in the differential access to effective health care, among individuals with different educational levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We enrolled all patients discharged from both public and private hospitals of the Lazio region between 2012 and 2015, living in Lazio region. We analysed the proportion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes (primary PCI), the proportion of patients with hip fracture (HF) who underwent surgery within 2 days, and the proportion of women with primary C-section. We applied multivariate logistic regression models to assess the effect of educational level on health outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities that could affect the outcomes. For each year of the study period, we compared adjusted proportions of outcomes for the highest and the lowest level of education by using percentage differences.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, 44.6% of STEMI patients (N = 3,299) were treated with primary PCI, 54.4% of patients with hip fractures (N = 6,602) underwent surgery within 2 days, and 27.7% of women without a previous C-section (N = 34,718) delivered via C-section, in 2015. The corresponding proportions in 2012 were 27.8%, 31.3% and 31.5%, respectively. By comparing the adjusted proportions in patients with the highest education level (a university degree or higher) to those with the lowest level education level (None/Primary school), a decrease in the percentage difference was observed during the study period. In STEMI and delivery cohorts, the improvement of outcomes involved the least and the most educated patients, respectively, and the difference between the two educational levels was close to zero in 2015, whereas for hip patients, the improvement was more evident among the less educated patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, we observed a reduction in the differential access to effective heath care by educational level, in different clinical areas. Different factors might explain these results. On top of the public disclosure of outcome data, the management strategy applied in mid-2013 might have driven the overall improvement of the health system for the considered conditions, helping to achieve a fairer access to health.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Martina Ventura</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194972</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>bf9aff61</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Ventura, Danilo Fusco, Katia Bontempi, Paola Colais, Marina Davoli&lt;/p&gt;

In our study we examined postural performance of young healthy persons (HY), elderly healthy persons (HE), and elderly persons at high risk of falling (FR). Anterio-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) ankle and hip angular deviations, as well as linear displacements of the center of mass (COM) were assessed in persons standing with eyes either open or closed, while none, and 40 and 30 Hz vibrations were applied bilaterally to the ankle muscle gastrocnemius. During quiet standing with eyes open, balance parameters in FR group differed from those in healthy groups. ML ankle and hip angular deviations, as well as COM linear displacements were noticeably larger in FR group. During quiet standing with eyes closed, all balance parameters in participants of all groups had a clear trend to increase. During standing with eyes open, 40 Hz vibration increased all but one balance parameter within HY group, ankle angular deviations in HE group, but none in FR group. In response to 30 Hz vibration, only ankle angular deviations and COM linear displacements increased in HY group. There were no changes in both elderly groups. During standing with eyes closed, 40 and 30 Hz vibrations did not produce consistent changes in balance parameters in HY and HE groups. In FR persons, 40 Hz vibration did not change balance parameters. However, in FR groups, 30 Hz vibration decreased ankle and hip angular deviations, and COM linear displacements. The major result of the study is a finding that low intensity vibration of ankle muscles makes balance better in elderly persons at high risk of falling. This result is clinically relevant because it suggests that applying mild vibration to ankle muscles while standing and walking might benefit elderly persons, improving their postural performance and reducing a risk of unexpected falls.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Nima Toosizadeh</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194720</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f5:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>1fc43bf4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nima Toosizadeh, Jane Mohler, Vladimir Marlinski&lt;/p&gt;

Fungal spores and mycelium fragments are particles which become and remain airborne and have been subjects of aerobiological studies.

We investigate the influence of the visual appearance of a negotiator on persuasiveness within the context of negotiations. Psychological experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between visual appearance and the use of language. Male and female participants were shown three female and male photographs, respectively. They were asked to report how they felt about each photograph using a seven-point semantic differential (SD) scale for six affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness). Participants then answered how they felt about each negotiation scenario (they were presented with pictures and a situation combined with negotiation sentences) using a seven-point SD scale for seven affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and degree of persuasion). Two experiments were conducted using different participant groups depending on the negotiation situations. Photographs with good or bad appearances were found to show high or low degrees of persuasion, respectively. A multiple regression equation was obtained, indicating the importance of the three language factors (euphemistic, honorific, and sympathy expressions) to impressions made during negotiation. The result shows that there are optimal negotiation sentences based on various negotiation factors, such as visual appearance and use of language. For example, persons with good appearance might worsen their impression during negotiations by using certain language, although their initial impression was positive, and persons with bad appearance could effectively improve their impressions in negotiations through their use of language, although the final impressions of their negotiation counterpart might still be more negative than those for persons with good appearance.

We investigate the influence of the visual appearance of a negotiator on persuasiveness within the context of negotiations. Psychological experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between visual appearance and the use of language. Male and female participants were shown three female and male photographs, respectively. They were asked to report how they felt about each photograph using a seven-point semantic differential (SD) scale for six affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness). Participants then answered how they felt about each negotiation scenario (they were presented with pictures and a situation combined with negotiation sentences) using a seven-point SD scale for seven affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and degree of persuasion). Two experiments were conducted using different participant groups depending on the negotiation situations. Photographs with good or bad appearances were found to show high or low degrees of persuasion, respectively. A multiple regression equation was obtained, indicating the importance of the three language factors (euphemistic, honorific, and sympathy expressions) to impressions made during negotiation. The result shows that there are optimal negotiation sentences based on various negotiation factors, such as visual appearance and use of language. For example, persons with good appearance might worsen their impression during negotiations by using certain language, although their initial impression was positive, and persons with bad appearance could effectively improve their impressions in negotiations through their use of language, although the final impressions of their negotiation counterpart might still be more negative than those for persons with good appearance. In contrast, the impressions made by persons of normal appearance were not easily affected by their use of language. The results of the present study have significant implications for future studies of effective negotiation strategies considering visual appearance as well as gender.</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>Optimal linguistic expression in negotiations depends on visual appearance</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022264?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022264?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022264?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1521694876000</published><author><name>Nikolai F.

While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown.

We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels.

Sphingolipids are a diverse group of lipids with important roles in beta-cell biology regulating insulin folding and controlling apoptosis. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins with the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA. Here we tested the effect of L-serine supplementation on autoimmune diabetes development and blood glucose homeostasis in female NOD mice. We found that continuous supplementation of L-serine reduces diabetes incidence and insulitis score. In addition, L-serine treated mice had an improved glucose tolerance test, reduced HOMA-IR, and reduced blood glucose levels. L-serine led to a small reduction in body weight accompanied by reduced food and water intake. L-serine had no effect on pancreatic sphingolipids as measured by mass spectrometry. The data thus suggests that L-serine could be used as a therapeutic supplement in the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes and to improve blood glucose homeostasis.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Laurits J.

Microbiome science is revealing that the phenotype and health of animals, including humans, depend on the sustained function of their resident microorganisms. In this essay, I argue for thoughtful choice of model systems for human microbiome science. A greater variety of experimental systems, including wider use of invertebrate models, would benefit biomedical research, while systems ill-suited to experimental and genetic manipulation can be used to address very limited sets of scientific questions. Microbiome science benefits from the coordinated use of multiple systems, which is facilitated by networks of researchers with expertise in different experimental systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hcSqNJvl82E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005245</href></item></canonical><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005245</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1623f5d8af8:1577ee3:76251cdd</id><crawled>1521481517816</crawled><fingerprint>9b5e7e9b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angela E.

Microbiome science benefits from the coordinated use of multiple systems, which is facilitated by networks of researchers with expertise in different experimental systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hcSqNJvl82E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1521482288690</recrawled><published>1521493200000</published><title>Which experimental systems should we use for human microbiome science?</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1317?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1317?rss=1</link><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521740378000</published><author><name>Clery, D.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1317.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:4150414:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1317?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>3681d9e5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Scientific Community</item></keywords><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Stephen Hawking, betting man</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03346-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Experiments that ask children to draw a scientist show a greater proportion of women in sketches over time.</content></content><published>1521529200000</published><author><name>Giorgia Guglielmi</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>2678</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16241a886ae:2b6101c:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521519986350</crawled><fingerprint>8a5a1aad</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03346-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03346-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Experiments that ask children to draw a scientist show a greater proportion of women in sketches over time.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03346-7/d41586-018-03346-7_15545078.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>US kids’ doodles of scientists reveal changing gender stereotypes</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022494?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022494?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022494?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522737048000</published><author><name>K.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Demographic change has led to an increase of older people in need of long-term care in nearly all European countries. Informal carers primarily provide the care and support needed by dependent people. The supply and willingness of individuals to act as carers are critical to sustain informal care resources as part of the home health care provision. This paper describes a longitudinal study of informal care in six European countries and reports analyses that determine those factors predicting the outcomes of family care over a one-year period.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Analyses are based on data from the EUROFAMCARE project, a longitudinal survey study of family carers of older people with baseline data collection in 2004 and follow-up data collection a year later in six European countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), N = 3,348. Descriptive statistics of the sample characteristics are reported. Binary logistic random-intercept regressions were computed, predicting the outcome of change of the care dyad’s status at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Where care is provided by a more distant family member or by a friend or neighbour, the care-recipient is significantly more likely to be cared for by someone else (OR 1.62) or to be in residential care (OR 3.37) after one year. The same holds true if the care-recipient has memory problems with a dementia diagnosis (OR 1.79/OR 1.84). Higher dependency (OR 1.22) and behavioural problems (OR 1.76) in the care-recipient also lead to a change of care dyad status. Country of residence explained a relatively small amount of variance (8%) in whether a care-recipient was cared for by someone else after one year, but explained a substantial amount of variance (52%) in whether a care-recipient was in residential care. Particularly in Sweden, care-recipients are much more likely to be cared for by another family or professional carer or to be in residential care, whereas in Greece the status of the care dyad is much less likely to change.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The majority of family carers continued to provide care to their respective older relatives over a one-year period, despite often high levels of functional, cognitive and behavioural problems in the care-recipient. Those family carers could benefit most from appropriate support. The carer/care-recipient relationship plays an important role in whether or not a family care dyad remains intact over a one-year period. The support of health and social care services should be particularly targeted toward those care dyads where there is no partner or spouse acting as carer, or no extended family network that might absorb the caring role when required. Distant relatives, friends or acquaintances who are acting as carers might need substantial intervention if their caregiving role is to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Daniel Lüdecke</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195294</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f60:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>f6f92326</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Lüdecke, Barbara Bien, Kevin McKee, Barbro Krevers, Elizabeth Mestheneos, Mirko Di Rosa, Olaf von dem Knesebeck, Christopher Kofahl&lt;/p&gt;

The necrophilous insect fauna on carcasses varies seasonally and geographically. The ecological succession of insects arriving to decaying neonate pig carcasses in central North Carolina during late summer was sampled using a novel vented-chamber collection method. We collected six blow fly species, flesh flies, house flies and 10 beetle taxa, including four species of scarab beetles. Necrophilous fly activity dominated the early decomposition stages, whereas beetle numbers remained low until day 4. By day 7, more than 50% of the pig carcasses were skeletonized and they attracted few insects. Differences in the taxa and successional patterns documented in this experiment and a previous study in the same location highlight the ecological variation in such investigations, and underscore the need for standardization, as well as for ecological succession studies on finer geographic scales.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Angela Cruise</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195785</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c9:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>a27e7783</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angela Cruise, David W.

Increasing evidence indicates that the Golgi apparatus plays active roles in cancer, but a comprehensive understanding of its functions in the oncogenic transformation has not yet emerged. At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipid biosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, we analyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. We disrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as in increased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin D or Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Charlotte Luchsinger</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195401</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6f:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>4838f225</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charlotte Luchsinger, Marcelo Aguilar, Patricia V.

Anthocyanins are naturally active substances. In this study, anthocyanins from black rice were obtained by membrane filtration and column chromatography separation. Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products.

Anthocyanins are naturally active substances. In this study, anthocyanins from black rice were obtained by membrane filtration and column chromatography separation. Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, not only the pH of the media containing C3G was lower than that of the extract of black rice anthocyanin (BRAE), but the numbers of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were also significantly increased. Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.

Cadmium exposure can cause renal tubular dysfunction. Recent studies show that vitamin D can play multiple roles in the body. However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium. A total of 133 subjects living in control area and two cadmium polluted areas were included in the present study. Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D ≥ 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1–0.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1–1.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D &amp;lt; 30 ng/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed in those subjects living in cadmium polluted areas or with high level of UCd or BCd. Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Xiao Chen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195682</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9be:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>2c4ab63a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiao Chen, Yan Dai, Zhongqiu Wang, Guoying Zhu, Xiaoqiang Ding, Taiyi Jin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 (-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651). For every willingness-to-pay threshold, the incremental net monetary benefits did not significantly differ from zero.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The longer-term treatments were similar with regard to costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared to shorter-term treatment in patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms after one year of follow-up.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) often experience abnormal facial growth. Three-dimensional (3D) assessment of dentofacial growth deviation has become more common with advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies. However, no standardized guidelines exist for interpretation of 3D imaging in patients with JIA. The aim of this study was to propose and validate morphometric measures for the 3D radiographic assessment of dentofacial growth deviation in patients with JIA to enhance: 1) Description of dentofacial growth deviation; 2) Treatment planning; 3) Longitudinal follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in a standardized sequential-phased approach involving: 1) Preliminary decision-making; 2) Item generation; 3) Test of content-validity; 4) Test of reliability; 5) Test of construct validity; 6) Establishment of final recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one morphometric measures were evaluated.

The annual return of beluga whales, &lt;i&gt;Delphinapterus leucas&lt;/i&gt;, to traditional seasonal locations across the Arctic may involve migratory culture, while the convergence of discrete summering aggregations on common wintering grounds may facilitate outbreeding. Natal philopatry and cultural inheritance, however, has been difficult to assess as earlier studies were of too short a duration, while genetic analyses of breeding patterns, especially across the beluga’s Pacific range, have been hampered by inadequate sampling and sparse information on wintering areas. Using a much expanded sample and genetic marker set comprising 1,647 whales, spanning more than two decades and encompassing all major coastal summering aggregations in the Pacific Ocean, we found evolutionary-level divergence among three geographic regions: the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, and the Sea of Okhotsk (&lt;i&gt;Φ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.11–0.32, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.09–0.13), and likely demographic independence of (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-mtDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.02–0.66), and in many cases limited gene flow (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-nDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0–0.02; &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; = 5–6) among, summering groups within regions. Assignment tests identified few immigrants within summering aggregations, linked migrating groups to specific summering areas, and found that some migratory corridors comprise whales from multiple subpopulations (P&lt;sub&gt;BAYES&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.31:0.69). Further, dispersal is male-biased and substantial numbers of closely related whales congregate together at coastal summering areas. Stable patterns of heterogeneity between areas and consistently high proportions (~20%) of close kin (including parent-offspring) sampled up to 20 years apart within areas (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; = 0.2–2.9, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.5) is the first direct evidence of natal philopatry to migration destinations in belugas.

First off, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/17/approvals-and-otherwise-in-oncology&quot;&gt;this 2015 post&lt;/a&gt; mentions the steep drop in shares of Clovis Biotechnology, brought on by a rather sudden revision in the announced clinical performance of their lead drug (the covalent kinase inhibitor rociletinib). Well, it appears that the SEC found this to be rather abrupt as well, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/more-than-2-years-after-the-ugly-roci-debacle-clovis-says-that-the-sec-is-prepping-civil-charges/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endpts&lt;/em&gt; now reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company has been under investigation. Some of their investors have long claimed that the presentation of the clinical data had been manipulated in order to keep the company’s stock price up, and it looks like that theory is getting a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth remembering the different time scales involved. Think of the different parts of a cell: you get fast service from receptors and second-messenger systems (starting on a time scale of less than a second), but if you’re waiting for proteins to be synthesized, you need to come back in a few hours. Likewise the stock market reacts pretty quickly to bad news (Clovis got sold off on that news as if the shares were giving off radon gas), but the regulatory authorities are much slower. That said, they’re also pretty hard to dislodge once they get a fix on your position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the markets can take a while to react to things, too, because it’s differences of opinion that make them work in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/07/30/another_alzheimers_ipo&quot;&gt;Here’s another post&lt;/a&gt; from 2015 where I wrote about the IPO of a company (vTv Therapeutics, formerly TransTech) trying to make a go of it with a retread Alzheimer’s therapy. The comparison with Axovant was obvious at the time, and some readers will recall &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/09/27/bad-news-but-not-the-unexpected-kind&quot;&gt;what eventually happened to them&lt;/a&gt; when their own drug failed yet again in an Alzheimer’s trial. As that post mentioned, I was short Axovant stock when that took place (an event that financed the purchase of a new 18-inch Dobsonian telescope around here). Well, vTv &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xconomy.com/raleigh-durham/2018/04/09/with-alzheimers-failure-vtv-fares-no-better-than-old-partner-pfizer/&quot;&gt;announced their own clinical trial results&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, and to no one’s particular surprise, the compound failed for them, just as it had for Pfizer back in the day when TransTech had licensed it to them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s stock had been up over $7 earlier in the year, on what I thought was rather misplaced optimism. I sold them short in January at $7.42, and have been careful not to write about them in any way since doing so (in fact, I haven’t mentioned them at all since that 2015 post). VTVT &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/vtvt?p=vtvt&quot;&gt;had been dropping&lt;/a&gt; since then, and was back down in the $3 range before they announced this news, but that failed trial sent them down steeply. At that point I naturally covered my position, which is one reason I mention it now. The stock is trading this morning at about $0.67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know, if someone else comes along with a drug that’s already failed one or two Alzheimer’s trials, I’m very likely to short them, too. One of these days some odd AD mechanism is (I hope) going to work, but given the odds of clinical success, financing things like Axovant’s or vTv’s drugs that have &lt;em&gt;already failed in the clinic&lt;/em&gt; seems like a bad idea. And that’s the other reason I’m bringing up my short sales of these companies: I (and the other people who were also short these outfits) should actually not be handed such opportunities. Axovant and vTv should not, in a more rational market, have been able to go public as blithely as they did with the assets that they had, and their market caps should not have achieved what heights they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great time to finance small biopharma companies (and here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LifeSciVC/status/983763134090530816&quot;&gt;a series of Twitter posts&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Booth with some good advice on that subject). But with all this money sloshing around, some of it (as always under these conditions) is going into some rather stupid ideas. &lt;em&gt;Caveat investor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here are some sequels to stories I’ve written about here, things that have had some new chapters added to them.

Numerous factors affect how people choose a fine dining restaurant, including food quality, service quality, food safety, and hedonic value. A conceptual framework for evaluating restaurant selection behavior has not yet been developed. This study surveyed 150 individuals with fine dining experience and proposed the use of mental accounting and axiomatic design to construct a consumer economic behavior model. Linear and logistic regressions were employed to determine model correlations and the probability of each factor affecting behavior. The most crucial factor was food quality, followed by service and dining motivation, particularly regarding family dining. Safe ingredients, high cooking standards, and menu innovation all increased the likelihood of consumers choosing fine dining restaurants.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Sheng-Hsun Hsu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194886</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd7d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>773d0fd3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sheng-Hsun Hsu, Cheng-Fu Hsiao, Sang-Bing Tsai&lt;/p&gt;

However, most WF-management software packages require for their operation at least some programming expertise. Here we describe NeatSeq-Flow, a platform that enables users with no programming knowledge to design and execute complex high throughput sequencing WFs. This is achieved by using a compendium of pre-built modules as well as a generic module, both do not require programming expertise. Nonetheless, NeatSeq-Flow retains the flexibility to generate sophisticated WF modules using templates and only basic Python programming abilities. NeatSeq-Flow is designed to enable easy sharing of WFs and modules by conceptually separating modules, WF design, sample information and execution. Moreover, NeatSeq-Flow works hand in hand with CONDA environments for easy installation of the WF&apos;s analysis programs in one go. NeatSeq-Flow enables efficient WF execution on computer clusters by parallelizing on both samples and WF steps.

However, most WF-management software packages require for their operation at least some programming expertise. Here we describe NeatSeq-Flow, a platform that enables users with no programming knowledge to design and execute complex high throughput sequencing WFs. This is achieved by using a compendium of pre-built modules as well as a generic module, both do not require programming expertise. Nonetheless, NeatSeq-Flow retains the flexibility to generate sophisticated WF modules using templates and only basic Python programming abilities. NeatSeq-Flow is designed to enable easy sharing of WFs and modules by conceptually separating modules, WF design, sample information and execution. Moreover, NeatSeq-Flow works hand in hand with CONDA environments for easy installation of the WF&apos;s analysis programs in one go. NeatSeq-Flow enables efficient WF execution on computer clusters by parallelizing on both samples and WF steps. NeatSeq-Flow operates by shell-script generation; thus it allows full transparency of the WF process. NeatSeq-Flow offers real-time WF execution monitoring, detailed documentation and self-sustaining WF backups for reproducibility. All of these features make NeatSeq-Flow an easy-to-use WF platform while not compromising for flexibility, reproducibility, transparency and efficiency.</description><published>1522047600000</published><title>NeatSeq-Flow: A Lightweight High Throughput Sequencing Workflow Platform for Non-Programmers and Programmers alike [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194493</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194493</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194493</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Barnabas Ohst, Brunna Tuschen-Caffier&lt;/p&gt;
The catastrophic misinterpretation model of panic disorder (PD) predicts that the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations is a distinctive characteristic of PD. Existing research on this prediction has produced mixed findings. This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the strength of catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations and external events in patients with PD, patients with other anxiety disorders, and healthy controls. Following a systematic screening, seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. For the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations, analyses showed medium to large effects between patients with PD and healthy controls and between patients with PD and patients with other anxiety disorders. For the catastrophic misinterpretation of external events, analyses showed medium to large effects between patients with PD and healthy controls and a small negative effect between patients with PD and patients with other anxiety disorders. The findings support the assumption that the catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations is a distinctive characteristic of panic disorder and thus lend support to the catastrophic misinterpretation model of PD.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Barnabas Ohst</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194493</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37ac:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>3a161bdd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Barnabas Ohst, Brunna Tuschen-Caffier&lt;/p&gt;

We present a fast, robust and parsimonious approach to detecting signals in an ordered sequence of numbers. Our motivation is in seeking a suitable method to take a sequence of scores corresponding to properties of positions in virus genomes, and find outlying regions of low scores. Suitable statistical methods without using complex models or making many assumptions are surprisingly lacking. We resolve this by developing a method that detects regions of low score within sequences of real numbers. The method makes no assumptions &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; about the length of such a region; it gives the explicit location of the region and scores it statistically. It does not use detailed mechanistic models so the method is fast and will be useful in a wide range of applications. We present our approach in detail, and test it on simulated sequences. We show that it is robust to a wide range of signal morphologies, and that it is able to capture multiple signals in the same sequence. Finally we apply it to viral genomic data to identify regions of evolutionary conservation within influenza and rotavirus.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Julia R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Spreadsheet software is increasingly used to implement systems science models informing health policy decisions, both in academia and in practice where technical capacity may be limited. However, spreadsheet models are prone to unintentional errors that may not always be identified using standard error-checking techniques. Our objective was to illustrate, through a methodologic case study analysis, the impact of unintentional errors on model projections by implementing parallel model versions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We leveraged a real-world need to revise an existing spreadsheet model designed to inform HIV policy. We developed three parallel versions of a previously validated spreadsheet-based model; versions differed by the spreadsheet cell-referencing approach (named single cells; column/row references; named matrices). For each version, we implemented three model revisions (re-entry into care; guideline-concordant treatment initiation; immediate treatment initiation). After standard error-checking, we identified unintentional errors by comparing model output across the three versions. Concordant model output across all versions was considered error-free. We calculated the impact of unintentional errors as the percentage difference in model projections between model versions with and without unintentional errors, using +/-5% difference to define a material error.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified 58 original and 4,331 propagated unintentional errors across all model versions and revisions. Over 40% (24/58) of original unintentional errors occurred in the column/row reference model version; most (23/24) were due to incorrect cell references. Overall, &gt;20% of model spreadsheet cells had material unintentional errors. When examining error impact along the HIV care continuum, the percentage difference between versions with and without unintentional errors ranged from +3% to +16% (named single cells), +26% to +76% (column/row reference), and 0% (named matrices).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Standard error-checking techniques may not identify all errors in spreadsheet-based models.

Prediction of clinical staging is vital to implement optimal therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction in cancer patients. However, to date, no method has been developed for predicting stage of LIHC from genomic profile of samples. Results: In current study, in silico models have been developed for classifying LIHC patients in early and late stage using RNA expression and DNA methylation data. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset contains 173 early and 177 late stage samples of LIHC, was extensively analysed to identify differentially expressed RNA transcripts and methylated CpG sites that can discriminate early and late stages of LIHC samples with high precision. Naive Bayes model developed using 51 features that combine 21 CpG methylation sites and 30 RNA transcripts achieved maximum MCC 0.58 with accuracy 78.87% on validation dataset. Further, we also analysed genomics and epigenomics profiles of normal and LIHC samples and developed model to classify LIHC samples with AUROC 0.99. In addition, multiclass models developed for classifying samples in normal, early and late stage of cancer and achieved accuracy of 76.54% and AUROC of 0.86. Conclusion: Our study reveals stage prediction of LIHC samples with high accuracy based on genomics and epigenomics profiling is a challenging task in comparison to classification of LIHC and normal samples. Comprehensive analysis, differentially expressed RNA transcripts, methylated CpG sites in LIHC samples and prediction models are available from CancerLSP ( http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/ragahva/cancerlsp/ ).</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Kaur, H.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/31/292854</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1627d284e25:828029b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522518216229</crawled><fingerprint>a5bad6ce</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><description>Background: Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) is the second major cancer worldwide, responsible for millions of premature deaths every year. Prediction of clinical staging is vital to implement optimal therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction in cancer patients. However, to date, no method has been developed for predicting stage of LIHC from genomic profile of samples.

Metagenomics is a powerful tool for characterizing viral composition within environmental samples, but sample and molecular processing steps can bias the estimation of viral community structure. The objective of this study is to understand the inherent variability introduced when conducting viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater and provide a bioinformatic strategy to accurately analyze sequences for viral community analyses. A standard approach using a combination of ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, and DNase treatment, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) produced DNA preparations without any bacterial derived genes. Results showed recoveries in wastewater matrix ranged between 60–100%. A bias towards small single stranded DNA (ssDNA; polyomavirus) virus types vs larger double stranded DNA (dsDNA; adenovirus) viruses was also observed with a total estimated recovery of small circular viruses to be as much as 173-fold higher. Notably, ssDNA abundance decreased with sample dilution while large dsDNA genomes (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Caudovirales&lt;/i&gt;) initially increased in abundance with dilution before gradually decreasing with further dilution in wastewater samples. The present study revealed the inherent biases associated with different components of viral metagenomic methods applied to wastewater. Overall, these results provide a well-characterized approach for effectively conducting viral metagenomics analysis of wastewater and reveal that dilution can effectively mitigate MDA bias.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Nichole E.

In this study, we compared E. faecium strain 17OM39 with a marketed probiotic, non-pathogenic non-probiotic (NPNP) and pathogenic strains. The core genome analysis revealed, 17OM39 was closely related with marketed probiotic strain T110. Strain 17OM39 was found to be devoid of known vancomycin, tetracycline resistance genes and functional virulence genes. Moreover, 17OM39 is &apos;less open&apos; due to absence of frequently found transposable elements. Genes imparting beneficial functional properties were observed to be present in marketed probiotic T110 and 17OM39 strains.

Landscape connectivity is integral to the persistence of metapopulations of wide ranging carnivores and other terrestrial species. The objectives of this research were to investigate the landscape characteristics essential to use of areas by lynx and bobcats in northern New England, map a habitat availability model for each species, and explore connectivity across areas of the region likely to experience future development pressure. A Mahalanobis distance analysis was conducted on location data collected between 2005 and 2010 from 16 bobcats in western Vermont and 31 lynx in northern Maine to determine which variables were most consistent across all locations for each species using three scales based on average 1) local (15 minute) movement, 2) linear distance between daily locations, and 3) female home range size. The bobcat model providing the widest separation between used locations and random study area locations suggests that they cue into landscape features such as edge, availability of cover, and development density at different scales. The lynx model with the widest separation between random and used locations contained five variables including natural habitat, cover, and elevation—all at different scales. Shrub scrub habitat—where lynx’s preferred prey is most abundant—was represented at the daily distance moved scale. Cross validation indicated that outliers had little effect on models for either species. A habitat suitability value was calculated for each 30 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; pixel across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine for each species and used to map connectivity between conserved lands within selected areas across the region. Projections of future landscape change illustrated potential impacts of anthropogenic development on areas lynx and bobcat may use, and indicated where connectivity for bobcats and lynx may be lost. These projections provided a guide for conservation of landscape permeability for lynx, bobcat, and species relying on similar habitats in the region.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Laura E.

This paper presents a switching PD-based sliding mode control (PD-SMC) method for the 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) hovering motion of the underwater robot with tilting thrusters. Four thrusters of robot can be tilted simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical directions, and the 6-DOF motion is achieved by switching between two thruster configurations. Therefore, the tilting speed of thruster becomes the most essential parameter to determine the stability of hovering motion. Even though the previous PD control ensures stable hovering motion within a certain ranges of tilting speed, a PD-SMC is suggested in this paper by combining PD control with sliding mode control in order to achieve acceptable hovering performance even at the much lower tilting speeds. Also, the sign function in the sliding mode control is replaced by a sigmoid function to reduce undesired chattering. Simulations show that while PD control is effective only for tilting duration of 600 ms, the PD-based sliding mode control can guarantee the stable hovering motion of underwater robot even for the tilting duration of up to 1500 ms.

Four thrusters of robot can be tilted simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical directions, and the 6-DOF motion is achieved by switching between two thruster configurations. Therefore, the tilting speed of thruster becomes the most essential parameter to determine the stability of hovering motion. Even though the previous PD control ensures stable hovering motion within a certain ranges of tilting speed, a PD-SMC is suggested in this paper by combining PD control with sliding mode control in order to achieve acceptable hovering performance even at the much lower tilting speeds. Also, the sign function in the sliding mode control is replaced by a sigmoid function to reduce undesired chattering. Simulations show that while PD control is effective only for tilting duration of 600 ms, the PD-based sliding mode control can guarantee the stable hovering motion of underwater robot even for the tilting duration of up to 1500 ms. Extensive experimental results confirm the hovering performance of the proposed PD-SMC method is much superior to that of PD method for much larger tilting durations.</description><published>1521234000000</published><title>Switching PD-based sliding mode control for hovering of a tilting-thruster underwater robot</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282624v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282624v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282624v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Thousands of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) dynamically impact nearly all cellular functions.

Antimicrobial peptides represent an alternative to traditional antibiotics that may be less susceptible to bacterial resistance mechanisms by directly attacking the bacterial cell membrane. However, bacteria have a variety of defense mechanisms that can prevent cationic antimicrobial peptides from reaching the cell membrane. The L- and D-enantiomers of the antimicrobial peptide GL13K were tested against the Gram-positive bacteria &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus gordonii&lt;/i&gt; to understand the role of bacterial proteases and cell wall modifications in bacterial resistance. GL13K was derived from the human salivary protein BPIFA2. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by broth dilution and a serial assay used to determine bacterial resistance. Peptide degradation was determined in a bioassay utilizing a luminescent strain of &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; to detect peptide activity. Autolysis and D-alanylation-deficient strains of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gordonii&lt;/i&gt; were tested in autolysis assays and peptide activity assays. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; protease inactivated L-GL13K but not D-GL13K, whereas autolysis did not affect peptide activity. Indeed, the D-enantiomer appeared to kill the bacteria prior to initiation of autolysis. D-alanylation mutants were killed by L-GL13K whereas this modification did not affect killing by D-GL13K. The mutants regained resistance to L-GL13K whereas bacteria did not gain resistance to D-GL13K after repeated treatment with the peptides. D-alanylation affected the hydrophobicity of bacterial cells but hydrophobicity alone did not affect GL13K activity. D-GL13K evades two resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive bacteria without giving rise to substantial new resistance.

Interactions between DNA and proteins located in the cell nucleus play an important role in controlling physiological processes by specifying, augmenting and regulating context-specific transcription events. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a widely used methodology to study DNA-protein interactions and has been successfully used in various cell types for over three decades. More recently, by combining ChIP with genomic screening technologies and Next Generation Sequencing (e.g. ChIP-seq), it has become possible to profile DNA-protein interactions (including covalent histone modifications) across entire genomes. However, the applicability of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq has rarely been extended to non-model species because of a number of technical challenges. Here we report a method that can be used to identify genome wide covalent histone modifications in a group of non-model fruit fly species (Diptera: Tephritidae). The method was developed by testing and refining protocols that have been used in model organisms, including &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that this method is suitable for a group of economically important pest fruit fly species, viz., &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera dorsalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zeugodacus cucurbitae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera tryoni&lt;/i&gt;. We also report an example ChIP-seq dataset for &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tryoni&lt;/i&gt;, providing evidence for histone modifications in the genome of a tephritid fruit fly for the first time. Since tephritids are major agricultural pests globally, this methodology will be a valuable resource to study taxa-specific evolutionary questions and to assist with pest management. It also provides a basis for researchers working with other non-model species to undertake genome wide DNA-protein interaction studies.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Kumaran Nagalingam</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194420</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a61b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>fd9667ce</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kumaran Nagalingam, Michał T.

More recently, by combining ChIP with genomic screening technologies and Next Generation Sequencing (e.g. ChIP-seq), it has become possible to profile DNA-protein interactions (including covalent histone modifications) across entire genomes. However, the applicability of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq has rarely been extended to non-model species because of a number of technical challenges. Here we report a method that can be used to identify genome wide covalent histone modifications in a group of non-model fruit fly species (Diptera: Tephritidae). The method was developed by testing and refining protocols that have been used in model organisms, including &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that this method is suitable for a group of economically important pest fruit fly species, viz., &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera dorsalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zeugodacus cucurbitae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera tryoni&lt;/i&gt;. We also report an example ChIP-seq dataset for &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tryoni&lt;/i&gt;, providing evidence for histone modifications in the genome of a tephritid fruit fly for the first time. Since tephritids are major agricultural pests globally, this methodology will be a valuable resource to study taxa-specific evolutionary questions and to assist with pest management. It also provides a basis for researchers working with other non-model species to undertake genome wide DNA-protein interaction studies.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) method for non-model fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) and evidence of histone modifications</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4514</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4514</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/16zo8o2C90o/nm.4514</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targeting hepatic glutaminase activity to ameliorate hyperglycemia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting hepatic glutaminase activity to ameliorate hyperglycemia, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4514&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm.4514&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In mice, elevated glucagon during type 2 diabetes promotes more hepatic glutamine flux and greater gluconeogenesis, while reducing glutamine metabolism in the liver lowers hyperglycemia.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/16zo8o2C90o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>296</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nm.4514-F1.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Russell A Miller</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>37</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4514</link><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_16262ea192b:5b8e92a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522077931819</crawled><fingerprint>a2166db1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targeting hepatic glutaminase activity to ameliorate hyperglycemia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting hepatic glutaminase activity to ameliorate hyperglycemia, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4514&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm.4514&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In mice, elevated glucagon during type 2 diabetes promotes more hepatic glutamine flux and greater gluconeogenesis, while reducing glutamine metabolism in the liver lowers hyperglycemia.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/16zo8o2C90o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1522047600000</published><title>Targeting hepatic glutaminase activity to ameliorate hyperglycemia</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194820</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194820</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194820</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Trosan, Ingrida Smeringaiova, Kristyna Brejchova, Jan Bednar, Oldrich Benada, Olga Kofronova, Katerina Jirsova&lt;/p&gt;
The human amniotic membrane (HAM) is widely used for its wound healing effect in clinical practice, as a feeder for the cell cultivation, or a source of cells to be used in cell therapy. The aim of this study was to find effective and safe enzymatic HAM de-epithelialization method leading to harvesting of both denuded undamaged HAM and viable human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs). The efficiency of de-epithelialization using TrypLE Express, trypsin/ ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), and thermolysin was monitored by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by the measurement of DNA concentration. The cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. Scanning electron microscopy and immunodetection of collagen type IV and laminin α5 chain were used to check the basement membrane integrity. De-epithelialized hAECs were cultured and their stemness properties and proliferation potential was assessed after each passage. The HAM was successfully de-epithelialized using all three types of reagents, but morphological changes in basement membrane and stroma were observed after the thermolysin application. About 60% of cells remained viable using trypsin/EDTA, approximately 6% using TrypLE Express, and all cells were lethally damaged after thermolysin application. The hAECs isolated using trypsin/EDTA were successfully cultured up to the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; passage with increasing proliferation potential and decreased stem cell markers expression (&lt;i&gt;NANOG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOX2&lt;/i&gt;) in prolonged cell culture.

Outbreaks of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been reported in poultry species in the United States since 2014. These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2–4 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Hyesun Jang</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd074:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>260bbdf1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyesun Jang, Mohamed Elaish, Mahesh KC, Michael C.

mobility mass spectrometry to measure how three model proteins start to unfold.
Ubiquitin, cytochrome c and myoglobin ions produced via nESI from salty
solutions are subjected to UV irradiation pre-mobility separation, experiments
are conducted with a range of source conditions which alter the conformation of
the precursor ion as shown by the drift time profiles. For all three proteins
the compact structures result in less fragmentation than more extended
structures which emerge following progressive in-source activation. Cleavage
sites are found to differ between conformational ensembles, for example, for the dominant charge state of cytochrome c [M+7H]7+, cleavage at Phe10, Thr19
and Val20 was only observed in activating conditions while cleavage at Ala43 is
dramatically enhanced. Mapping the photo-cleaved fragments onto crystallographic
structures provides insight into the local structural changes that occur as
protein unfolding progresses, which is coupled to global restructuring observed
in the drift time profiles.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>In this work we couple UVPD with activated ion

Background &lt;p&gt;Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) can reduce under-5 morbidity and mortality in low-income settings. A program to strengthen IMCI practices through Mentorship and Enhanced Supervision at Health centers (MESH) was implemented in two rural districts in eastern Rwanda in 2010.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We estimated cost per improvement in quality of care as measured by the difference in correct diagnosis and correct treatment at baseline and 12 months of MESH. Costs of developing and implementing MESH were estimated in 2011 United States Dollars (USD) from the provider perspective using both top-down and bottom-up approaches, from programmatic financial records and site-level data. Improvement in quality of care attributed to MESH was measured through case management observations (n = 292 cases at baseline, 413 cases at 12 months), with outcomes from the intervention already published. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty under different assumptions of quality of care and patient volume.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The total annual cost of MESH was US$ 27,955.74 and the average cost added by MESH per IMCI patient was US$1.06. Salary and benefits accounted for the majority of total annual costs (US$22,400 /year). Improvements in quality of care after 12 months of MESH implementation cost US$2.95 per additional child correctly diagnosed and $5.30 per additional child correctly treated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incremental costs per additional child correctly diagnosed and child correctly treated suggest that MESH could be an affordable method for improving IMCI quality of care elsewhere in Rwanda and similar settings.

A widespread opinion is that conservation efforts disproportionately benefit charismatic species. However, this doesn’t mean that they are not threatened, and which species are “charismatic” remains unclear. Here, we identify the 10 most charismatic animals and show that they are at high risk of imminent extinction in the wild. We also find that the public ignores these animals’ predicament and we suggest it could be due to the observed biased perception of their abundance, based more on their profusion in our culture than on their natural populations. We hypothesize that this biased perception impairs conservation efforts because people are unaware that the animals they cherish face imminent extinction and do not perceive their urgent need for conservation. By freely using the image of rare and threatened species in their product marketing, many companies may participate in creating this biased perception, with unintended detrimental effects on conservation efforts, which should be compensated by channeling part of the associated profits to conservation. According to our hypothesis, this biased perception would be likely to last as long as the massive cultural and commercial presence of charismatic species is not accompanied by adequate information campaigns about the imminent threats they face.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Nro8ydzQjr8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003997</href></item></canonical><engagement>65</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003997</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2ae:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523555694285</crawled><fingerprint>d602cb88</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagementRate>6.5</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franck Courchamp, Ivan Jaric, Céline Albert, Yves Meinard, William J.

By freely using the image of rare and threatened species in their product marketing, many companies may participate in creating this biased perception, with unintended detrimental effects on conservation efforts, which should be compensated by channeling part of the associated profits to conservation. According to our hypothesis, this biased perception would be likely to last as long as the massive cultural and commercial presence of charismatic species is not accompanied by adequate information campaigns about the imminent threats they face.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Nro8ydzQjr8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1523555760964</recrawled><published>1523566800000</published><title>The paradoxical extinction of the most charismatic animals</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195659</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195659</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195659</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xuling Liu, Yang Yu, Shengmei Zhu&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to summarize and discuss the similarities and differences in inflammatory biomarkers in postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic retrieval of literature up to June 2017 in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and the Wanfang database was conducted. Extracted data were analyzed with STATA (version 14). The standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each indicator were calculated using a random effect model. We also performed tests of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, assessments of bias, and meta-regression in this meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 54 observational studies were included. By meta-analysis we found significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (9 studies, SMD 0.883, 95% CI 0.130 to 1.637, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 10 studies, SMD -0.133, 95% CI -0.512 to 0.246, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.429 in POCD) and interleukin (IL)-6 (7 studies, SMD 0.386, 95% CI 0.054 to 0.717, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 16 studies, SMD 0.089, 95% CI -0.133 to 0.311, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.433 in POCD) concentrations in both POD and POCD patients. We also found that the SMDs of CRP and IL-6 from POCD patients were positively correlated with surgery type in the meta-regression (CRP: Coefficient = 1.555365, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 10 studies; IL-6: Coefficient = -0.6455521, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.086, 16 studies).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Available evidence from medium-to-high quality observational studies suggests that POD and POCD are indeed correlated with the concentration of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers. Some of these markers, such as CRP and IL-6, play roles in both POD and POCD, while others are specific to either one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Xuling Liu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195659</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3ca:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><fingerprint>626b5664</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuling Liu, Yang Yu, Shengmei Zhu&lt;/p&gt;

The path choice behavior of battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers is influenced by the lack of public charging stations, limited battery capacity, range anxiety and long battery charging time. This paper investigates the congestion/flow pattern captured by stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) traffic assignment problem in transportation networks with BEVs, where the BEV paths are restricted by their battery capacities. The BEV energy consumption is assumed to be a linear function of path length and path travel time, which addresses both path distance limit problem and road congestion effect. A mathematical programming model is proposed for the path-based SUE traffic assignment where the path cost is the sum of the corresponding link costs and a path specific out-of-energy penalty. We then apply the convergent Lagrangian dual method to transform the original problem into a concave maximization problem and develop a customized gradient projection algorithm to solve it. A column generation procedure is incorporated to generate the path set. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and the solution algorithm.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Wentao Jing</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194354</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e18:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>de4e082b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wentao Jing, Mohsen Ramezani, Kun An, Inhi Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine clinical and ultrasonographic characteristics of male breast tumors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The medical records of male patients with breast lesions were retrieved from an electronic medical record database and a pathology database and retrospectively reviewed. A total of 112 men (125 breast masses) with preoperative breast ultrasonography (US) were included (median age, 59.50 years; age range, 15–96 years). Data extracted included patient age, if the lesions were bilateral, palpable, and tender, and the presence of nipple discharge. Breast lesion features on static US images were reviewed by three experienced radiologists without knowledge of physical examination or pathology results, original breast US image interpretations, or surgical outcomes. The US features were documented according to the BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) US lexicons. A forth radiologist compiled the data for analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 125 breast masses, palpable tender lumps and bilateral synchronous masses were more likely to be benign than malignant (both, 100% vs 0%, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Advanced age and bloody discharge from nipples were common in malignant lesions (P &amp;lt;0.05). A mass eccentric to a nipple, irregular shape, the presence of an echogenic halo, predominantly internal vascularity, and rich color flow signal on color Doppler ultrasound were significantly related to malignancy (all, P &amp;lt; 0.05). An echogenic halo and the presence of rich color flow signal were independent predictors of malignancy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Specific clinical and US characteristics of male breast tumors may help guide treatment, and determine if surgery or conservative treatment is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Wei-Hsin Yuan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194651</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37ba:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>b3999906</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei-Hsin Yuan, Anna Fen-Yau Li, Yi-Hong Chou, Hui-Chen Hsu, Ying-Yuan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Adapting community-based protected areas to local context and evaluating their success across a range of possible socio-economic and ecological outcomes depends, in part, on understanding the perceptions of local actors. This article presents results from a mixed methods study that focuses on how and why religious identity, a prominent aspect of Ghanaian culture, is related to perceptions of the performance of several Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs). CREMAs are a form of Ghanaian protected area that emphasizes community participation and a range of socio-economic and ecological objectives. Using importance-satisfaction analysis, large-scale survey results show that respondents that identify as Christians consistently assign greater importance to CREMA outcomes than do those that identify with Traditional religions. Education and whether respondents were native to an area (both of which were correlated with religious identity) were also systematically related to perceptions of CREMA importance, with those that are educated and non-native to an area tending to assign higher importance to CREMA outcomes. Follow up focus group participants from the Avu Lagoon CREMA suggest that the patterns result from differing ‘openness’ to new ideas, relative dependence on natural resources, acceptance of Traditional practices associated with conservation, and a sense, for some, that ecological conditions are divinely ordained. Christianity, education and non-nativity are associated with much larger performance gaps, particularly with respect to socio-economic impacts. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for conservation interventions and the use of perceptions in assessing protected area performance.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Grant Murray</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195498</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>9befc27c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Grant Murray, Andrew Agyare&lt;/p&gt;

We conclude that codon usage is a key factor affecting global relative mRNA and protein expression in trypanosomatids and that relative abundance can be effectively estimated using only protein coding sequences.</content></summary><title>Codon usage bias controls mRNA and protein abundance in trypanosomatids</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0004-z</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0004-z</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/9bZ9h83Y5LY/s41591-018-0004-z</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gain of toxic apolipoprotein E4 effects in human iPSC-derived neurons is ameliorated by a small-molecule structure corrector&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gain of toxic apolipoprotein E4 effects in human iPSC-derived neurons is ameliorated by a small-molecule structure corrector, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0004-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0004-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Human iPSC-derived neurons are generated from individuals with or without Alzheimer&apos;s disease carrying different APOE alleles and reveal a toxic, neuron-intrinsic gain of function of the ApoE4 variant that is a strong genetic risk factor for AD.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/9bZ9h83Y5LY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Chengzhong Wang</name></author><engagement>154</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0004-z</link><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_162aaf23cd3:15c25fa:923c4a60</id><crawled>1523286424787</crawled><fingerprint>b73d3171</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gain of toxic apolipoprotein E4 effects in human iPSC-derived neurons is ameliorated by a small-molecule structure corrector&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gain of toxic apolipoprotein E4 effects in human iPSC-derived neurons is ameliorated by a small-molecule structure corrector, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0004-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0004-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Human iPSC-derived neurons are generated from individuals with or without Alzheimer&apos;s disease carrying different APOE alleles and reveal a toxic, neuron-intrinsic gain of function of the ApoE4 variant that is a strong genetic risk factor for AD.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/9bZ9h83Y5LY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><engagementRate>1.15</engagementRate><published>1523257200000</published><title>Gain of toxic apolipoprotein E4 effects in human iPSC-derived neurons is ameliorated by a small-molecule structure corrector</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1422?rss=1</originId><published>1521740379000</published><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1422?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1422.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1422?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:415041b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><fingerprint>c2214b4e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>New Products</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00098</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00098</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00098</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522900800000</published><author><name>Justin M.

The sodium-independent cystine-glutamate antiporter plays an important role in extracellular cystine uptake. It comprises the transmembrane protein, xCT and its chaperone, CD98. Because glutathione is only weakly cell membrane permeable, cellular uptake of its precursor, cystine, is known to be a key step in glutathione synthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that xCT expression affects the progression of tumors and their resistance to therapy. Sulfasalazine is an inhibitor of xCT that is known to increase cellular oxidative stress, giving it anti-tumor potential. Here, we describe a radio-sensitizing effect of sulfasalazine using a B16F10 melanoma model. Sulfasalazine decreased glutathione concentrations and resistance to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in B16F10 melanoma cells, but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. It synergistically enhanced the cyto-killing effect of X-irradiation in B16F10 cells. It inhibited cellular DNA damage repair and prolonged cell cycle arrest after X-irradiation. Furthermore, in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; transplanted melanoma model, sulfasalazine decreased intratumoral glutathione content, leading to enhanced susceptibility to radiation therapy. These results suggest the possibility of using SAS to augment the treatment of radio-resistant cancers.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Masaki Nagane</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195151</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc713b:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>1aa12fc1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masaki Nagane, Eiichi Kanai, Yuki Shibata, Takuto Shimizu, Chie Yoshioka, Takuya Maruo, Tadashi Yamashita&lt;/p&gt;

L-carnitine is important for the catabolism of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria. We investigated how the triacylglycerol (TAG)-lowering drug 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) influenced lipid metabolism in carnitine-depleted, 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)propionate dehydrate (Mildronate; meldonium)-treated male Wistar rats. As indicated, carnitine biosynthesis was impaired by Mildronate. However, TAG levels of both plasma and liver were decreased by 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated animals. This was accompanied by increased gene expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial activity and proliferation and reduced mRNA levels of &lt;i&gt;Dgat2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ApoB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ApoCIII&lt;/i&gt; in liver. The hepatic energy state was reduced in the group of Mildronate and 1-triple TTA as reflected by increased AMP/ATP ratio, reduced energy charge and induced gene expression of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3. The increase in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was observed despite low plasma carnitine levels, and was linked to strongly induced gene expression of carnitine acetyltransferase, translocase and carnitine transporter, suggesting an efficient carnitine turnover. The present data suggest that the plasma TAG-lowering effect of 1-triple TTA in Mildronate-treated rats is not only due to increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation reflected by increased mitochondrial biogenesis, but also to changes in plasma clearance and reduced TAG biosynthesis.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Carine Lindquist</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194978</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424f:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>e96e7acc</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carine Lindquist, Bodil Bjørndal, Christine Renate Rossmann, Asbjørn Svardal, Seth Hallström, Rolf Kristian Berge&lt;/p&gt;

Rifapentine was found not to outperform rifampin, despite a lower minimum inhibitory concentration against &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in mouse models of TB. To understand these findings, we have developed a rabbit model of TB that reliably develops lung cavities with features similar to those of patients with pulmonary cavitary TB. After single or multiple doses of rifampin or rifapentine that produced human-equivalent plasma exposures, rabbits were sacrificed at different time points after dosing. We measured site-of-disease drug pharmacokinetics and tissue drug distribution. We used pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling to estimate drug penetration into different types of tubercular lesions. Both drugs penetrated rabbit lung cellular lesions, as well as the fibrotic cavity wall of cavitary lesions (penetration coefficients ≥1 compared to plasma). For the necrotic liquefied material inside cavitary lesions known as caseum (which contains high numbers of bacteria), the penetration coefficient was 1.0 for rifampin but only 0.25 for rifapentine. When estimates of site-of-disease drug PK were substituted into clinical PK/PD models, the relationship between site-of-action exposure and sputum culture conversion was significant (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt;).

Rifapentine was found not to outperform rifampin, despite a lower minimum inhibitory concentration against &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in mouse models of TB. To understand these findings, we have developed a rabbit model of TB that reliably develops lung cavities with features similar to those of patients with pulmonary cavitary TB. After single or multiple doses of rifampin or rifapentine that produced human-equivalent plasma exposures, rabbits were sacrificed at different time points after dosing. We measured site-of-disease drug pharmacokinetics and tissue drug distribution. We used pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling to estimate drug penetration into different types of tubercular lesions. Both drugs penetrated rabbit lung cellular lesions, as well as the fibrotic cavity wall of cavitary lesions (penetration coefficients ≥1 compared to plasma). For the necrotic liquefied material inside cavitary lesions known as caseum (which contains high numbers of bacteria), the penetration coefficient was 1.0 for rifampin but only 0.25 for rifapentine. When estimates of site-of-disease drug PK were substituted into clinical PK/PD models, the relationship between site-of-action exposure and sputum culture conversion was significant (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt;). We propose that poor penetration of rifapentine into lung cavitary lesions explains, in part, why rifapentine doses required to improve treatment outcomes in two phase 2 clinical trials were four times higher in TB patients with large cavities compared to TB patients without cavitary lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522864189000</published><title>[Research Articles] Pharmacokinetics of rifapentine and rifampin in a rabbit model of tuberculosis and correlation with clinical trial data</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195327</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195327</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195327</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew B.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (&lt;i&gt;Anas acuta&lt;/i&gt;), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Andrew B.

Air pollution causes severe physical and psychological health complications. Considering China’s continuously-deteriorating air quality, this study aimed to assess the self-reported effects of air pollution on the behavior and physical health of the students of 13 densely populated cities, and their awareness, practices, and perception of air pollution and its associated public health risks. A detailed, closed-ended questionnaire was administered to 2100 students from 54 universities and schools across China. The questionnaire, which had 24 questions, was categorized into four sections. The first two sections were focused on air pollution-associated behavior and psychology, and physical effects; while the final two sections focused on the subjects’ awareness and perceptions, and practices and concerns about air pollution. The respondents reported that long-term exposure to air pollution had significantly affected their psychology and behavior, as well as their physical health. The respondents were aware of the different adverse impacts of air pollution (respiratory infections, allergies, and cardiovascular problems), and hence had adopted different preventive measures, such as the use of respiratory masks and glasses or goggles, regularly drinking water, and consuming rich foods. It was concluded that air pollution and haze had negative physical and psychological effects on the respondents, which led to severe changes in behavior. Proper management, future planning, and implementing strict environmental laws are suggested before this problem worsens and becomes life-threatening.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Sohail Ahmed Rajper</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194364</canonicalUrl><engagement>4</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849e5:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>b9e2383d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sohail Ahmed Rajper, Sana Ullah, Zhongqiu Li&lt;/p&gt;

Autophagy plays a crucial role in health and disease, regulating central cellular processes such as adaptive stress responses, differentiation, tissue development, and homeostasis. However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti–hair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VVncDRle7Ww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002864</href></item></canonical><engagement>81</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002864</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1626db778eb:4248d4:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1522259163371</crawled><fingerprint>e04b4211</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Parodi, Jonathan A.

Molecular characterization of early hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains rare. Ten out of 78 patients of a hematology/oncology center were found to be HCV RNA positive two to four months after hospitalization. Only two of the ten patients were anti-HCV positive. HCV hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) was amplified in seven patients (including one anti-HCV positive) and analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS). Genetic variants were reconstructed by Shorah and an empirically established 0.5% variant frequency cut-off was implemented. These sequences were compared by phylogenetic and diversity analyses. Ten unrelated blood donors with newly acquired HCV infection detected at the time of donation (HCV RNA positive and anti-HCV negative) served as controls. One to seven HVR1 variants were found in each patient. Sequences intermixed phylogenetically with no evidence of clustering in individual patients. These sequences were more similar to each other (similarity 95.4% to 100.0%) than to those of controls (similarity 64.8% to 82.6%). An identical predominant variant was present in four patients, whereas other closely related variants dominated in the remaining three patients. In five patients the HCV population was limited to a single variant or one predominant variant and minor variants of less than 10% frequency. In conclusion, NGS analysis of a cluster of HCV infections acquired in the hospital setting revealed the presence of low diversity, very closely related variants in all patients, suggesting an early-stage infection with the same virus. NGS combined with phylogenetic analysis and classical epidemiological analysis could help in tracking of HCV outbreaks.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Kamila Caraballo Cortes</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194816</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b7:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>9f4e8b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kamila Caraballo Cortes, Magdalena Rosińska, Maciej Janiak, Małgorzata Stępień, Osvaldo Zagordi, Karol Perlejewski, Sylwia Osuch, Agnieszka Pawełczyk, Iwona Bukowska-Ośko, Rafał Płoski, Piotr Grabarczyk, Tomasz Laskus, Marek Radkowski&lt;/p&gt;

Activation of the amino acid starvation response (AAR) increases lifespan and acute stress resistance as well as regulates inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of AAR pharmacologically by Halofuginone (HF) significantly inhibits production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and provides protection from intestinal inflammation in mice. HF inhibits IL-1β through general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2)–dependent activation of the cytoprotective integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, resulting in rerouting of IL-1β mRNA from translationally active polysomes to inactive ribocluster complexes—such as stress granules (SGs)—via recruitment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) T cell–restricted intracellular antigen-1(TIA-1)/TIA-1–related (TIAR), which are further cleared through induction of autophagy. GCN2 ablation resulted in reduced autophagy and SG formation, which is inversely correlated with IL-1β production. Furthermore, HF diminishes inflammasome activation through suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which IL-1β is regulated by AAR and further suggests that administration of HF might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AhBKSDqeXkQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005317</href></item></canonical><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005317</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e8:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522950975641</crawled><fingerprint>d1fa6099</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Srikanth Battu, Sumbul Afroz, Jeevan Giddaluru, Saima Naz, Weishan Huang, Saratchandra Singh Khumukcham, Rafiq Ahmad Khan, SaleemYousuf Bhat, Insaf Ahmed Qureshi, Bramanandam Manavathi, Aleem Ahmed Khan, Avery August, Seyed Ehtesham Hasnain, Nooruddin Khan&lt;/p&gt;

Rhizobacteria associated with crops constitute an important source of potentially beneficial microorganisms with plant growth promoting activity or antagonistic effects against phytopathogens. In this study, we evaluated the plant growth promoting activity of 11 bacterial isolates that were obtained from the rhizosphere of healthy avocado trees and from that of avocado trees having survived root rot infestations. Seven bacterial isolates, belonging to the genera &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arthrobacter&lt;/i&gt;, promoted &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. These isolates were then tested for antagonistic activity against &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt;, in direct dual culture assays. Two of those rhizobacterial isolates, obtained from symptomatic-declining trees, displayed antagonistic activity. Isolate A8a, which is closely related to &lt;i&gt;Bacillus acidiceler&lt;/i&gt;, was also able to inhibit &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; growth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by 76% through the production of volatile compounds. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) allowed to tentatively identify the main volatiles emitted by isolate A8a as 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, 6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-one and 3-amino-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one. These volatile compounds have been reported to show antifungal activity when produced by other bacterial isolates. These results confirm the significance of rhizobacteria and suggest that these bacteria could be used for biocontrol of soil borne oomycetes through their volatiles emissions.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Alfonso Méndez-Bravo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194665</canonicalUrl><engagement>63</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37bc:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>b5a3221c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfonso Méndez-Bravo, Elvis Marian Cortazar-Murillo, Edgar Guevara-Avendaño, Oscar Ceballos-Luna, Benjamín Rodríguez-Haas, Ana L.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Children with chronic health conditions may perform poorer at school. Associations may be confounded by numerous social factors. We aimed to estimate the effects of a chronic health condition on overall school performance in first graders with an emphasis on rigorous adjustment for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A population-based cohort study was performed in the area of Mainz-Bingen (Germany). In 2015 all preschoolers were approached and the presence of a chronic health condition was assessed by parental questionnaires and preschool health examination data. The identification of a chronic health condition was based on special health care needs and presence of a doctor’s diagnosis out of 24 school-relevant diseases. At the end of the first school year, overall school performance was assessed by teachers and rated on a 5-item scale ranging from -10 to +10.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 3683 children approached, 2003 were enrolled. Overall school performance was available for 1462 children (51% boys). Of these, 52% suffered from a chronic health condition. Compared to children without a chronic health condition, children with special health care needs (15%) performed worse at school (adjusted mean difference: -0.95, 95% CI: [-1.55; -0.35], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). Children with a doctor’s diagnosis but without special health care needs (37%) did not perform worse at school.

Gene regulation at the transcriptional level is a central process in all organisms, and DNA-binding transcription factors, known as TFs, play a fundamental role. This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named “companion domain” (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: i) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA. Based on a classification of the organisms according to the life-styles, a major abundance of regulatory families in free-living organisms, in contrast with pathogenic, extremophilic or intracellular organisms, was identified. Finally, the protein architecture diversity associated to the 19 families considering a weight score for domain promiscuity evidenced which regulatory families were characterized by either a large diversity of CDs, here named as “promiscuous” families given the elevated number of variable domains found in those TFs, or a low diversity of CDs. Altogether this information helped us to understand the diversity and distribution of the 19 Prokaryotes TF families. Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Ernesto Perez-Rueda</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195332</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f68:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>993d9672</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto Perez-Rueda, Rafael Hernandez-Guerrero, Mario Alberto Martinez-Nuñez, Dagoberto Armenta-Medina, Israel Sanchez, J.

The prevalence of stunting among children below 5 years of age is higher in the slum-dwelling population of Bangladesh compared to that in both urban and rural areas. Studies have reported that several factors such as inadequate nutrition, low socio-economic status, poor hygiene and sanitation and lack of maternal education are the substantial predictors of childhood stunting. Almost all these factors are universally present in the slum-dwelling population of Bangladesh. However, few studies have prospectively examined such determinants of stunting among slum populations. In this paper, we reveal the findings of a cohort study with an aim to explore the status of micronutrient adequacy among such vulnerable children and establish its association with stunting along with other determinants. Two-hundred-sixty-five children were enrolled and followed since birth until 24 months of age. We collected anthropometric, morbidity and dietary intake data monthly. We used the 24-hour multiple-pass recall approach to collect dietary intake data from the age of 9 months onward. Micronutrient adequacy of the diet was determined by the mean adequacy ratio (MAR) which was constructed from the average intake of 9 vitamins and 4 minerals considered for the analysis. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models to establish the determinants of stunting between 12–24 months of age in our study population. The prevalence of low-birth-weight (LBW) was about 28.7% and approximately half of the children were stunted by the age of 24 months. The average micronutrient intake was considerably lower than the recommended dietary allowance and the MAR was only 0.48 at 24 months of age compared to the optimum value of 1. However, the MAR was not associated with stunting between 12–24 months of age. Rather, LBW was the significant determinant (AOR = 3.03, 95% CI: 1.69–5.44) after adjusting for other factors such as age (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.45–3.11 at 24 months and AOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.49–2.59 at 18 months, ref: 12 months) and sex (AOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.17–3.33, ref: female). Improving the nutritional quality of complementary food in terms of adequacy of micronutrients is imperative for optimum growth but may not be adequate to mitigate under-nutrition in this setting. Further research should focus on identifying multiple strategies that can work synergistically to diminish the burden of stunting in resource-poor settings.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Kazi Istiaque Sanin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195072</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef21:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>459b9215</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazi Istiaque Sanin, M.

P5B ATPases are present in the genomes of diverse unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, indicating that they have an ancient origin, and that they are important for cellular fitness. Inactivation of ATP13A2, one of the four human P5B ATPases, leads to early-onset Parkinson’s disease (Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome). The presence of an invariant PPALP motif within the putative substrate interaction pocket of transmembrane segment M4 suggests that all P5B ATPases might have similar transport specificity; however, the identity of the transport substrate(s) remains unknown. Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis possess three paralogous P5B ATPase genes, &lt;i&gt;catp-5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;catp-6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-7&lt;/i&gt;, which probably originated from a single ancestral gene around the time of origin of the Caenorhabditid clade. By using CRISPR/Cas9, we have systematically investigated the expression patterns, subcellular localization and biological functions of each of the P5B ATPases of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We find that each gene has a unique expression pattern, and that some tissues express more than one P5B. In some tissues where their expression patterns overlap, different P5Bs are targeted to different subcellular compartments (e.g., early endosomes vs. plasma membrane), whereas in other tissues they localize to the same compartment (plasma membrane). We observed lysosomal co-localization between CATP-6::GFP and LMP-1::RFP in transgenic animals; however, this was an artifact of the tagged LMP-1 protein, since anti-LMP-1 antibody staining of native protein revealed that LMP-1 and CATP-6::GFP occupy different compartments. The nematode P5Bs are at least partially redundant, since we observed synthetic sterility in &lt;i&gt;catp-5(0); catp-6(0)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-6(0) catp-7(0)&lt;/i&gt; double mutants. The double mutants exhibit defects in distal tip cell migration that resemble those of &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt; (alpha integrin ortholog) and &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; (Pax6 ortholog) mutants, suggesting that the nematode P5Bs are required for &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt;and/or &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; function. This is potentially a conserved regulatory interaction, since mammalian ATP13A2, alpha integrin and Pax6 are all required for proper dopaminergic neuron function.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Jeffrey Zielich</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194451</canonicalUrl><engagement>32</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849eb:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>689af77f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeffrey Zielich, Elena Tzima, Eva Ayla Schröder, Faten Jemel, Barbara Conradt, Eric J.

Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis possess three paralogous P5B ATPase genes, &lt;i&gt;catp-5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;catp-6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-7&lt;/i&gt;, which probably originated from a single ancestral gene around the time of origin of the Caenorhabditid clade. By using CRISPR/Cas9, we have systematically investigated the expression patterns, subcellular localization and biological functions of each of the P5B ATPases of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We find that each gene has a unique expression pattern, and that some tissues express more than one P5B. In some tissues where their expression patterns overlap, different P5Bs are targeted to different subcellular compartments (e.g., early endosomes vs. plasma membrane), whereas in other tissues they localize to the same compartment (plasma membrane). We observed lysosomal co-localization between CATP-6::GFP and LMP-1::RFP in transgenic animals; however, this was an artifact of the tagged LMP-1 protein, since anti-LMP-1 antibody staining of native protein revealed that LMP-1 and CATP-6::GFP occupy different compartments. The nematode P5Bs are at least partially redundant, since we observed synthetic sterility in &lt;i&gt;catp-5(0); catp-6(0)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-6(0) catp-7(0)&lt;/i&gt; double mutants. The double mutants exhibit defects in distal tip cell migration that resemble those of &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt; (alpha integrin ortholog) and &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; (Pax6 ortholog) mutants, suggesting that the nematode P5Bs are required for &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt;and/or &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; function. This is potentially a conserved regulatory interaction, since mammalian ATP13A2, alpha integrin and Pax6 are all required for proper dopaminergic neuron function.</description><published>1521234000000</published><title>Overlapping expression patterns and functions of three paralogous P5B ATPases in &amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1411?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1411?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1411?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Metal homeostasis poses a major challenge to microbes, which must acquire scarce elements for core metabolic processes.

To move a hard table together, humans may coordinate by following the dominant partner’s motion [1–4], but this strategy is unsuitable for a soft mattress where the perceived forces are small. How do partners readily coordinate in such differing interaction dynamics? To address this, we investigated how pairs tracked a target using flexion-extension of their wrists, which were coupled by a hard, medium or soft virtual elastic band. Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, who had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled partner’s muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one’s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information. This model elucidates the versatile mechanism by which humans can coordinate during both hard and soft physical interactions to ensure maximum performance with minimal effort.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bXD1PWYahz8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005971</href></item></canonical><engagement>52</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005971</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1624ed0b0a5:56eca:a077e55f</id><crawled>1521740722341</crawled><fingerprint>42fe5b05</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atsushi Takagi, Francesco Usai, Gowrishankar Ganesh, Vittorio Sanguineti, Etienne Burdet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; spp. constitute important traditional Chinese medicinal plants. Xinjiang is one of two diversity hotspots in China in which eight &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; species occur, two of which are endemic to the region. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships of Xinjiang &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; species (including &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;yuminensis&lt;/i&gt;) within the genus are unclear. In the present study, we sequenced the chloroplast (cp) genomes of seven &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; species in Xinjiang using the Illumina HiSeq platform, with the aim of assessing the global structural patterns of the seven cp genomes and identifying highly variable cp DNA sequences. These were compared to previously sequenced &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; cp genomes. Phylogenetic analysis was then used to evaluate the relationships of the Xinjiang species and assess the evolution of an undivided stigma. The seven cp genomes ranged from 151,764 to 152,112 bp, presenting a traditional quadripartite structure. The gene order and gene content of the seven cp genomes were identical. A comparison of the 13 cp genomes indicated that the structure is highly conserved. Ten highly divergent regions were identified that could be valuable in phylogenetic and population genetic studies. The phylogenetic relationships of the 13 &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; species inferred from the protein-coding genes, large single-copy, small single-copy, and inverted repeat regions were identical and highly resolved. The phylogenetic relationships of the species corresponded with their geographic distribution patterns, in that the north group (consisting of eight species from Xinjiang and Heilongjiang in North China) and the south group (including six species from South China) were basically divided at 40°N. Species with an undivided stigma were not monophyletic, suggesting that this trait might have evolved several times in the genus.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Yan Li</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194613</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a62d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>9d92683a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yan Li, Zhirong Zhang, Junbo Yang, Guanghui Lv&lt;/p&gt;

Metabolic profile of fresh turkey spermatozoa at three different reproductive period ages, namely 32, 44 and 56 weeks, was monitored by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and correlated to sperm quality parameters.

Metabolic profile of fresh turkey spermatozoa at three different reproductive period ages, namely 32, 44 and 56 weeks, was monitored by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and correlated to sperm quality parameters. The age-related decrease in sperm quality as indicated by reduction of sperm concentration, sperm mobility and osmotic tolerance was associated to variation in the level of specific water-soluble and liposoluble metabolites. In particular, the highest levels of isoleucine, phenylalanine, leucine, tyrosine and valine were found at 32 weeks of age, whereas aspartate, lactate, creatine, carnitine, acetylcarnitine levels increased during the ageing. Lipid composition also changed during the ageing: diunsaturated fatty acids level increased from 32 to 56 weeks of age, whereas a reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids content was observed at 56 weeks.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; exhibits intrinsic resistance to diverse groups of antibiotics in particular while growing in biofilms. Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, no comparative study to investigate the biofilm architectures of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and the related &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; under different nutrient concentrations has been reported. Therefore, this study aims to provide new information on the effects of four antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;. ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMI), meropenem (MEM) and doxycycline (DOX) on biofilm architecture of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; with different nutrient concentrations under static and flow conditions using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Impact of nutritional stress on drug susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; grown planktonically or as biofilm was also evaluated. The findings of this study indicate that nutrient-limited environment enhanced survival of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm after exposure to the tested antibiotics. The shedding planktonic &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; were also found to have increased CAZ tolerance in nutrient-limited environment. However, killing activities of MEM and IMI were stronger than CAZ and DOX on &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; both in planktonic cells and in 2-day old biofilm. In addition, MEM and IMI were able to inhibit &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; biofilm formation to a larger extend compared to CAZ and DOX. Differences in biofilm architecture were observed for biofilms grown under static and flow conditions. Under static conditions, biofilms grown in full strength modified Vogel and Bonner’s medium (MVBM) showed honeycomb-like architecture while a knitted-like structure was observed under limited nutrient condition (0.1×MVBM). Under flow conditions, biofilms grown in MVBM showed a multilayer structure while merely dispersed bacteria were found when grown in 0.1×MVBM. Altogether, this study provides more insight on the effect of four antibiotics against &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm under different nutrient and flow conditions. Since biofilm formation is believed to be involved in disease relapse, MEM and IMI may be better therapeutic options than CAZ for melioidosis treatment.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Chitchanok Anutrakunchai</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194946</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0ae4:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><fingerprint>da2818f0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chitchanok Anutrakunchai, Jan G.

The bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia was formally described two decades ago and originally believed to be a minor member of many ecosystems; however, it is now recognized as ubiquitous and abundant in both soil and aquatic systems. Nevertheless, knowledge of the drivers of its relative abundance and within-phylum habitat preferences remains sparse, especially in lake systems. Here, we documented the distribution of Verrucomicrobia in 12 inland lakes in Southeastern Michigan, a Laurentian Great Lake (Lake Michigan), and a freshwater estuary, which span a gradient in lake sizes, depths, residence times, and trophic states. A wide range of physical and geochemical parameters was covered by sampling seasonally from the surface and bottom of each lake, and by separating samples into particle-associated and free-living fractions. On average, Verrucomicrobia was the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most abundant phylum (range 1.7–41.7%). Fraction, season, station, and depth explained up to 70% of the variance in Verrucomicrobia community composition and preference for these habitats was phylogenetically conserved at the class-level. When relative abundance was linearly modeled against environmental data, Verrucomicrobia and non-Verrucomicrobia bacterial community composition correlated to similar quantitative environmental parameters, although there were lake system-dependent differences and &gt; 55% of the variance remained unexplained. A majority of the phylum exhibited preference for the particle-associated fraction and two classes (Opitutae and Verrucomicrobiae) were identified to be more abundant during the spring season. This study highlights the high relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in north temperate lake systems and expands insights into drivers of within-phylum habitat preferences of the Verrucomicrobia.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Edna Chiang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195112</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca425a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>a8448726</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edna Chiang, Marian L.

Spatial navigation and context-dependent episodic memories are represented in several interconnected regions including the hippocampal and entorhinal cortices, but the cellular mechanisms for their dynamic coupling remain to be defined. Using monosynaptically-restricted retrograde viral tracing in mice, we identified a subcortical GABAergic input from the medial septum that terminated in the entorhinal cortex, with collaterals innervating the dorsal presubiculum. Extracellularly recording and labeling GABAergic entorhinal-projecting neurons in awake behaving mice show that these subcortical neurons, named orchid cells, fire in long rhythmic bursts during immobility and locomotion. Orchid cells discharge near the peak of hippocampal and entorhinal theta oscillations, couple to entorhinal gamma oscillations, and target subpopulations of extra-hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. Thus, orchid cells are a specialized source of rhythmic subcortical GABAergic modulation of &apos;upstream&apos; and &apos;downstream&apos; cortico-cortical circuits involved in mnemonic functions.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Rhythmic theta frequency (~5-12 Hz) oscillations coordinate neuronal synchrony and higher frequency oscillations across the cortex.

Increasingly, ecoimmunology studies aim to use relevant pathogen exposure to examine the impacts of infection on physiological processes in wild animals. Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (“arboviruses”) responsible for millions of cases of human illnesses each year. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is a unique alphavirus that is transmitted by a cimicid insect, the swallow bug, and is amplified in two avian species: the house sparrow (&lt;i&gt;Passer domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) and the cliff swallow (&lt;i&gt;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota)&lt;/i&gt;. BCRV, like many alphaviruses, exhibits age-dependent susceptibility where the young are most susceptible to developing disease and exhibit a high mortality rate. However, alphavirus disease etiology in nestling birds is unknown. In this study, we infected nestling house sparrows with Buggy Creek virus and measured virological, pathological, growth, and digestive parameters following infection. Buggy Creek virus caused severe encephalitis in all infected nestlings, and the peak viral concentration in brain tissue was over 34 times greater than any other tissue. Growth, tissue development, and digestive function were all significantly impaired during BCRV infection. However, based on histopathological analysis performed, this impairment does not appear to be the result of direct tissue damage by the virus, but likely caused by encephalitis and neuronal invasion and impairment of the central nervous system. This is the first study to examine the course of alphavirus diseases in nestling birds and these results will improve our understanding of age-dependent infections of alphaviruses in vertebrate hosts.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Carol A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) impair the physical and mental status. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive ability of several cardiovascular biomarkers for identifying the incidence of disability as future recipients of public long-term care (LTC) service.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The subjects of this study were community-dwelling elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age without a history of CVD (n = 5,755; mean age, 71 years). The endpoint of this study was official certification as a recipient of LTC. The cohort was divided into quartiles (Qs) based on the levels of three CVD biomarkers: the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), plasma B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (BNP), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (hsCRP). A time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the multi-adjusted relative hazard ratios (HRs) for incident LTC among the quartiles of each biomarker.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the follow-up (mean 5.6 years), 710 subjects were authorized as recipients of LTC. The HR was only significantly increased in the higher Qs of UACR (Q3, p &amp;lt; 0.01; Q4, p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, other biomarkers were not significantly associated with the endpoint. The risk predictive performance for the incidence of LTC as evaluated by an essential model (i.e. age- and sex-adjusted) was significantly improved by incorporating the UACR (net reclassification improvement = 0.084, p &amp;lt; 0.01; integrated discrimination improvement = 0.0018, p &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that an increased UACR is useful for predicting physical and cognitive dysfunction in an elderly general population.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Shuko Takahashi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195013</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4253:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>e7c5a7d5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shuko Takahashi, Fumitaka Tanaka, Yuki Yonekura, Kozo Tanno, Masaki Ohsawa, Kiyomi Sakata, Makoto Koshiyama, Akira Okayama, Motoyuki Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; represents one of the major diarrhea-inducing pathogens threatening public health, but its prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profile in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, China, remains unclear. We conducted comprehensive investigation of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance pattern in Xinjiang, identifying 458 &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates between 2008 to 2014. &lt;i&gt;Shigella flexneri&lt;/i&gt; was identified as predominant species, and several &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were isolated, including atypical serotypes 1c, 2c, and 4s. Dominant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were 2a, 1b, 2b, and Xv, different from those generally dominant in China. A hybrid serotype pattern was observed, which included the major Chinese serotypes (2a, Xv) and those predominant in Pakistan (1b, 2b). &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; was shown to have a lower frequency compared with that generally observed in China, but an increasing trend of infections associated with this pathogen was observed. Furthermore, a high frequency of drug resistance and different &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; antimicrobial resistance patterns were demonstrated as well, including very severe resistance phenotypes, such as multidrug resistance and resistance to frontline antibiotics. Seventy-five cephalosporin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates were frequently identified with the resistance determinants that can undergo horizontal transfer, such as &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TEM&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt;, and integrons, facilitating the development of cephalosporin resistance among &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; subtypes. Additionally, genetic analyses demonstrated that all 86 quinolone-resistant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates possess 3–4 mutation sites in quinolone resistance-determining regions, primarily contributing to their resistance to quinolone. However, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sonnei&lt;/i&gt; isolates were not shown to be quinolone resistant. Co-resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was detected in 17 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates, and these isolates were additionally multidrug resistant and carried β-lactamase genes and quinolone-resistance determinants. As is demonstrated in this study, dominant serotypes of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; were distributed in unique trend with dangerous drug resistance patterns.

We conducted comprehensive investigation of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance pattern in Xinjiang, identifying 458 &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates between 2008 to 2014. &lt;i&gt;Shigella flexneri&lt;/i&gt; was identified as predominant species, and several &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were isolated, including atypical serotypes 1c, 2c, and 4s. Dominant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were 2a, 1b, 2b, and Xv, different from those generally dominant in China. A hybrid serotype pattern was observed, which included the major Chinese serotypes (2a, Xv) and those predominant in Pakistan (1b, 2b). &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; was shown to have a lower frequency compared with that generally observed in China, but an increasing trend of infections associated with this pathogen was observed. Furthermore, a high frequency of drug resistance and different &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; antimicrobial resistance patterns were demonstrated as well, including very severe resistance phenotypes, such as multidrug resistance and resistance to frontline antibiotics. Seventy-five cephalosporin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates were frequently identified with the resistance determinants that can undergo horizontal transfer, such as &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TEM&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt;, and integrons, facilitating the development of cephalosporin resistance among &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; subtypes. Additionally, genetic analyses demonstrated that all 86 quinolone-resistant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates possess 3–4 mutation sites in quinolone resistance-determining regions, primarily contributing to their resistance to quinolone. However, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sonnei&lt;/i&gt; isolates were not shown to be quinolone resistant. Co-resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was detected in 17 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates, and these isolates were additionally multidrug resistant and carried β-lactamase genes and quinolone-resistance determinants. As is demonstrated in this study, dominant serotypes of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; were distributed in unique trend with dangerous drug resistance patterns. Novel strategies are urgently required to prevent the development of drug resistance among diarrhea-inducing pathogens.</description><published>1522789200000</published><title>Dominant serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance profile of &amp;lt;i&gt;Shigella&amp;lt;/i&gt; spp. in Xinjiang, China</title></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Stability_of_Adsorbed_Water_on_TiO2-TiN_Interfaces_A_First_Principles_and_Ab_Initio_Thermodynamics_Investigation_/6022241</originId><published>1522022400000</published><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Stability_of_Adsorbed_Water_on_TiO2-TiN_Interfaces_A_First_Principles_and_Ab_Initio_Thermodynamics_Investigation_/6022241</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>8</engagement><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Stability_of_Adsorbed_Water_on_TiO2-TiN_Interfaces_A_First_Principles_and_Ab_Initio_Thermodynamics_Investigation_/6022241</link><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16262a9dfb1:5a33ca5:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522073722801</crawled><fingerprint>15511c74</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><description>Titanium Nitride (TiN)

molecular adsorption is more stable at higher coverages. The adsorption energy
is stronger at the oxygen defective interfaces which arises from the high

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Negatively biased interpretations play an important role in anxiety and depression, which are highly prevalent in adolescence, and changing such biases might thus reduce or prevent emotional disorders. We investigated the short- and long-term effects of an online interpretation bias modification training in unselected adolescents to explore its potential in preventing anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants (N = 173) were randomly allocated to eight online sessions of interpretation or placebo training. Interpretation bias was assessed pre- and post-training. Primary outcomes of anxiety and depression, and secondary measures of emotional resilience were assessed pre- and post-training and at three, six, and twelve months follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to placebo, interpretation training marginally increased positive interpretations. Irrespective of training condition, symptoms of anxiety and depression showed a decline post-training and at follow-up, and indices of resilience showed an increase. Change in interpretation bias, baseline interpretation bias, stressful life events, or number of training sessions completed did not moderate the effects on anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Results suggest that interpretation training as implemented in this study has no added value in reducing symptoms or enhancing resilience in unselected adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Leone de Voogd</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194274</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e12:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>4a5b76f2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leone de Voogd, Reinout W.

Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population genetics processes—notably, by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8BI0l7B3nAc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002985</href></item></canonical><engagement>6</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002985</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1623036aae5:5976dd:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521227311845</crawled><fingerprint>7ce5bfc3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuval B.

Our previous study indicated that orally administered LPSp was shown to exhibit an LDL-lowering effect in hyperlipidemic volunteers; however, a preventive effect of LPSp on atherosclerosis is unclear. The present study attempted to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic effect by LPSp in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis. For 16 weeks, apoE-deficient mice were fed an HFD and received drinking water containing LPSp (0.3 or 1 mg/kg body weight/day). The results showed that the orally administered LPSp decreased body weight. A significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque deposition was observed even with the lower dose of LPSp. The biochemical analyses showed that LPSp markedly improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma LDL and oxidized LDL levels. In addition, LPSp significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators including MCP-1 (in the plasma), TNF-α and IL-6 (in the colon), and decreased the oxidative burst activities in the peripheral blood sample. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that oral administration of LPSp can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative responses to prevent atherosclerosis and related metabolic disorders.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Yutaro Kobayashi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195008</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1f:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>9848fbe4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yutaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Inagawa, Chie Kohchi, Kimiko Kazumura, Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Toshiyuki Miwa, Katsuichiro Okazaki, Gen-Ichiro Soma&lt;/p&gt;

Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that oral administration of LPSp can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative responses to prevent atherosclerosis and related metabolic disorders.</description><published>1522184400000</published><title>Oral administration of &amp;lt;i&gt;Pantoea agglomerans&amp;lt;/i&gt;-derived lipopolysaccharide prevents development of atherosclerosis in high-fat diet-fed apoE-deficient mice via ameliorating hyperlipidemia, pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative responses</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24383-2</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24383-2</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/moPCM14e9aE/s41598-018-24383-2</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effects of noise on the internal resonance of a nonlinear oscillator&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects of noise on the internal resonance of a nonlinear oscillator, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24383-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24383-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Effects of noise on the internal resonance of a nonlinear oscillator&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/moPCM14e9aE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>450</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24383-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24383_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Damián H.

Natural reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;Yersinia (Y&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; comprise different animal species, but little is known about the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of yersiniosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218).

Tissue perfusion during surgery is important in reducing surgical site infections and promoting healing. This study aimed to determine if insufflation of the open abdomen with heated, humidified (HH) carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) increased visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature during open abdominal surgery in a rodent model. Using two different rodent models of open abdominal surgery, visceral perfusion and core temperature were measured. Visceral perfusion was investigated using a repeated measures crossover experiment with rodents receiving the same sequence of two alternating treatments: exposure to ambient air (no insufflation) and insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Core body temperature was measured using an independent experimental design with three treatment groups: ambient air, HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cold, dry (CD) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Visceral perfusion was measured by laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) and core body temperature was measured with a rectal thermometer. Insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a rodent open abdominal cavity significantly increased visceral tissue perfusion (2.4 perfusion units (PU)/min (95% CI 1.23–3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001) compared with ambient air, which significantly reduced visceral blood flow (-5.20 PU/min (95% CI -6.83- -3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001). Insufflation of HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the open abdominal cavity significantly increased core body temperature (+1.15 ± 0.14°C) compared with open cavities exposed to ambient air (-0.65 ± 0.52°C; p = 0.037), or cavities insufflated with CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (-0.73 ± 0.33°C; p = 0.006). Abdominal visceral temperatures also increased with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insufflation compared with ambient air or CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown by infrared thermography.

Tissue perfusion during surgery is important in reducing surgical site infections and promoting healing. This study aimed to determine if insufflation of the open abdomen with heated, humidified (HH) carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) increased visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature during open abdominal surgery in a rodent model. Using two different rodent models of open abdominal surgery, visceral perfusion and core temperature were measured. Visceral perfusion was investigated using a repeated measures crossover experiment with rodents receiving the same sequence of two alternating treatments: exposure to ambient air (no insufflation) and insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Core body temperature was measured using an independent experimental design with three treatment groups: ambient air, HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cold, dry (CD) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Visceral perfusion was measured by laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) and core body temperature was measured with a rectal thermometer. Insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a rodent open abdominal cavity significantly increased visceral tissue perfusion (2.4 perfusion units (PU)/min (95% CI 1.23–3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001) compared with ambient air, which significantly reduced visceral blood flow (-5.20 PU/min (95% CI -6.83- -3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001). Insufflation of HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the open abdominal cavity significantly increased core body temperature (+1.15 ± 0.14°C) compared with open cavities exposed to ambient air (-0.65 ± 0.52°C; p = 0.037), or cavities insufflated with CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (-0.73 ± 0.33°C; p = 0.006). Abdominal visceral temperatures also increased with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insufflation compared with ambient air or CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown by infrared thermography. This study reports for the first time the use of LASCA to measure visceral perfusion in open abdominal surgery and shows that insufflation of open abdominal cavities with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly increases visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature.</description><published>1522875600000</published><title>Increased visceral tissue perfusion with heated, humidified carbon dioxide insufflation during open abdominal surgery in a rodent model</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46963</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46963</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/HZ_fLBcdJOI/srep46963</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: Impairment of PDGF-induced chemotaxis by extracellular α-synuclein through selective inhibition of Rac1 activation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: Impairment of PDGF-induced chemotaxis by extracellular α-synuclein through selective inhibition of Rac1 activation, Published online: 06 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46963&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/srep46963&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: Impairment of PDGF-induced chemotaxis by extracellular α-synuclein through selective inhibition of Rac1 activation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/HZ_fLBcdJOI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Taro Okada</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46963</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1629a5229db:116837:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523007498715</crawled><fingerprint>2d656505</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: Impairment of PDGF-induced chemotaxis by extracellular α-synuclein through selective inhibition of Rac1 activation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: Impairment of PDGF-induced chemotaxis by extracellular α-synuclein through selective inhibition of Rac1 activation, Published online: 06 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46963&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/srep46963&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: Impairment of PDGF-induced chemotaxis by extracellular α-synuclein through selective inhibition of Rac1 activation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/HZ_fLBcdJOI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1522998000000</published><title>Erratum: Impairment of PDGF-induced chemotaxis by extracellular α-synuclein through selective inhibition of Rac1 activation</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005992</originId><author><name>Nika Abdollahi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/uLDwRntm3uo/article</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nika Abdollahi, Alexandre Albani, Eric Anthony, Agnes Baud, Mélissa Cardon, Robert Clerc, Dariusz Czernecki, Romain Conte, Laurent David, Agathe Delaune, Samia Djerroud, Pauline Fourgoux, Nadège Guiglielmoni, Jeanne Laurentie, Nathalie Lehmann, Camille Lochard, Rémi Montagne, Vasiliki Myrodia, Vaitea Opuu, Elise Parey, Lélia Polit, Sylvain Privé, Chloé Quignot, Maria Ruiz-Cuevas, Mariam Sissoko, Nicolas Sompairac, Audrey Vallerix, Violaine Verrecchia, Marc Delarue, Raphael Guérois, Yann Ponty, Sophie Sacquin-Mora, Alessandra Carbone, Christine Froidevaux, Stéphane Le Crom, Olivier Lespinet, Martin Weigt, Samer Abboud, Juliana Bernardes, Guillaume Bouvier, Chloé Dequeker, Arnaud Ferré, Patrick Fuchs, Gaëlle Lelandais, Pierre Poulain, Hugues Richard, Hugo Schweke, Elodie Laine, Anne Lopes&lt;/p&gt;
We present a new educational initiative called Meet-U that aims to train students for collaborative work in computational biology and to bridge the gap between education and research. Meet-U mimics the setup of collaborative research projects and takes advantage of the most popular tools for collaborative work and of cloud computing. Students are grouped in teams of 4–5 people and have to realize a project from A to Z that answers a challenging question in biology. Meet-U promotes &amp;quot;coopetition,&amp;quot; as the students collaborate within and across the teams and are also in competition with each other to develop the best final product. Meet-U fosters interactions between different actors of education and research through the organization of a meeting day, open to everyone, where the students present their work to a jury of researchers and jury members give research seminars. This very unique combination of education and research is strongly motivating for the students and provides a formidable opportunity for a scientific community to unite and increase its visibility. We report on our experience with Meet-U in two French universities with master’s students in bioinformatics and modeling, with protein–protein docking as the subject of the course. Meet-U is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly transferred to other fields and/or universities.

Background &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have established a correlation between coronary artery calcification (CAC) measured by ECG-gated chest computed tomography (CT) and cardiovascular disease. Recent reports which included asymptomatic patients suggest that CAC measured on non-ECG gated CT is similarly associated with cardiovascular risk. This study investigates the correlation between the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and an incidental finding of CAC on a non-gated chest CT performed for non-cardiac indications in young and seemingly healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study that included 162 CT scans performed in young patients aged 18–50 years old for non-cardiac indications in our institution was conducted. CAC score (CACS) was calculated using the Agatston method. FRS was calculated and compared to the CACS using three different approaches. The correlations between the CACS and several specific factors (i.e. age, body mass index, smoking, statins, etc.), were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of patients was 36.43 year old and 105 (64.8%) were male. We found a significant positive correlation between the CACS and the FRS in all three approaches (p&amp;lt;0.05). Increased age, smoking and statin use were the only individual factors clearly associated with an increase in CACS (p = 0.002, p = 0.045 and p = 0.009, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This is the first report indicating that incidental CACS identified in non-gated MDCT is also associated with cardiovascular risk evaluated by FRS in a young population. Our findings suggest that young asymptomatic individuals with incidental CAC should be seriously evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors despite presumption of belonging to a low cardiovascular risk category.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Gabriel Lichtenstein</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195061</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4257:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>95b0b8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Lichtenstein, Amichai Perlman, Shoshana Shpitzen, Ronen Durst, Dorit Shaham, Eran Leitersdorf, Auryan Szalat&lt;/p&gt;

It has been suggested that some cancer cells rely upon fatty acid oxidation (FAO) for energy. Here we show that when FAO was reduced approximately 90% by pharmacological inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) with low concentrations of etomoxir, the proliferation rate of various cancer cells was unaffected. Efforts to pharmacologically inhibit FAO more than 90% revealed that high concentrations of etomoxir (200 μM) have an off-target effect of inhibiting complex I of the electron transport chain. Surprisingly, however, when FAO was reduced further by genetic knockdown of &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt;, the proliferation rate of these same cells decreased nearly 2-fold and could not be restored by acetate or octanoic acid supplementation. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns had altered mitochondrial morphology and impaired mitochondrial coupling, whereas cells in which CPT1 had been approximately 90% inhibited by etomoxir did not. Lipidomic profiling of mitochondria isolated from &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns showed depleted concentrations of complex structural and signaling lipids. Additionally, expression of a catalytically dead &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;CPT1&lt;/i&gt; knockdowns did not restore mitochondrial coupling. Taken together, these results suggest that transport of at least some long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria by CPT1 may be required for anabolic processes that support healthy mitochondrial function and cancer cell proliferation independent of FAO.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xb9CFXhgCsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003782</href></item></canonical><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003782</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16272e5d344:b6d49:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522346087236</crawled><fingerprint>7606519</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cong-Hui Yao, Gao-Yuan Liu, Rencheng Wang, Sung Ho Moon, Richard W.

Taken together, these results suggest that transport of at least some long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria by CPT1 may be required for anabolic processes that support healthy mitochondrial function and cancer cell proliferation independent of FAO.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xb9CFXhgCsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522347665017</recrawled><published>1522357200000</published><title>Identifying off-target effects of etomoxir reveals that carnitine palmitoyltransferase I is essential for cancer cell proliferation independent of β-oxidation</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01196</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>213</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.7b01196/20180412/images/medium/ct-2017-01196t_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01196</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jctcce/~3/IXlFoer5_UE/acs.jctc.7b01196</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523505600000</published><author><name>Suhwan Song, Min-Cheol Kim, Eunji Sim, Anouar Benali, Olle Heinonen, Kieron Burke</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01196</link><id>nWAmhAfvfdY6zhQafSMhdWASYooG1IX3uplCe3rnLYA=_162bb957efc:904b:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523565559548</crawled><fingerprint>52f6bbf7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.7b01196/20180412/images/medium/ct-2017-01196t_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01196&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Many catabolic stimuli, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM), promote cartilage breakdown via the induction of collagen-degrading collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;MMP1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; in human articular chondrocytes. Indeed, joint diseases with an inflammatory component are characterised by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism. Importantly, protein kinase C (PKC) signalling has a primary role in cytokine-induced &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt; expression, and is known to regulate cellular functions associated with pathologies involving ECM remodelling. At present, substrates downstream of PKC remain undefined. Herein, we show that both IL-1- and OSM-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) in human chondrocytes is strongly associated with signalling via the atypical PKCι isoform. Consequently, inhibiting PKD activation with a pan-PKD inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Specific gene silencing of the PKD isoforms revealed that only PKD3 (&lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt;) depletion mirrored the observed &lt;i&gt;MMP&lt;/i&gt; repression, indicative of the pharmacological inhibitor specifically affecting only this isoform. &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing was also shown to reduce serine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as phosphorylation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinase groups. This altered signalling following &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing led to a significant reduction in the expression of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) genes &lt;i&gt;FOS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt;, critical for the induction of many MMPs including &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the AP-1 factor activating transcription factor 3 (&lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt;) was also reduced concomitant with the observed reduction in &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; expression.

Many catabolic stimuli, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM), promote cartilage breakdown via the induction of collagen-degrading collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;MMP1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; in human articular chondrocytes. Indeed, joint diseases with an inflammatory component are characterised by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism. Importantly, protein kinase C (PKC) signalling has a primary role in cytokine-induced &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt; expression, and is known to regulate cellular functions associated with pathologies involving ECM remodelling. At present, substrates downstream of PKC remain undefined. Herein, we show that both IL-1- and OSM-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) in human chondrocytes is strongly associated with signalling via the atypical PKCι isoform. Consequently, inhibiting PKD activation with a pan-PKD inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Specific gene silencing of the PKD isoforms revealed that only PKD3 (&lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt;) depletion mirrored the observed &lt;i&gt;MMP&lt;/i&gt; repression, indicative of the pharmacological inhibitor specifically affecting only this isoform. &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing was also shown to reduce serine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as phosphorylation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinase groups. This altered signalling following &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing led to a significant reduction in the expression of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) genes &lt;i&gt;FOS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt;, critical for the induction of many MMPs including &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the AP-1 factor activating transcription factor 3 (&lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt;) was also reduced concomitant with the observed reduction in &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; expression. Taken together, we highlight an important role for PKD3 in the pro-inflammatory signalling that promotes cartilage destruction.</description><published>1523653200000</published><title>Protein kinase D3 modulates MMP1 and MMP13 expression in human chondrocytes</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3794.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3794.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3794.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Multiple-scale mobility is ubiquitous in nature and has become instrumental for understanding and modeling animal foraging behavior.

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new more thermostable Flolan (epoprostenol) solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent in Japanese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) receiving higher doses of Flolan than those typically administered in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This open-label, single-arm study was conducted in 10 Japanese PAH patients. During the run-in period, patients were intravenously infused with Flolan (45 ng/kg/min or higher doses) solution prepared with the existing pH 10.5 diluent. The patients were then switched to a new more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent and observed for a 4-week treatment period. As a primary endpoint, safety after switching to the new Flolan solution was evaluated. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamics and the necessity for dose adjustment of Flolan in these patients.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All 10 patients completed the study period. Observed adverse events were nausea and hepatic function abnormal in 1 patient each, and both events were mild. No patients required dose adjustment due to the change from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) measured 3 hrs after switching to Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated diluent. No major changes from baseline in mPAP, pulmonary vascular resistance, or right atrial pressure were observed at 24 hrs and at 4 weeks after switching to the Flolan solution prepared with pH 12.0 diluent. Although some patients showed increases in cardiac output (CO) from baseline at 24 hrs and 4 weeks, no patients required dose reduction as a result of an increase in CO.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Neither safety/efficacy concerns nor any dose adjustments of Flolan after switching to a more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent could be required in Japanese patients with PAH receiving higher doses of Flolan.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02705807&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Kazuko Mihara</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195195</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>9ed8c6a9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazuko Mihara, Aiko Ogawa, Hiromi Matsubara, Takumi Terao, Yoshitaka Ichikawa&lt;/p&gt;

Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) has emerged as an important post-transcriptional mechanism that simultaneously alters expressions of thousands genes in cancers. However, only a few ceRNA genes have been studied for their functions to date. To understand the major biological functions of thousands ceRNA genes as a whole, we designed Model-based Analysis of Competing-endogenous Pathways (MACPath) to infer pathways co-regulated through ceRNA mechanism (cePathways). Our analysis on breast tumors suggested that NGF (nerve growth factor)-induced tumor cell proliferation might be associated with tumor-related growth factor pathways through ceRNA. MACPath also identified indirect cePathways, whose ceRNA relationship is mediated by mediating ceRNAs. Finally, MACPath identified mediating ceRNAs that connect the indirect cePathways based on efficient &lt;i&gt;integer linear programming&lt;/i&gt; technique. Mediating ceRNAs are unexpectedly enriched in tumor suppressor genes, whose down-regulation is suspected to disrupt indirect cePathways, such as between DNA replication and WNT signaling pathways. Altogether, MACPath is the first computational method to comprehensively understand functions of thousands ceRNA genes, both direct and indirect, at the pathway level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8vndNEzF5NY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006074</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006074</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1624ed0b0a5:56ecd:a077e55f</id><crawled>1521740722341</crawled><fingerprint>b6182e79</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyun Jung Park, Soyeon Kim, Wei Li&lt;/p&gt;

There is still no consensus on the true origin of fatal yellowing, one of the most important diseases affecting oil palm (&lt;i&gt;Elaeis guineensis&lt;/i&gt; Jacq.) plantations. This study involved two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MS&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;) analyses to identify changes in protein profiles of oil palms affected by FY disease. Oil palm roots were sampled from two growing areas. Differential accumulation of proteins was assessed by comparing plants with and without symptoms and between plants at different stages of FY development. Most of the proteins identified with differential accumulation were those related to stress response and energy metabolism. The latter proteins include the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, related to alcohol fermentation, which were identified in plants with and without symptoms. The presence of these enzymes suggests an anaerobic condition before or during FY. Transketolase, isoflavone reductase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and ferritin, among others, were identified as potential marker proteins and could be used to guide selection of FY-tolerant oil palm genotypes or to understand the source of this anomaly. When comparing different stages of FY, we observed high accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase and other abiotic stress related-proteins at all disease stages. On the other hand, biological stress-related proteins were more accumulated at later stages of the disease. These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Sidney Vasconcelos do Nascimento</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195538</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73e:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>71aec6f1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sidney Vasconcelos do Nascimento, Marcelo Murad Magalhães, Roberto Lisboa Cunha, Paulo Henrique de Oliveira Costa, Ronnie Cley de Oliveira Alves, Guilherme Corrêa de Oliveira, Rafael Borges da Silva Valadares&lt;/p&gt;

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b6:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><fingerprint>f0df1a15</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

The present paper proposed a finite element model of the high-temperature thermal contact resistance based on the multi-point contact model with the consideration of temperature-dependent material properties, heat radiation through the cavities at the interface and the effect of thermal interface material (TIM), and the geometry parameters of the finite element model are determined by simple surface roughness test and experimental data fitting. The experimental results of high-temperature thermal contact resistance between superalloy GH600 and C/C composite material are employed to validate the present finite element model.

DNA methylation is mediated by a conserved family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). The human genome encodes three active Dnmts (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b), the tRNA methyltransferase Dnmt2, and the regulatory protein Dnmt3L. Despite their high degree of conservation among different species, genes encoding Dnmts have been duplicated and/or lost in multiple lineages throughout evolution, indicating that the DNA methylation machinery has some potential to undergo evolutionary change. However, little is known about the extent to which this machinery, or the methylome, varies among vertebrates. Here, we study the molecular evolution of Dnmt1, the enzyme responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation patterns after replication, in 79 vertebrate species. Our analyses show that all studied species exhibit a single copy of the &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; gene, with the exception of tilapia and marsupials (tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil and opossum), each of which displays two apparently functional &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; duplicated before the radiation of major marsupial groups (i.e., at least ~75 million years ago), thus giving rise to two &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies in marsupials (copy 1 and copy 2). In the opossum lineage, copy 2 was lost, and copy 1 recently duplicated again, generating three &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies: two putatively functional genes (copy 1a and 1b) and one pseudogene (copy 1ψ). Both marsupial copies (&lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies 1 and 2) are under purifying selection, and copy 2 exhibits elevated rates of evolution and signatures of positive selection, suggesting a scenario of neofunctionalization. This gene duplication might have resulted in modifications in marsupial methylomes and their dynamics.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>David Alvarez-Ponce</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195162</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f45fe:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>22f41d4c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Alvarez-Ponce, María Torres-Sánchez, Felix Feyertag, Asmita Kulkarni, Taylen Nappi&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) digitization technique for natural objects, such as insects and plants. The key idea is to combine X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photographs to obtain both complicated 3D shapes and surface textures of target specimens. We measure a specimen by using an X-ray CT device and a digital camera to obtain a CT volumetric image (volume) and multiple photographs. We then reconstruct a 3D model by segmenting the CT volume and generate a texture by projecting the photographs onto the model. To achieve this reconstruction, we introduce a technique for estimating a camera position for each photograph. We also present techniques for merging multiple textures generated from multiple photographs and recovering missing texture areas caused by occlusion. We illustrate the feasibility of our 3D digitization technique by digitizing 3D textured models of insects and flowers. The combination of X-ray CT and a digital camera makes it possible to successfully digitize specimens with complicated 3D structures accurately and allows us to browse both surface colors and internal structures.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Takashi Ijiri</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195852</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d3:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>76ea1616</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ijiri, Hideki Todo, Akira Hirabayashi, Kenji Kohiyama, Yoshinori Dobashi&lt;/p&gt;

The use of antimicrobial monomers, linked to the polymer chain of resin composites, is an interesting approach to circumvent the effects of bacteria on the dental and material surfaces.

The development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies through mouse immunization often originates drug candidates that are not cross-reactive to the mouse ortholog. In such cases, and particularly in oncology, drug efficacy studies are performed on human tumor xenografts or with “surrogate” anti-mouse ortholog antibodies if targeting tumor host cells. Safety assessment of drug candidate(s) is performed at a later development stage in healthy non-human primates. While the latter remains necessary before a drug advances into human subjects, it precludes evaluation of safety in disease conditions and drug de-risking during early development. Therefore, mouse models that allow concomitant evaluation of drug efficacy and safety are highly desirable. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is an attractive target for tumor-targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics, with multiple mouse immunization-derived antibodies undergoing clinical trials. Given the pleiotropic role of CXCR4 in cancer biology, we anticipate continuous interest in this target, particularly in the testing of therapeutic combinations for immuno-oncology. Here, we describe the generation and validation of the first mouse knock-in of the whole coding region of human CXCR4. Homozygous human CXCR4 knock-in (hereafter designated as HuCXCR4KI) mice were viable and outwardly healthy, reproduced normally and nursed their young. The expression pattern of human CXCR4 in this model was similar to that of CXCR4 expression in normal human tissues. The human CXCR4 knock-in gene was expressed as a biologically active protein, thereby allowing normal animal development and adequate”homing” of leukocytes to the bone marrow. To further validate our model, we used an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; functional assay of leukocyte mobilization from bone marrow to peripheral blood by blocking CXCR4 signaling. Both an anti-human CXCR4 -specific blocking antibody and the small molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 induced increased leukocyte counts in peripheral blood, whereas an anti-mouse CXCR4 –specific blocking antibody had no effect. This new mouse model is useful to evaluate efficacy and safety of anti-human CXCR4 -specific drugs as single agents or in combination therapies, particularly in the oncology, immuno-oncology, wound healing and chronic inflammation therapeutic areas.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Maria José Costa</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194688</canonicalUrl><engagement>114</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f8907:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>1052c34b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria José Costa, Jyothirmayee Kudaravalli, Wen-Hui Liu, Jeffrey Stock, Sophanna Kong, Shu-Hui Liu&lt;/p&gt;

After carotid artery stenting, the procurement of information about blood flow redistribution among brain-feeding arteries and its time trend is essential to understanding a patient’s physiological background and to determine their care regimen. Cerebral blood flow has been measured twice following carotid artery stenting in few previous studies, with some discrepancies in the results. The purpose of this study was to measure cerebral blood flow at multiple time points after carotid artery stenting, and to elucidate the time trend of cerebral blood flow and redistribution among arteries. Blood flow rates in 11 subjects were measured preoperatively, at one day, one week, and about three months, respectively after carotid artery stenting by using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. The target vessels were the bilateral internal carotid arteries, the basilar artery, and the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. Lumen was semi-automatically defined using an algorithm utilizing pulsatility. The results showed that blood flow rates in the stented internal carotid artery and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery increased following carotid artery stenting. Blood flow rates in the contralateral internal carotid artery and the basilar artery gradually declined, and they were lower than the preoperative values at three months after stenting. The sum of blood flow rates of the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery increased after carotid artery stenting, and then decreased over the next three months. There was no significant change in the blood flow rate in the contralateral middle cerebral artery. From these results, it was concluded that redistribution among the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery occurs after carotid artery stenting, and that it takes months thereafter to reach another equilibrium.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Hisashi Tanaka</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195099</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd84:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>ba541727</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hisashi Tanaka, Yoshiyuki Watanabe, Hajime Nakamura, Hiroto Takahashi, Atsuko Arisawa, Takuya Fujiwara, Chisato Matsuo, Noriyuki Tomiyama&lt;/p&gt;

From these results, it was concluded that redistribution among the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery occurs after carotid artery stenting, and that it takes months thereafter to reach another equilibrium.</description><published>1523480400000</published><title>Multiple blood flow measurements before and after carotid artery stenting via phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging: An observational study</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03772-7</originId><published>1522220400000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03772-7</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03772-7</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Athlete brain bank, costly weather and science on social media&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athlete brain bank, costly weather and science on social media, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03772-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03772-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The week in science: 23–29 March 2018.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>7</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1626c8780ff:6a64c58:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522239242495</crawled><fingerprint>fe3b67d1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Athlete brain bank, costly weather and science on social media&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athlete brain bank, costly weather and science on social media, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03772-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03772-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The week in science: 23–29 March 2018.</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Athlete brain bank, costly weather and science on social media</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0192764</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0192764</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192764</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luis E.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess the association between perceived social support and induced abortion among young women in Lima, Peru. In addition, prevalence and incidence of induced abortion was estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study enrolling women aged 18–25 years from maternal health centers in Southern Lima, Peru, was conducted. Induced abortion was defined as the difference between the total number of pregnancies ended in abortion and the number of spontaneous abortions; whereas perceived social support was assessed using the DUKE-UNC scale. Prevalence and incidence of induced abortion (per 100 person-years risk) was estimated, and the association of interest was evaluated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. A total of 298 women were enrolled, mean age 21.7 (± 2.2) years. Low levels of social support were found in 43.6% (95%CI 38.0%–49.3%), and 17.4% (95%CI: 13.1%– 21.8%) women reported at least one induced abortion. The incidence of induced abortion was 2.37 (95%CI: 1.81–3.11) per 100 person-years risk. The multivariable model showed evidence of the association between low perceived social support and induced abortion (RR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.14–3.30) after controlling for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was evidence of an association between low perceived social support and induced abortion among women aged 18 to 25 years. Incidence of induced abortion was similar or even greater than rates of countries where abortion is legal. Strategies to increase social support and reduce induced abortion rates are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Luis E.

Background &lt;p&gt;The burden of medically-attended acute gastro-enteritis (MA-AGE) that can be attributed to norovirus is not well established in Japan. Using a nationwide database of medical care insurance claims, we estimated the incidence of medically-attended norovirus-attributable gastroenteritis (MA-NGE) in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The incidences of MA-NGE outpatient consultations or hospitalization in Japan were modelled on seasonal patterns of MA-AGE for unspecified causes derived from the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC) database for the period July 2007 to June 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age-adjusted annual incidence rates (per 10,000 person-years) of MA-NGE associated with outpatient care or hospitalization were 389 (95% CI 269–558) and 13 (95% CI 9–20), respectively. Highest rates were in children under 5 years of age: 1,569 (95% CI 1,325–1,792) for outpatient consultations and 48 (95% CI 39–56) for hospitalizations. Of all gastroenteritis episodes associated with outpatient care or hospitalization, 29% and 31% were attributed to norovirus, respectively. Norovirus was estimated to be responsible for 4,964,000 outpatient visits (95% CI 3,435,000–7,123,000) and 171,000 hospitalizations (95% CI 110,000–251,000) per year across Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Incidence rates of MA-AGE are high in Japan, and norovirus-attributable disease is at least as high as in some other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Chia-Hsien Chang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195164</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c54:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>898522fb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chia-Hsien Chang, Motonobu Sakaguchi, John Weil, Thomas Verstraeten&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt;, due to its short lipooligosaccharide structure, is generally more sensitive to the antimicrobial effects of some fatty acids than most other Gram negative bacteria. This supports recent development of a fatty acid-based potential treatment for gonococcal infections, particularly ophthalmia neonatorum. The &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; genome contains genes for fatty acid resistance. In this study, the potential for genomic mutations that could lead to resistance to this potential new treatment were investigated. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; strain NCCP11945 was repeatedly passaged on growth media containing a sub-lethal concentration of fatty acid myristic acid and monoglyceride monocaprin.

Of note, monocaprin grown cultures developed a mutation in transcription factor gene &lt;i&gt;dksA&lt;/i&gt;, which suppresses molecular chaperone DnaK and may be involved in the stress response. The minimum inhibitory concentration after exposure to monocaprin showed a modest two-fold change. The results of this study suggest that &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; cannot readily evolve resistance that will impact treatment of ophthalmia neonatorum with monocaprin.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Colin P.

Genetic diversity and structure of populations at the edge of the species’ spatial distribution are important for potential adaptation to environmental changes and consequently, for the long-term survival of the species. Here, we combined classical population genetic methods with newly developed network analyses to gain complementary insights into the genetic structure and diversity of &lt;i&gt;Acacia tortilis&lt;/i&gt;, a keystone desert tree, at the northern edge of its global distribution, where the population is under threat from climatic, ecological, and anthropogenic changes. We sampled &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tortilis&lt;/i&gt; from 14 sites along the Dead Sea region and the Arava Valley in Israel and in Jordan. In addition, we obtained samples from Egypt and Sudan, the hypothesized origin of the species. Samples from all sites were genotyped using six polymorphic microsatellite loci.Our results indicate a significant genetic structure in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tortilis&lt;/i&gt; along the Arava Valley. This was detected at different hierarchical levels—from the basic unit of the subpopulation, corresponding to groups of trees within ephemeral rivers (wadis), to groups of subpopulations (&lt;i&gt;communities&lt;/i&gt;) that are genetically more connected relative to others. The latter structure mostly corresponds to the partition of the major drainage basins in the area. Network analyses, combined with classical methods, allowed for the identification of key &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tortilis&lt;/i&gt; subpopulations in this region, characterized by their relatively high level of genetic diversity and centrality in maintaining gene flow in the population. Characterizing such key subpopulations may enable conservation managers to focus their efforts on certain subpopulations that might be particularly important for the population’s long-term persistence, thus contributing to species conservation within its peripheral range.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Yael S.

Ascorbic acid (AsA), chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and their associated gene expression patterns were analysed in &lt;i&gt;Actinidia chinensis&lt;/i&gt; ‘Hongyang’ outer pericarp. The results showed chlorophyll degradation during fruit development and softening, exposed the yellow carotenoid pigments. &lt;i&gt;LHCB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CLS1&lt;/i&gt; gene expressions were decreased, while &lt;i&gt;PPH2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPH3&lt;/i&gt; gene expressions were increased, indicating that downregulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis and upregulation of its degradation, caused chlorophyll degradation.

A decrease in the expression of the late carotenoid biosynthesis and maintenance genes (&lt;i&gt;LCYB1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;LCYE1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CYP1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CYP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ZEP1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;VDE1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;VDE2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;NCED2&lt;/i&gt;) and degradation gene (&lt;i&gt;CCD1&lt;/i&gt;), showed biosynthesis and degradation of carotenoid could be regulatory factors involved in fruit development. Most genes expression data of L-galactose and recycling pathway were agreement with the AsA concentrations in the fruit, suggesting these are the predominant pathways of AsA biosynthesis. &lt;i&gt;GMP1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GME1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GGP1&lt;/i&gt; were identified as the key genes controlling AsA biosynthesis in ‘Hongyang’ outer pericarp.</description><published>1522098000000</published><title>Chlorophyll, carotenoid and vitamin C metabolism regulation in &amp;lt;i&gt;Actinidia chinensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; &apos;Hongyang&apos; outer pericarp during fruit development</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010177?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010177?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010177?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/10&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 10&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1521003397000</published><author><name>Zelig Chernia</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1622b92a890:dafc9a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521149454480</crawled><fingerprint>4d921b34</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Complexation reactions in pyridine and 2,6-dimethylpyridine-water system: The quantum-chemical description and the path to liquid phase separation</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293944v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293944v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293944v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Current genotyping approaches for single nucleotide variations (SNVs) rely on short, relatively accurate reads from second generation sequencing devices.

A chemical and microbiological characterization on &lt;i&gt;Hermetia illucens&lt;/i&gt; larvae was carried out as well as an inactivation study of natural contaminating microorganisms and inoculated &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 in black soldier larvae by using High Hydrostatic Pressure (250 to 400 MPa, for 1.5 to 15 min). &lt;i&gt;Hermetia illucens&lt;/i&gt; was mainly composed of proteins (46.49%, d.m.) followed by fat (37.88%, d.m.). Larvae had a high contamination load of Total Aerobic Mesophilic bacteria (AMB) (1.58x10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/g) and Enterobacteriaceae (1.15x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;cfu/g). The presence of pathogenic microorganism varied: no &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; spp. were found, but &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; (1.15x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/g) and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (7.08x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/g) were detected in the larvae extract. High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) was effective against natural contaminating yeasts and molds producing more than 5 log cycle reductions at 400 MPa for any of the times considered (2.5 to 7 min), but a low reduction of total microbial load was achieved. The inactivation level of larvae inoculated with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 varied. At 400 MPa for 7 min more than 5 log cycle reductions were achieved.

Statin users were defined as participants who were prescribed statins more than twice during 6 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 17,798 statin non-users and 22,366 statin users. During 7.66±3.21 years of follow-up, incident DM developed in 5.68% of statin non-users and 7.64% of statin users. Among the entire study population, statin use was associated with new-onset DM after adjusting for clinical risk factors. In sub-analysis according to hypertension, statin use significantly increased the risk of incident DM only in normotensive patients [hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.58, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004], and not in hypertensive patients (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05). Furthermore, continuous statin use was strongly associated with new-onset DM in women, regardless of hypertension presence (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05).

Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against complement protein C5, is considered to be the current standard of care for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. This study describes the generation and preclinical attributes of ALXN1210, a new long-acting anti-C5 mAb, obtained through select modifications to eculizumab to both largely abolish target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and increase recycling efficiency via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). To attenuate the effect of TMDD on plasma terminal half-life (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;), histidine substitutions were engineered into the complementarity-determining regions of eculizumab to enhance the dissociation rate of the mAb:C5 complex in the acidic early endosome relative to the slightly basic pH of blood. Antibody variants with optimal pH-dependent binding to C5 exhibited little to no TMDD in mice in the presence of human C5. To further enhance the efficiency of FcRn-mediated recycling of the antibody, two additional substitutions were introduced to increase affinity for human FcRn. These substitutions yielded an additional doubling of the t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; of surrogate anti-mouse C5 antibodies with reduced TMDD in transgenic mice expressing the human FcRn. In conclusion, ALXN1210 is a promising new therapeutic candidate currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Douglas Sheridan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66da:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>715cda6d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Douglas Sheridan, Zhao-Xue Yu, Yuchun Zhang, Rekha Patel, Fang Sun, Melissa A.

These features lead to broad applications but also create challenges for their construction. We report the engineering of hemeproteins that catalyze the formation of chiral bicyclobutanes, one of the most strained four-membered systems, via successive carbene addition to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds. Enzymes that produce cyclopropenes, putative intermediates to the bicyclobutanes, were also identified. These genetically encoded proteins are readily optimized by directed evolution, function in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and act on structurally diverse substrates with high efficiency and selectivity, providing an effective route to many chiral strained structures.

These features lead to broad applications but also create challenges for their construction. We report the engineering of hemeproteins that catalyze the formation of chiral bicyclobutanes, one of the most strained four-membered systems, via successive carbene addition to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds. Enzymes that produce cyclopropenes, putative intermediates to the bicyclobutanes, were also identified. These genetically encoded proteins are readily optimized by directed evolution, function in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and act on structurally diverse substrates with high efficiency and selectivity, providing an effective route to many chiral strained structures.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Strength training improves distance running economy and performance. This finding is based predominantly on maximal and explosive strength programmes applied to locomotor muscles, particularly on the lower limbs. It is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic cost (C&lt;sub&gt;met&lt;/sub&gt;) and an improvement in running performance is feasible with strength training of the postural and trunk muscles.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using kinematic, neuromuscular and metabolic measurements of running at two different speeds before and after a 12-week Pilates training programme, we tested the hypothesis that core training might improve the running C&lt;sub&gt;met&lt;/sub&gt; and performance of trained runners. Thirty-two individuals were randomly assigned to the control group (CG, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) or the Pilates group (PG, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Confirming our hypothesis, a significant improvement (p&amp;lt;0.05) was observed for running performance in the PG (pre: 25.65±0.4 min; post: 23.23±0.4 min) compared to the CG (pre: 25.33±0.58 min; post: 24.61±0.52 min).

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether preoperative breast dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging kinetic features, assessed using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), can predict survival outcome and tumor aggressiveness in patients with invasive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Between March and December 2011, 301 women who underwent preoperative DCE MR imaging for invasive breast cancer, with CAD data, were identified. All MR images were retrospectively evaluated using a commercially available CAD system. The following kinetic parameters were prospectively recorded for each lesion: initial peak enhancement, the proportion of early phase medium and rapid enhancement, and the proportion of delayed phase persistent, plateau, and washout enhancement. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association between the kinetic features assessed by CAD and disease-free survival (DFS). The peak signal intensity and kinetic enhancement profiles were compared with the clinical-pathological variables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 32 recurrences during a mean follow-up time of 55.2 months (range, 5–72 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher peak enhancement (DFS hazard ratio, 1.004 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.001, 1.006]; &lt;i&gt;P =&lt;/i&gt; .013) on DCE MR imaging and a triple-negative subtype (DFS hazard ratio, 21.060 [95% CI: 2.675, 165.780]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .004) were associated with a poorer DFS. Higher peak enhancement was significantly associated with a higher tumor stage, clinical stage, and histologic grade.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with breast cancer who showed higher CAD-derived peak enhancement on breast MR imaging had worse DFS.

Koalas (&lt;i&gt;Phascolarctos cinereus&lt;/i&gt;) are iconic Australian marsupials currently threatened by several processes, including infectious diseases and ecological disruption. Infection with &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, is considered a key driver of population decline. The clinical sign of ‘wet bottom’, a staining of the rump associated with urinary incontinence, is often caused by chlamydial urinary tract infections. However, wet bottom has been recorded in koalas free of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting other causative agents in those individuals. We used 16S rRNA diversity profiling to investigate the microbiome of the urogenital tract of ten female koalas in order to identify potential causative agents of wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;. Five urogenital samples were processed from koalas presenting with wet bottom and five were clinically normal. All koalas were negative for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. We detected thirteen phyla across the ten samples, with &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; occurring at the highest relative abundance (77.6%). The order &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillales&lt;/i&gt;, within the &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, comprised 70.3% of the reads from all samples. After normalising reads using DESeq2 and testing for significant differences (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), there were 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) more commonly found in one group over the other. The families &lt;i&gt;Aerococcaceae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; both had four significantly differentially abundant OTUs. These four &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; OTUs were all significantly more abundant in koalas with wet bottom. This study provides the foundation for future investigations of causes of koala wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. This is of clinical relevance as wet bottom is often assumed to be caused by &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; and treated accordingly. Our research highlights that other organisms may be causing wet bottom, and these potential aetiological agents need to be further investigated to fully address the problems this species faces.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Alistair R.

We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErL2lgBM7O0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006092</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006092</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162ab8d3c72:d9a78:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523296582770</crawled><fingerprint>37c4f22b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurent Dollé, Ricardo Chavarriaga, Agnès Guillot, Mehdi Khamassi&lt;/p&gt;

Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErL2lgBM7O0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1523306525319</recrawled><published>1523307600000</published><title>Interactions of spatial strategies producing generalization gradient and blocking: A computational approach</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/24?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/24?rss=1</link><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522950073000</published><author><name>Kumar, S.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/24.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>8</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a52985a:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/24?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>113c955d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Asia/Pacific News, Paleontology, Scientific Community</item></keywords><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>A one-man fossil rescue mission</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10886</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>239</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b10886/20180320/images/medium/jp-2017-10886w_0006.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10886</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/z-gObeQkeDg/acs.jpcb.7b10886</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521518400000</published><author><name>Sen Mou, Andrea Rubano, Domenico Paparo</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10886</link><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_16244bbf7a7:1b67f5:a077e55f</id><crawled>1521571592103</crawled><fingerprint>14dbc347</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b10886/20180320/images/medium/jp-2017-10886w_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10886&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Together, these data suggest that TLR3 promotes the clearance of &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; during early and mid-stages of genital tract infection, and that loss of TLR3 is detrimental in the development hydrosalpinx.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Sebastian E.

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be overcome by electrical stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) via a cochlear implant (CI). Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between the SGNs and the electrode, but the efficacy of CI is also limited by the degeneration of SGNs as one consequence of SHNL. In the healthy cochlea, the survival of SGNs is assured by endogenous neurotrophic support. Several applications of exogenous neurotrophic supply have been shown to reduce SGN degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the present study, nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs), with an approximate diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, were loaded with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to test their efficacy as long-term delivery system for neurotrophins. The neurotrophic factor was released constantly from the NPSNPs over a release period of 80 days when the surface of the nanoparticles had been modified with amino groups. Cell culture investigations with NIH3T3 fibroblasts attest a good general cytocompatibility of the NPSNPs. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments with SGNs indicate a significantly higher survival rate of SGNs in cell cultures that contained BDNF-loaded nanoparticles compared to the control culture with unloaded NPSNPs (p&amp;lt;0.001). Importantly, also the amounts of BDNF released up to a time period of 39 days increased the survival rate of SGNs. Thus, NPSNPs carrying BDNF are suitable for the treatment of inner ear disease and for the protection and the support of SGNs. Their nanoscale nature and the fact that a direct contact of the nanoparticles and the SGNs is not necessary for neuroprotective effects, should allow for the facile preparation of nanocomposites, e.g., with biocompatible polymers, to install coatings on implants for the realization of implant-based growth factor delivery systems.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Nadeschda Schmidt</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194778</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f0a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>8ab24b99</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadeschda Schmidt, Jennifer Schulze, Dawid P.

Their nanoscale nature and the fact that a direct contact of the nanoparticles and the SGNs is not necessary for neuroprotective effects, should allow for the facile preparation of nanocomposites, e.g., with biocompatible polymers, to install coatings on implants for the realization of implant-based growth factor delivery systems.</description><published>1522184400000</published><title>Long-term delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from nanoporous silica nanoparticles improves the survival of spiral ganglion neurons in vitro</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6</originId><published>1522825200000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Female leadership falls at top universities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female leadership falls at top universities, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03927-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Decline in number of female presidents since last year underscores concerns about lack of female role models and advocacy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>8</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1628fb05173:99aab6e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522829119859</crawled><fingerprint>7f541cac</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Female leadership falls at top universities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female leadership falls at top universities, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03927-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Decline in number of female presidents since last year underscores concerns about lack of female role models and advocacy.</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Female leadership falls at top universities</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00201</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>344</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00201/20180410/images/medium/bi-2018-00201z_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00201</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/iwVPPh4NSF0/acs.biochem.8b00201</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523332800000</published><author><name>Vern L.

&lt;i&gt;Lolium perenne&lt;/i&gt; L. (perennial ryegrass) is the most important pasture grass species in temperate regions of the world. However, its growth is restricted in summer dry environments. Germplasm screening can be used to identify accessions or individual plants for incorporation into breeding programs for drought tolerance. We selected nine perennial ryegrass accessions from different global origins and from a range of climatic and environmental conditions. In addition, the perennial ryegrass cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’ was chosen as a reference. The accessions were grown for 360 days in a controlled environment through six consecutive drought stress and recovery cycles. We observed intraspecific differences in drought stress responsiveness for shoot biomass and survival from the third stress cycle. An accession from Norway had 50% more shoot dry matter than the next best-performing accession after six drought cycles. Compared with the reference cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’, shoot dry matter of the accession from Norway was more than seven times higher after six drought cycles, indicating superior performance of this ecotype under drought stress. Drought tolerance was characterized by osmotic adjustment and higher relative leaf water content at low soil moisture levels. Furthermore, the findings of this study identify solute potential as an early predictor of drought stress tolerance. These intraspecific differences can be used in breeding programs for the development of drought-tolerant perennial ryegrass cultivars.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Daliya Cyriac</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194977</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575ea:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>ffb78184</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daliya Cyriac, Rainer W.

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury still represents a major concern in clinical transplantation, especially in the era of extreme organ shortage and extended criteria donor organs. In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240–340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;RIC 1 group showed significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Zoltan Czigany</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec7:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><fingerprint>968614f6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zoltan Czigany, Christian Bleilevens, Christian Beckers, Christian Stoppe, Michaela Möhring, Andras Fülöp, Attila Szijarto, Georg Lurje, Ulf P.

In the event of an incident involving the release of a hazardous chemical, first responders may decide to initiate emergency decontamination in order to remove any contaminant from affected casualties. Recent initiatives such as the UK Home Office-led Initial Operational Response Programme have introduced new evidence-based decontamination protocols that reduce the time taken to initiate the decontamination process, including an increased emphasis on rapidly removing contaminated clothing (disrobe), and the use of improvised dry decontamination methods. The current study used a series of focus groups to examine public perceptions of different decontamination interventions and responder management strategies. Results revealed that a decontamination shower was perceived to be more effective than dry decontamination methods and that a management strategy that included effective responder communication resulted in increased willingness to comply with the need for decontamination. This study demonstrates that public understanding and acceptance of novel decontamination methods such as dry decontamination may present additional challenges for first responders. Increased emphasis on effective communication during decontamination is needed.

In the event of an incident involving the release of a hazardous chemical, first responders may decide to initiate emergency decontamination in order to remove any contaminant from affected casualties. Recent initiatives such as the UK Home Office-led Initial Operational Response Programme have introduced new evidence-based decontamination protocols that reduce the time taken to initiate the decontamination process, including an increased emphasis on rapidly removing contaminated clothing (disrobe), and the use of improvised dry decontamination methods. The current study used a series of focus groups to examine public perceptions of different decontamination interventions and responder management strategies. Results revealed that a decontamination shower was perceived to be more effective than dry decontamination methods and that a management strategy that included effective responder communication resulted in increased willingness to comply with the need for decontamination. This study demonstrates that public understanding and acceptance of novel decontamination methods such as dry decontamination may present additional challenges for first responders. Increased emphasis on effective communication during decontamination is needed. Furthermore, provision of information during the focus group study resulted in an increase in participants’ knowledge and confidence in taking recommended decontamination actions, which was maintained three months after the study. The longitudinal nature of these effects suggest that it may be possible to increase public awareness about actions to take during chemical incidents by developing pre-incident public education; however, further research is needed to examine this more fully.</description><published>1523653200000</published><title>Public perceptions of emergency decontamination: Effects of intervention type and responder management strategy during a focus group study</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dominique B.

Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, requires two phosphorylation steps to form a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. Adenylate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;) has been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate, while creatine kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;), pyruvate kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;) and pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cell (&lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt;) each have been found to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to the pharmacologically active tenofovir-diphosphate. In the present study, genomic DNA isolated from dried blood spots collected from 505 participants from Bangkok, Thailand; Cape Town, South Africa; and New York City, USA were examined for variants in &lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt; using next-generation sequencing. The bioinformatics tools SIFT and PolyPhen predicted that 19 of the 505 individuals (3.7% frequency) carried variants in at least one kinase that would result in a decrease or loss of enzymatic activity. To functionally test these predictions, AK2 and AK2 variants were expressed in and purified from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, followed by investigation of their activities towards tenofovir. Interestingly, we found that purified AK2 had the ability to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to tenofovir-diphosphate in addition to phosphorylating tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate. Further, four of the six AK2 variants predicted to result in a loss or decrease of enzyme function exhibited a ≥30% decrease in activity towards tenofovir in our in vitro assays. Of note, an AK2 K28R variant resulted in a 72% and 81% decrease in the formation of tenofovir-monophosphate and tenofovir-diphosphate, respectively. These data suggest that there are naturally occurring genetic variants that could potentially impact TFV activation.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Dominique B.

Background &lt;p&gt;A large number of programs have been implemented in many countries to increase the healthcare workforce recruitment in rural and remote areas. Rural early exposure programs for medical students have been shown to be effective strategies. However, no related studies have been reported before in China. This study was carried out to determine the association between medical students’ participation in rural clinical clerkships and their intentions to choose rural medical work after graduation from western medical schools in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on a two-stage random sampling method, the cross-sectional survey was carried out in ten western provinces in China. A brief questionnaire filled in by medical students was used for data collection. A total of 4278 medical students participated in the study. The response rate was approximately 90.34%. Pearson’s chi-squared tests and binary logistic regression analyses were performed for data analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Approximately 52.0% of medical students disclosed intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation. Only one in five participants had experience with a rural clinical clerkship. Rural clinical clerkships were significantly associated with medical students’ intentions to work in rural medical institutions (OR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.05–1.46); further analyses indicated that such clerkships only had a significant impact among the medical students with an urban background (OR: 2.10, 95%CI: 1.48–2.97). In terms of the sociodemographic characteristics, younger age, low level of parental education, majoring in general practice, and studying in low-level medical schools increased the odds of having intentions to engage in rural medical work among medical students; however, rural origins was the only positive univariate predictor. In addition, the predictors of intentions to choose rural medical work were different between medical students with a rural background and those with an urban background.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural clinical clerkship is likely to increase the odds of having intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation among medical students in western China, especially for those with an urban background. Related policy makers could consider developing compulsory rural clerkship programs and implement them among medical students to increase early rural exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Jinlin Liu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195266</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76933:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>f150cd78</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinlin Liu, Bin Zhu, Ying Mao&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives and methods &lt;p&gt;Using a randomized, crossover, counterbalanced approach, cyclists (N = 20, overnight fasted state) engaged in the four 75-km time trials (2-week washout) while ingesting two types of bananas with similar carbohydrate (CHO) but different phenolic content (Cavendish, CAV; mini-yellow, MIY, 63% higher polyphenols), a 6% sugar beverage (SUG), and water only (WAT). CHO intake was set at 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes. Blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Each of the CHO trials (CAV, MIY, SUG) compared to water was associated with higher post-exercise plasma glucose and fructose, and lower leukocyte counts, plasma 9+13 HODES, and IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra. OPLS-DA analysis showed that metabolic perturbation (N = 1,605 metabolites) for WAT (86.8±4.0 arbitrary units) was significantly greater and sustained than for CAV (70.4±3.9, P = 0.006), MIY (68.3±4.0, P = 0.002), and SUG (68.1±4.2, P = 0.002). VIP ranking (&amp;lt;3.0, N = 25 metabolites) showed that both CAV and MIY were associated with significant fold changes in metabolites including those from amino acid and xenobiotics pathways. OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts showed a significant separation of CAV and MIY from both WAT and SUG (R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409). COX-2 mRNA expression was lower in both CAV and MIY, but not SUG, versus WAT at 21-h post-exercise in THP-1 monocytes cultured in plasma samples.

Background &lt;p&gt;The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively.

Echinoderms are capable of asexual reproduction by fission. An individual divides into parts due to changes in the strength of connective tissue of the body wall. The structure of connective tissue and the mechanisms of variations in its strength in echinoderms remain poorly studied. An analysis of transcriptomes of individuals during the process of fission provides a new opportunity to understand the mechanisms of connective tissue mutability. In the holothurian &lt;i&gt;Cladolabes schmeltzii&lt;/i&gt;, we have found a rather complex organization of connective tissue. Transcripts of genes encoding a wide range of structural proteins of extracellular matrix, as well as various proteases and their inhibitors, have been discovered. All these molecules may constitute a part of the mechanism of connective tissue mutability. According to our data, the extracellular matrix of echinoderms is substantially distinguished from that of vertebrates by the lack of elastin, fibronectins, and tenascins.

Echinoderms are capable of asexual reproduction by fission. An individual divides into parts due to changes in the strength of connective tissue of the body wall. The structure of connective tissue and the mechanisms of variations in its strength in echinoderms remain poorly studied. An analysis of transcriptomes of individuals during the process of fission provides a new opportunity to understand the mechanisms of connective tissue mutability. In the holothurian &lt;i&gt;Cladolabes schmeltzii&lt;/i&gt;, we have found a rather complex organization of connective tissue. Transcripts of genes encoding a wide range of structural proteins of extracellular matrix, as well as various proteases and their inhibitors, have been discovered. All these molecules may constitute a part of the mechanism of connective tissue mutability. According to our data, the extracellular matrix of echinoderms is substantially distinguished from that of vertebrates by the lack of elastin, fibronectins, and tenascins. In case of fission, a large number of genes of transcription factors and components of different signaling pathways are expressed. Products of these genes are probably involved in regulation of asexual reproduction, connective tissue mutability, and preparation of tissues for subsequent regeneration. It has been shown that holothurian tensilins are a special group of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which has formed within the class Holothuroidea and is absent from other echinoderms. Our data can serve a basis for the further study of the mechanisms of extracellular matrix mutability, as well as the mechanisms responsible for asexual reproduction in echinoderms.</description><published>1523566800000</published><title>Molecular mechanisms of fission in echinoderms: Transcriptome analysis</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-k?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-k?rss=1</link><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523554636000</published><author><name>Hurtley, S.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30–59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact.

Our first aim was to compare the anaerobic threshold (AnT) determined by the incremental protocol with the reverse lactate threshold test (RLT), investigating the previous cycling experience effect. Secondarily, an alternative RLT application based on heart rate was proposed. Two groups (12 per group-according to cycling experience) were evaluated on cycle ergometer. The incremental protocol started at 25 W with increments of 25 W at each 3 minutes, and the AnT was calculated by bissegmentation, onset of blood lactate concentration and maximal deviation methods. The RLT was applied in two phases: a) lactate priming segment; and b) reverse segment; the AnT (AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt;) was calculated based on a second order polynomial function. The AnT from the RLT was calculated based on the heart rate (AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt;) by the second order polynomial function. In regard of the Study 1, most of statistical procedures converged for similarity between the AnT determined from the bissegmentation method and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt;. For 83% of non-experienced and 75% of experienced subjects the bias was 4% and 2%, respectively. In Study 2, no difference was found between the AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt; and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt;. For 83% of non-experienced and 91% of experienced subjects, the bias between AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt; and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt; was similar (i.e. 6%). In summary, the AnT determined by the incremental protocol and RLT are consistent. The AnT can be determined during the RLT via heart rate, improving its applicability. However, future studies are required to improve the agreement between variables.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Leonardo Henrique Dalcheco Messias</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194313</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d6d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>f1393110</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leonardo Henrique Dalcheco Messias, Emanuel Elias Camolese Polisel, Fúlvia Barros Manchado-Gobatto&lt;/p&gt;

Cerium (Ce) belongs to the rare earth elements (REEs), and although it is not essential for plants, it can stimulate growth and other physiological processes. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of Ce on seed germination, initial seedling growth, and vegetative growth in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) cv. Morelos A-98. During the germination process, the seeds were treated with Ce concentrations of 0, 4, 8, and 12 μM; after 5 d, germination percentage was recorded and after 10 d seedling growth was measured. For vegetative growth, a hydroponic system was established where 14-d-old plants without previous Ce treatment were transferred into nutrient solution. After two weeks of acclimatizing, 0, 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce were added to the nutrient solution for 28 d. Ce significantly increased germination and the initial growth variables of the seedlings. During vegetative growth, Ce increased plant height, number of tillers, root volume, and shoot fresh and dry biomass, without affecting root biomass weight. With low Ce concentrations (25 and 50 μM), the concentrations of chlorophylls and amino acids in the shoots were similar to those in the control, like amino acid concentration in the roots at a concentration of 25 μM Ce. Conversely, the concentration of total sugars increased in the shoot with the application of 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce, and in the roots with the application of 50 μM Ce. Also, Ce did not affect the concentration of macro or micronutrients in the shoots. However, in the roots, the high Ce concentration decreased the concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn, while the Mg concentration increased. Our results indicate that Ce, at the right concentrations, can function as a biostimulant in rice germination and growth.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Sara Monzerrat Ramírez-Olvera</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194691</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f1:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>97c046b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Monzerrat Ramírez-Olvera, Libia Iris Trejo-Téllez, Soledad García-Morales, Juan Antonio Pérez-Sato, Fernando Carlos Gómez-Merino&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Paraquat (PQ) poisoning can cause multiple organ failure, in which the lung is the primary target organ. There is currently no treatment for PQ poisoning. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which differentiate into multiple cell types, have generated much enthusiasm regarding their use for the treatment of several diseases. The aim of this study was to systematically review and analyze published preclinical studies describing MSC administration for the treatment of PQ poisoning in animal models to provide a basis for cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The electronic databases PubMed and CBMdisc were searched in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The MSC treatment characteristics of animal models of PQ poisoning were summarized. After quality assessment was performed, the effects of MSC transplantation were evaluated based on the survival rate, lung wet/dry weight, fibrosis scores, oxidative stress response, and inflammatory response. Publication bias was assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eleven controlled preclinical studies involving MSC transplantation in animal models of PQ poisoning were included in this review. MSC therapy improved the survival rate and reduced the lung wet/dry weight and histopathological fibrosis changes in most studies. MSCs decreased serum or plasma malondialdehyde levels in the acute phase after 7 and 14 d and increased serum or plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels at the same time points. IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels in blood or lung tissues were decreased to different degrees by MSCs. Lung hydroxyproline was decreased by MSCs after 14 d. No obvious evidence of publication bias was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;MSCs showed anti-fibrosis therapeutic effects in animal models of lung injury caused by PQ poisoning, which may be related to reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine levels.

The goal of this study was to evaluate survival of important viral pathogens of livestock in animal feed ingredients imported daily into the United States under simulated transboundary conditions. Eleven viruses were selected based on global significance and impact to the livestock industry, including Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV), Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), Influenza A Virus of Swine (IAV-S), Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Nipah Virus (NiV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Swine Vesicular Disease Virus (SVDV), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) and Vesicular Exanthema of Swine Virus (VESV). Surrogate viruses with similar genetic and physical properties were used for 6 viruses. Surrogates belonged to the same virus families as target pathogens, and included Senecavirus A (SVA) for FMDV, Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) for CSFV, Bovine Herpesvirus Type 1 (BHV-1) for PRV, Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) for NiV, Porcine Sapelovirus (PSV) for SVDV and Feline Calicivirus (FCV) for VESV. For the remaining target viruses, actual pathogens were used. Virus survival was evaluated using Trans-Pacific or Trans-Atlantic transboundary models involving representative feed ingredients, transport times and environmental conditions, with samples tested by PCR, VI and/or swine bioassay. SVA (representing FMDV), FCV (representing VESV), BHV-1 (representing PRV), PRRSV, PSV (representing SVDV), ASFV and PCV2 maintained infectivity during transport, while BVDV (representing CSFV), VSV, CDV (representing NiV) and IAV-S did not. Notably, more viruses survived in conventional soybean meal, lysine hydrochloride, choline chloride, vitamin D and pork sausage casings. These results support published data on transboundary risk of PEDV in feed, demonstrate survival of certain viruses in specific feed ingredients (“high-risk combinations”) under conditions simulating transport between continents and provide further evidence that contaminated feed ingredients may represent a risk for transport of pathogens at domestic and global levels.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Scott A.

For organisms with complex life histories, carry-over effects (COEs) can manifest between life stages, when conditions experienced by one stage influence the next, as well as trans-generationally, when the parental environment affects offspring. Here we used multiple global change-associated stressors to examine both forms of COE simultaneously in an intertidal limpet with mixed development (i.e. planktonic larvae hatch from benthic egg masses). Adult &lt;i&gt;Siphonaria australis&lt;/i&gt; were subjected to four treatments over four weeks: an ambient control, a treatment featuring elevated water temperature (25°C) and UVB (1.7 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;), a copper pollution treatment (5.0 μg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and a treatment incorporating all three stressors. Egg masses laid by these adults were then redistributed among the same four treatments (producing 16 adult-to-egg treatment histories) and stressed until hatching. Finally, hatching larvae were reared under ambient conditions for 24 days. While adult survivorship was unaffected by treatment, embryonic viability in egg masses responded strongly to egg mass treatment, as well as parental stress exposure, therefore displaying trans-generational COEs. These trans-generational COEs interacted with COEs originating in egg masses to produce highly context-dependent hatching sizes and larval growth. This demonstrates that the performance of a given organism at a given time reflects not only conditions experienced during embryonic development, but also those of the parental generation, and suggests that COEs play an important but underestimated role in responses to global change scenarios.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Gustav M.

Knowing brain connectivity is of great importance both in basic research and for clinical applications. We are proposing a method to infer directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity recorded at multiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations that are reflected in neuronal population activity. To derive our strategy, we assume a generic linear model of interacting continuous variables, the components of which represent the activity of local neuronal populations. The suggested method for inferring connectivity from recorded signals exploits the fact that the covariance matrix derived from the observed activity contains information about the existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a sparsely coupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal structure via &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-minimization, which is known to prefer sparse solutions. In general, this method is suited to infer effective connectivity from resting state data of various types. We show that our method is applicable over a broad range of structural parameters regarding network size and connection probability of the network. We also explored parameters affecting its activity dynamics, like the eigenvalue spectrum. Also, based on the simulation of suitable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to model BOLD dynamics, we show that with our method it is possible to estimate directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances derived from such signals. In this study, we consider measurement noise and unobserved nodes as additional confounding factors. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of data required for a reliable estimate. Additionally, we apply the proposed method on full-brain resting-state fast fMRI datasets. The resulting network exhibits a tendency for close-by areas being connected as well as inter-hemispheric connections between corresponding areas. In addition, we found that a surprisingly large fraction of more than one third of all identified connections were of inhibitory nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQUjBd7KMBU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</href></item></canonical><engagement>31</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006056</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b8:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><fingerprint>cc3e5fdc</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Schiefer, Alexander Niederbühl, Volker Pernice, Carolin Lennartz, Jürgen Hennig, Pierre LeVan, Stefan Rotter&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, we found that a surprisingly large fraction of more than one third of all identified connections were of inhibitory nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQUjBd7KMBU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522095842894</recrawled><published>1522098000000</published><title>From correlation to causation: Estimating effective connectivity from zero-lag covariances of brain signals</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/G2gcPym6w-o/s41598-018-23960-9</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23960-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/G2gcPym6w-o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Dong Yun Choi</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162aed81c76:1bbfa82:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523351821430</crawled><fingerprint>95e1240</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23960-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23960-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/G2gcPym6w-o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1523343600000</published><title>Al-Coated Conductive Fiber Filters for High-Efficiency Electrostatic Filtration: Effects of Electrical and Fiber Structural Properties</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00241</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>264</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00241/20180403/images/medium/bi-2018-00241f_0008.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00241</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/w7_1uUuu2Bs/acs.biochem.8b00241</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522728000000</published><author><name>Qi Gao, Jeong-Yeh Yang, Kelley W.

In the present study, we examined the effects of different drying conditions on the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages. We approached this objective by comparing invertebrate assemblages in perennial and intermittent sites along two intermittent Mediterranean streams with contrasting predictability, duration, and spatial patterns of drying: Fuirosos (high predictability, short duration, downstream drying pattern) and Rogativa (low predictability, long duration, patchy drying pattern). Specifically, we quantified the contribution of individual taxa to those differences, the degree of nestedness, and shifts in the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages along flow intermittence gradients. We observed greater effects of drying on the benthic invertebrate composition in Fuirosos than in Rogativa, resulting in a higher dissimilarity of assemblages between perennial and intermittent sites, as well as a lower degree of nestedness. Furthermore, a higher number of biotic metrics related to richness, abundance and biological traits were significantly different between perennial and intermittent sites in Fuirosos, despite a shorter dry period compared to Rogativa. At the same time, slightly different responses were detected during post-drying (autumn) than pre-drying (spring) conditions in this stream. In Rogativa, shifts in benthic invertebrate assemblages along increasing gradients of flow intermittence were found for three metrics (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and Odonata, Coleoptera and Heteroptera (OCH) abundances and aerial active dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined gradients of dry period duration and distance to nearest perennial reach can generate complex, and different, responses of benthic invertebrate assemblages, depending on the flow intermittence metric. Our study advances the notion that special attention should be paid to the predictability, duration and spatial patterns of drying in intermittent streams in order to disentangle the effects of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages, in particular in areas subject to high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in drying conditions.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>María Mar Sánchez-Montoya</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193933</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2807:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>2ad5a22a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Mar Sánchez-Montoya, Daniel von Schiller, Gonzalo G.

The burden of depression and anxiety disorders is greater in women, and female sex hormones have been shown to affect mood. Psychological side effects of hormonal contraception (HC) are also a common complaint in the clinic, but few previous studies have investigated this subject. We therefore wanted to investigate whether use of HC was associated with adverse psychological health outcomes, and whether this association was modified by age. All women aged 12–30 years on 31 December 2010, residing in Sweden for at least four years and with no previous psychiatric morbidity (n = 815 662), were included. We followed the women from their first HC use (or 31 December 2010, if they were non-users) at baseline, until a prescription fill of psychotropic drugs or the end of the one-year follow-up. We performed age-stratified logistic regression models and estimated odds ratios (OR) to measure the association between different HC methods and psychotropic drug use, as well as the area under the receiver operating curve to estimate discriminatory accuracy of HC in relation to psychotropic drugs. Overall, we found an association between HC and psychotropic drugs (adjusted OR 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.37). In the age-stratified analysis, the strongest association was found in adolescent girls (adjusted OR 3.46, 95% CI 3.04–4.94 for age 12 to 14 years), while it was non-existent for adult women. We conclude that hormonal contraception is associated with psychotropic drug use among adolescent girls, suggesting an adverse effect of HC on psychological health in this population.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Sofia Zettermark</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194773</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b1:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>6b2f05c2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Zettermark, Raquel Perez Vicente, Juan Merlo&lt;/p&gt;

Many new applications in drug discovery and functional genomics require capturing the morphology of individual cells as comprehensively as possible. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn powerful visual representations, but require ground truth for training; this is rarely available in biomedical profiling experiments. While we do not know which experimental treatments produce cells that look alike, we do know that cells exposed to the same experimental treatment should generally look similar. Thus, we explore training CNNs using a weakly supervised approach that uses this information for feature learning.

Many new applications in drug discovery and functional genomics require capturing the morphology of individual cells as comprehensively as possible. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn powerful visual representations, but require ground truth for training; this is rarely available in biomedical profiling experiments. While we do not know which experimental treatments produce cells that look alike, we do know that cells exposed to the same experimental treatment should generally look similar. Thus, we explore training CNNs using a weakly supervised approach that uses this information for feature learning. In addition, the training stage is regularized to control for unwanted variations using mixup or RNNs. We conduct experiments on two different datasets; the proposed approach yields single-cell embeddings that are more accurate than the widely adopted classical features, and are competitive with previously proposed transfer learning approaches.</description><published>1522652400000</published><title>Weakly supervised learning of single-cell feature embeddings [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3087.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3087.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3087.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Selection of functional spermatozoa plays a crucial role in assisted reproduction.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition driven by loss of homeostasis between the mucosal immune system, the commensal gut microbiota, and the intestinal epithelium. Our goal is to understand how these components of the intestinal ecosystem cooperate to control homeostasis. By combining quantitative measures of epithelial hyperplasia and immune infiltration with multivariate analysis of inter- and intracellular signaling, we identified epithelial mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as a potential driver of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. A kinetic analysis of mTOR inhibition revealed that the pathway regulates epithelial differentiation, which in turn controls the cytokine milieu of the colon. Consistent with our in vivo analysis, we found that cytokine expression of organoids grown ex vivo, in the absence of bacteria and immune cells, was dependent on differentiation state. Our study suggests that proper differentiation of epithelial cells is an important feature of colonic homeostasis because of its effect on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZpVf1yiGbfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002417</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002417</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16272e5d344:b6d48:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522346087236</crawled><fingerprint>2d344ab2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jesse Lyons, Phaedra C.

Scant research is available on the impact of the current economic crisis and austerity policies on inequality in health services utilisation in Europe. This study aimed to describe the trends in horizontal inequity in the use of health services in Andalusia, Spain, during the early years of the Great Recession, and the contribution of demographic, economic and social factors. Consultation with a general practitioner (GP) and specialist, hospitalisation and emergency care were studied through the Andalusian Health Survey 2007 (pre-crisis) and 2011–2012 (crisis), using a composite income index as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. Horizontal inequity indices (HII) were calculated to take differential healthcare needs into account, and a decomposition analysis of change in inequality between periods was performed. Results showed that before the crisis, the HII was positive (greater access for people with higher SES) for specialist visits but negative (greater access for people with lower SES) in the other three utilisation models. During the crisis no change was observed in inequalities in GP visits, but a pro-poor development was seen for the other types of utilisation, with hospital and emergency care showing significant inequality in favour of low income groups. Overall, the main contributors to pro-poor changes in utilisation were socio-economic variables and poor mental health, due to changes in their elasticities. Our findings show that inequalities in healthcare utilisation largely remained in favour of the less well-off, despite the cuts in welfare benefits and health services provision during the early years of the recession in Andalusia. Further research is needed to monitor the potential impact of such measures in subsequent years.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Juan Antonio Córdoba-Doña</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195293</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c5a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>d99bca9c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Antonio Córdoba-Doña, Antonio Escolar-Pujolar, Miguel San Sebastián, Per E.
