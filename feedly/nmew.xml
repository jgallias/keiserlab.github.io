Objective &lt;p&gt;Different phenotypes of wheezing have been described to date but not in early life. We aim to describe wheezing phenotypes between the ages of two months and one year, and assess risk factors associated with these wheezing phenotypes in a large birth cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 18,041 infants from the ELFE (French Longitudinal Study of Children) birth cohort. Parents reported wheezing and respiratory symptoms at two and 12 months, and answered a complete questionnaire (exposure during pregnancy, parental allergy).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Children with no symptoms (controls) accounted for 77.2%, 2.1% had had wheezing at two months but no wheezing at one year (intermittent), 2.4% had persistent wheezing, while 18.3% had incident wheezing at one year. Comparing persistent wheezing to controls showed that having one sibling (ORa = 2.19) or 2 siblings (ORa = 2.23) compared to none, nocturnal cough (OR = 5.2), respiratory distress (OR = 4.1) and excess bronchial secretions (OR = 3.47) at two months, reflux in the child at 2 months (OR = 1.55), maternal history of asthma (OR = 1.46) and maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.57) were significantly associated with persistent wheezing. These same factors, along with cutaneous rash in the child at 2 months (OR = 1.13) and paternal history of asthma (OR = 1.32) were significantly associated with increased odds of incident wheezing. Having one sibling (ORa = 1.9) compared to none, nocturnal cough at 2 months (OR = 1.76) and excess bronchial secretions at 2 months (OR = 1.65) were significantly associated with persistent compared to intermittent wheezing.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Respiratory symptoms (cough, respiratory distress, and excessive bronchial secretion) were significantly associated with a high risk of persistent wheezing at one year.

The prevalence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly. Probiotics supplementation have been shown to improve metabolic health in humans. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health and pregnancy complications in pregnant women. The literature search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed, and data were synthesized in accordance with standardized guidelines. Ten randomized clinical trials with eligible data were included in our meta-analysis. For pregnant women with GDM, we found negative correlations between probiotics supplementation and fasting serum insulin (OR -2.94, 95%CI [-5.69, -0.20], p = 0.04) and homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (OR -0.65, 95%CI [-1.18, -0.11], p = 0.02). There were no significant correlations between probiotics supplementation and lipid levels in women with GDM, including total cholesterol (OR -2.72, 95%CI [-17.18, 11.74], P = 0.71), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (OR -0.29, 95%CI [-3.60, 3.03], P = 0.87), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (OR -0.38, 95%CI [-18.54, 17.79], P = 0.97), or triglycerides (OR -12.83, 95%CI [-36.63, 10.97], P = 0.29). For healthy pregnant women, probiotics supplementation were negatively associated with fasting serum insulin (OR -3.76, 95%CI [-4.29, -3.23], P &amp;lt; 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (OR -0.57, 95%CI [-1.08, -0.06], p = 0.03). However, no significant correlations were observed between probiotics supplementation and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (OR -2.02, 95%CI [-5.56, 1.52], p = 0.26). Thus, our study revealed that probiotics supplementation during pregnancy have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, rather than lipid metabolism among pregnant women.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jia Zheng, Qianyun Feng, Sheng Zheng, Xinhua Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Effective HIV prevention requires efficient delivery of safe and efficacious drugs and optimization of user adherence. The user’s experiences with the drug, delivery system, and use parameters are critical to product acceptability and adherence. Prevention product developers have the opportunity to directly control a drug delivery system and its impact on acceptability and adherence, as well as product efficacy. Involvement of potential users during preclinical design and development can facilitate this process. We embedded a mixed methods user evaluation study into a safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) trial of a pod-intravaginal ring delivering antiretroviral agents.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Women enrolled in two cohorts, ultimately evaluating the safety/PK of a pod-IVRs delivering TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, and/or TDF-FTC-MVC. A 7-day use period was targeted for each pod-IVR, regardless of drug or drug combination. During the clinical study, participants provided both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., in-depth interview) data capturing acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence behaviors. Initial sexual and reproductive health history surveys, daily diaries, a final acceptability and willingness to use survey, and a qualitative in-depth interview comprised the user evaluation data for each pod-IVR experienced by the participants.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Overall, the majority of participants (N = 10) reported being willing to use the pod-IVR platform for HIV prevention should it advance to market. Confidence to use the pod-IVR (e.g., insertion, removal) was high. There were no differences noted in the user experience of the pod-IVR platform; that is, whether the ring delivered TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, or TDF-FTC-MVC, users’ experiences of the ring were similar and acceptable. Participants did report specific experiences, both sensory and behavioral, that impacted their use behaviors with respect to the ring, and which could ultimately impact acceptability and adherence. These experiences, and user evaluations elicited by them, could both challenge use or be used to leverage use in future trials and product rollout once fully articulated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High willingness-to-use data and lack of salient differences in user experiences related to use of the pod-IVR platform (regardless of agents delivered) suggests that the pod-IVR is a feasible and acceptable drug delivery device in and of itself. This finding holds promise both for an anti-HIV pod-IVR and, potentially, a multipurpose prevention pod-IVR that could deliver both prevention for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and contraception. Given the very early clinical trial context, further acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence data should continue to be explored, in the context of longer use periods (e.g., 28-day ring use), and in the contexts of sexual activity and menses. Using early design and development contexts to gain insights into potential challenges and facilitators of drug delivery systems such as the pod-IVR could save valuable resources and time as a potential biomedical technology moves through the clinical trial pipeline and into real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kate M.

This study examined how people evaluate ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors, especially their predictions of the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors (Study 1). Further, it examined the individual effects of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors of an actor on the evaluation of his/her trait by considering the cases where the actor engages in and does not engage in the other behavior (Study 2). Study 1 revealed that the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors was perceived asymmetrically. Specifically, while the likelihood of ordinary prosocial actors to engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors was perceived as high, the same perception was not observed for extraordinary prosocial behaviors. On the other hand, extraordinary prosocial actors were perceived as highly likely to engage in both ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Study 2 revealed that the evaluation of actors who engaged in extraordinary prosocial behaviors but not ordinary prosocial behaviors did not exceed the evaluation of actors who engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors but not extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Additionally, the effect of extraordinary prosocial behaviors was more when the actor also engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors. These results suggest that extraordinary prosocial actors are evaluated highly when they also engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ikumi Futamura&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last decades, the treatment of schizophrenia has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. In this study, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on social cognitive and nonsocial neurocognitive functions, as well as on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, in individuals with schizophrenia. Thirty-seven individuals with schizophrenia were administered one of three different tDCS conditions (cathodal, anodal, and sham) per visit over the course of three visits, with approximately one week between each visit. Order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. For the active conditions, the electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the reference electrode over right supraorbital cortex. Current intensity was 2 mA and was maintained for two 20-minute sessions, with a one hour break between the sessions. Assessments were conducted immediately following each session, in a counterbalanced order of administration. No systematic effects were found across the social and nonsocial cognitive domains, and no significant effects were detected on event-related potentials (ERPs). The very small effect sizes, further validated by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; power analyses (large Critical Ns), demonstrated that these findings were not due to lack of statistical power. Except for mild local discomfort, no significant side effects were reported. Findings demonstrate the safety and ease of administration of this procedure, but suggest that a single dose of tDCS over these areas does not yield a therapeutic effect on cognition in schizophrenia.

Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) producing carbapenemases are increasing at an alarming speed. Rapid confirmation of carbapenemase type will be an important diagnostic step in clinical microbiology laboratories not only to reduce the risk of transmissions but also for optimising antibiotic therapy in the future. We compared diagnostic reliability of two commercially available molecular assays (Check-Direct CPE vs. AID line probe assay) for detection and typing of carbapenemase genes in 80 well-characterized isolates of MDR-GNB. Respective strains were isolated in various clinical specimens at our clinical microbiology laboratory. The reference standard included confirmation of carbapenemase-production at the molecular level at the German National Reference Laboratory for Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany). 53 &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and 27 members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex were used in this study. The tested assays appeared highly reliable to confirm carbapenemase-producing &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; (CPE) with respective sensitivities of 97.7%, but are currently unsuitable for analysis of members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex. Both assays are easy to perform and rapid tools for confirmation and typing of the most common carbapenemase genes in &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;.

These results establish the brain-wide direct inputs of two major types of striatal interneurons and allude to distinct roles in regulating striatal activity and controlling behavior.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>Differential inputs to striatal cholinergic and parvalbumin interneurons imply functional distinctions</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35657</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162f25c289d:5deee43:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1524484548765</crawled><published>1524441600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35962</link><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35962</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35962</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>alauring@med.umich.edu (Adam S Lauring)</name></author><description>The evolutionary dynamics of influenza virus ultimately derive from processes that take place within and between infected individuals.

Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated information (Φ), and showing that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible &lt;i&gt;black boxes&lt;/i&gt;. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nmwWC-o9ix4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Giulio Tononi&lt;/p&gt;

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) are indicated as first-line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Erlotinib is also used in second and third-line therapy for patients whose tumors have wild type EGFR but to date there are no validated biomarkers useful to identify which patients may benefit from this treatment. The expression level of four miRNAs: miR-133b, -146a, -7 and -21 which target EGFR was investigated by real-time PCR in tumor specimens from NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib administered as the second or third line. We found that miR-133b expression level better discriminated responder from non-responder patients to erlotinib. Higher levels of miR-133b in NSCLCs were associated with longer progression-free survival time of patients. Functional analyses on miR-133b through transfection of a miR-133b mimic in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines indicated that increasing miR-133b expression level led to a decreased cell growth and altered morphology but did not affect sensitivity to erlotinib. The detection of miR-133b expression levels in tumors help in the identification of NSCLC patients with a better prognosis and who are likely to benefit from second and third-line therapy with erlotinib.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alessandra Bisagni, Maria Pagano, Sally Maramotti, Francesca Zanelli, Martina Bonacini, Elena Tagliavini, Luca Braglia, Massimiliano Paci, Andrea Mozzarelli, Stefania Croci&lt;/p&gt;

Calcium is an important second messenger in plants that is released into the cytosol early after recognition of various environmental stimuli. Decoding of such calcium signals by calcium sensors is the key for the plant to react appropriately to each stimulus. Several members of Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) act as calcium sensors and some are known to mediate both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; CML9 in different stress responses. CML9 was reported earlier as defense regulator against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast to salicylic acid-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;syringae&lt;/i&gt;, defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic fungi are mediated by jasmonates. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; is induced upon wounding and feeding of the insect herbivore &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera littoralis&lt;/i&gt;. However, neither different &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutant lines nor overexpression lines were impaired upon insect feeding. No difference in herbivore-induced phytohormone elevation was detected in &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; lines. The defense against the spider mite &lt;i&gt;Tetranychus urticae&lt;/i&gt; was also unaffected. In addition, &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; mutant lines showed a wild type-like reaction to the necrotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;Alternaria brassicicola&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our data suggest that CML9 might be a regulator involved only in the defense against biotrophic pathogens, independent of jasmonates. In addition, our data challenge the involvement of CML9 in plant drought stress response. Taken together, we suggest that CML9 is a specialized rather than a general regulator of stress responses in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Monika Heyer, Sandra S.

This research identifies which shots types in goalball are most likely to lead to a goal and herby provides background information for improving training and competition. Therefore, we observed 117 elite level matches including 20,541 shots played in the regular situation (3 vs. 3) using notational analysis. We characterized the shots by using their target sector (A-E), technique (traditional, rotation), trajectory (flat, bounce), angle (straight, diagonal and outcome (goal, violation, out, blocked). In our data, a χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-test showed a significantly higher goal rate for men (3.9%) compared to women (3.0%). For men, we found a significantly higher goal rate in the intersection sectors between players C (5.6%), D (4.9%), and in the outer sector A. In sector A, goal rate was higher only for straight shots (6.6%). Technique and trajectory did not affect goal rate for men, but flat shots showed a higher violation rate (3.2%) compared to bounce shouts (2.0%). In women&apos;s goalball, goal rate was higher only on sector D (4.4%). Bounce-rotation shots were the most successful (5.5%). We conclude that men should focus on shots to sectors C and D (called pocket) and straight shots to sector A, as long as there are no other tactical considerations. Women should shoot primarily towards the pocket. It might also be worth playing more bounce-rotation shots and practicing them in training.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Link, Christoph Weber&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the accuracy and optimal cut-off point of self-diagnosis and clinical symptoms of seasonal influenza compared with rapid influenza diagnostic tests as the reference standard, we conducted a cross sectional observational study at a rural clinic in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data during three influenza seasons (December 2013 to April 2016) were retrospectively collected from the medical records and pre-examination sheets of 111 patients aged &gt;11 years (mean age 48.1 years, men 53.2%) who were suspected of influenza infection and underwent rapid influenza diagnostic testing. Patients’ characteristics (age, sex, and past medical history of influenza infection), clinical signs (axillary temperature, pulse rate, cough, joint and muscle pain, and history of fever [acute or sudden, gradual, and absence of fever]), duration from the onset of symptoms, severity of feeling sick compared with a common cold (severe, similar, and mild), self-reported likelihood of influenza (%), and results of rapid influenza diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At the optimal cut-off point (30%) for estimation of self-diagnosis of seasonal influenza, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.00) and negative likelihood ratio (LR–) was 0.57 (0.35 to 0.93). At a 10% cut-off point, LR–was 0.33 (0.12 to 0.96). At an 80% cut-off point, LR+ was 2.75 (0.75 to 10.07). As for clinical signs, the combination of acute or sudden onset fever and cough had LR+ of 3.27 (1.68 to 6.35). Absence of cough showed LR–of 0.15 (0.04 to 0.61).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Self-diagnosis of influenza using the optimal cut-off point (30%) was not found useful for ruling in or ruling out an influenza diagnosis. However, it could be useful when patients self-report extremely high (80%) or low (10%) probability of having influenza.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are one of the important factors in controlling gene expression and elucidation of their roles has been attracting great interest. We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Komura, Wataru Aoki, Keisuke Motone, Atsushi Satomura, Mitsuyoshi Ueda&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to determine the origin of soybeans is an important issue following the inclusion of this information in the labeling of agricultural food products becoming mandatory in South Korea in 2017. This study was carried out to construct a prediction model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybeans using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis. The optimal prediction models for discriminating soybean samples were obtained by selecting appropriate scaling methods, normalization methods, variable influence on projection (VIP) cutoff values, and wave-number regions. The factors for constructing the optimal partial-least-squares regression (PLSR) prediction model were using second derivatives, vector normalization, unit variance scaling, and the 4000–400 cm&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; region (excluding water vapor and carbon dioxide). The PLSR model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybean samples had the best predictability when a VIP cutoff value was not applied. When Chinese soybean samples were identified, a PLSR model that has the lowest root-mean-square error of the prediction value was obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5. The optimal PLSR prediction model for discriminating Korean soybean samples was also obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5. This is the first study that has combined FT-IR spectroscopy with normalization methods, VIP cutoff values, and selected wave-number regions for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybeans.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byeong-Ju Lee, Yaoyao Zhou, Jae Soung Lee, Byeung Kon Shin, Jeong-Ah Seo, Doyup Lee, Young-Suk Kim, Hyung-Kyoon Choi&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Higher prevalence of suicide notes could signify more conservatism in accounting and greater proneness to undercounting of suicide by method. We tested two hypotheses: (1) an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011–2013, the study population comprised registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome measure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning suicides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof.

The vertebrate neuroepithelium is composed of elongated progenitors whose reciprocal attachments ensure the continuity of the ventricular wall. As progenitors commit to differentiation, they translocate their nucleus basally and eventually withdraw their apical endfoot from the ventricular surface. However, the mechanisms allowing this delamination process to take place while preserving the integrity of the neuroepithelial tissue are still unclear. Here, we show that Notch signaling, which is classically associated with an undifferentiated state, remains active in prospective neurons until they delaminate. During this transition period, prospective neurons rapidly reduce their apical surface and only later down-regulate N-Cadherin levels. Upon Notch blockade, nascent neurons disassemble their junctions but fail to reduce their apical surface. This disrupted sequence weakens the junctional network and eventually leads to breaches in the ventricular wall. We also provide evidence that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) promotes differentiation by reducing Notch signaling through a &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition mechanism. However, during the delamination process, the ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1) transiently blocks this &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition and sustains Notch activity to defer differentiation. We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chooyoung Baek, Lucy Freem, Rosette Goïame, Helen Sang, Xavier Morin, Samuel Tozer&lt;/p&gt;

As progenitors commit to differentiation, they translocate their nucleus basally and eventually withdraw their apical endfoot from the ventricular surface. However, the mechanisms allowing this delamination process to take place while preserving the integrity of the neuroepithelial tissue are still unclear. Here, we show that Notch signaling, which is classically associated with an undifferentiated state, remains active in prospective neurons until they delaminate. During this transition period, prospective neurons rapidly reduce their apical surface and only later down-regulate N-Cadherin levels. Upon Notch blockade, nascent neurons disassemble their junctions but fail to reduce their apical surface. This disrupted sequence weakens the junctional network and eventually leads to breaches in the ventricular wall. We also provide evidence that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) promotes differentiation by reducing Notch signaling through a &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition mechanism. However, during the delamination process, the ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1) transiently blocks this &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition and sustains Notch activity to defer differentiation. We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>f39f2dd</fingerprint><recrawled>1525113004990</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Mib1 prevents Notch &amp;lt;i&gt;Cis&amp;lt;/i&gt;-inhibition to defer differentiation and preserve neuroepithelial integrity during neural delamination</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/OBYDT1hFD-8/article</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_1636572993c:15c405c:f3bf0074</id><crawled>1526415399228</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00170/20180515/images/medium/bi-2018-00170q_0006.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>259</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1526356800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00170</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00170</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00170</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jennifer R.

The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania infantum&lt;/i&gt; infection. In contrast, an antibody response against &lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-&lt;i&gt;Lu&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies. Dogs were classified into five groups based on serological and parasitological diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The following linear regression model was fitted: IgG level = mean + origin + sex + age + use of a repellent collar, and the residuals were assumed as pseudo-phenotypes for the association test between phenotypes and genotypes (GWA). A component of variance model that takes into account polygenic and sample structure effects (EMMAX) was employed for GWA. Phenotypic findings indicated that anti-SGH IgG levels remained higher in exposed and subclinically infected dogs than in severely diseased dogs even in regression model residuals. Five associated markers were identified on chromosomes 2, 20 and 31. The mapped genes included &lt;i&gt;CD180&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RP105&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MITF&lt;/i&gt; related to the rapid activation of B lymphocytes and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.

Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development. In human societies, however, there exists bias toward interacting with partners with similar characteristics, but not contributing globally. We study how complex interactive behaviors evolve under risks through proposing a threshold public goods game model. In the model, individuals either play games with participants who own the same phenotype, or contribute to the collective target of global public goods. We further introduce an insurance compensation mechanism into the model to probe the evolution of global cooperation. It is found that the introduction of the insurance remarkably promotes the emergence of global cooperative behavior and inhibits the tendency to play games only with individuals of the same phenotype. Besides, contrary to models without insurance, global cooperation is strengthened with the increase of imitation intensities. In addition, high risk and high threshold are in favor of global cooperation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinming Du&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To investigate the presence of changes in vibration detection and pressure pain threshold in patients with burning-mouth syndrome (BMS).&lt;/p&gt; Design of the study &lt;p&gt;Case-control study. The sample was composed of 30 volunteers, 15 with BMS and 15 in the control group. The pressure-pain threshold (PPT) and vibration-detection threshold (VDT) were examined. The clinical evaluation was complemented with the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) and Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI and BAI, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;BMS subjects showed a statistically significant higher PPT in the tongue (p = 0.002), right (p = 0.001) and left (p = 0.004) face, and a significant reduction of the VDT in the tongue (p = 0.013) and right face (p = 0.030). Significant differences were also found when comparing the PPT and the VDT of distinct anatomical areas. However, a significant interaction (group × location) was only for the PPT. BMS subjects also showed significantly higher levels of depression (p = 0.01), as measured by the BDI, compared to controls; and a significant inverse correlation between the VDT in the left face and anxiety levels was detected.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The study of somatosensory changes in BMS and its correlations with the clinical features as well as the levels of anxiety and depression expands current understanding of the neuropathic origin and the possible contribution of psychogenic factors related to this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brenda de Souza Moura, Natália dos Reis Ferreira, Marcos F.

Significant differences were also found when comparing the PPT and the VDT of distinct anatomical areas. However, a significant interaction (group × location) was only for the PPT. BMS subjects also showed significantly higher levels of depression (p = 0.01), as measured by the BDI, compared to controls; and a significant inverse correlation between the VDT in the left face and anxiety levels was detected.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The study of somatosensory changes in BMS and its correlations with the clinical features as well as the levels of anxiety and depression expands current understanding of the neuropathic origin and the possible contribution of psychogenic factors related to this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>c821649</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Changes in the vibration sensitivity and pressure pain thresholds in patients with burning mouth syndrome</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197834</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1636d6c4909:46d2daa:3dd877af</id><crawled>1526549203209</crawled><published>1526540400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04390-7</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04390-7</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04390-7</originId><engagement>136</engagement><author><name>Byungji Kim</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immunogene therapy with fusogenic nanoparticles modulates macrophage response to &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunogene therapy with fusogenic nanoparticles modulates macrophage response to &amp;lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04390-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04390-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In the context of increasing bacterial antibiotic-resistance, gene therapy that targets the immune system to clear infection is a major goal.

Understanding how knowledge is represented in the human brain is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. To date, most of the work on this topic has focused on knowledge representation in cortical areas and debated whether knowledge is represented in a distributed or localized fashion. Fang and colleagues provide evidence that brain connections and the white matter supporting such connections might play a significant role. The work opens new avenues of investigation, breaking through disciplinary boundaries across network neuroscience, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and classical lesion studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YwDVYOi5evM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franco Pestilli&lt;/p&gt;

Bifidobacteria colonize the human gastrointestinal tract, vagina, oral cavity and breast milk. They influence human physiology and nutrition through health-promoting effects, play an important role as primary colonizers of the newborn gut, and contribute to vaginal microbiome homeostasis by producing lactic acid. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which bifidobacteria are transmitted from mother to infant remains in discussion. Moreover, studies have suggested that &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt; spp. have specializations for gut colonization, but comparisons of strains of the same bifidobacteria species from different body sites are lacking. Here, our objective was to compare the genomes of &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium breve&lt;/i&gt; (n = 17) and &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium longum&lt;/i&gt; (n = 26) to assess whether gut and vaginal isolates of either species were distinguishable based on genome content. Comparison of the general genome features showed that vaginal and gut isolates did not differ in size, GC content, number of genes and CRISPR, either for &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;breve&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longum&lt;/i&gt;. Average nucleotide identity and whole genome phylogeny analysis revealed that vaginal and gut isolates did not cluster separately. Vaginal and gut isolates also had a similar COG (Cluster of Orthologous Group) category distribution. Differences in the accessory genomes between vaginal and gut strains were observed, but were not sufficient to distinguish isolates based on their origin. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the vaginal and gut microbiomes are colonized by a shared community of &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, and further emphasize the potential importance of the maternal vaginal microbiome as a source of infant gut microbiota.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aline C.

Tobacco (&lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabacum&lt;/i&gt;) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent protein kinase 1 (NtCDPK1) is involved in feedback regulation of the plant hormone gibberellin through the phosphorylation of the transcription factor, REPRESSION OF SHOOT GROWTH (RSG). Previously, Ser-6 and Thr-21 were identified as autophosphorylation sites in NtCDPK1. Autophosphorylation of Ser-6 and Thr-21 not only decreases the binding affinity of NtCDPK1 for RSG, but also inhibits the homodimerization of NtCDPK1. Furthermore, autophosphorylation decreases the phosphorylation efficiency of RSG. We demonstrated that Ser-6 and Thr-21 of NtCDPK1 are phosphorylated in response to GAs in plants. The substitution of these autophosphorylation sites with Ala enhances the NtCDPK1 overexpression-induced sensitization of seeds to a GA biosynthetic inhibitor during germination. These findings suggested that autophosphorylation of Ser-6 and Thr-21 prevents excessive phosphorylation of RSG. In this study, we attempted to determine which autophosphorylation site is responsible for the functional regulation of NtCDPK1. Ser-6 was autophosphorylated within 1 min, whereas Thr-21 required over 5 min to be completely autophosphorylated. Furthermore, we found that Ser-6 and Thr-21 were autophosphorylated by inter- and intramolecular mechanisms, respectively, which may be reflected in the faster autophosphorylation of Ser-6. Although both autophosphorylation sites were involved in the reduction of the binding affinity of NtCDPK1 for RSG and the inhibition of NtCDPK1 homodimerization, autophosphorylation of Ser-6 alone was sufficient to decrease the kinase activity of NtCDPK1 for RSG. These results suggest that autophosphorylation of Ser-6 is important for the rapid reduction of NtCDPK1 kinase activity for RSG, whereas that of Thr-21 may play an auxiliary role.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Ito, Sarahmi Ishida, Yohsuke Takahashi&lt;/p&gt;

These results suggest that autophosphorylation of Ser-6 is important for the rapid reduction of NtCDPK1 kinase activity for RSG, whereas that of Thr-21 may play an auxiliary role.</description><fingerprint>55182d9d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Autophosphorylation of Ser-6 via an intermolecular mechanism is important for the rapid reduction of NtCDPK1 kinase activity for substrate RSG</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196357</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba0:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><updated>1524517200000</updated><published>1524517200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196250</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196250</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196250</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Benjamin Schmuck</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schmuck, Mats Sandgren, Torleif Härd&lt;/p&gt;
Enzymatic functionalization of cross-β structured protein nanofibrils has hitherto resulted in a severe reduction of the catalytic efficiency of high turnover biocatalysts. It has been speculated that steric restrictions and mass transport pose limits on the attached enzymes, but detailed kinetics analyzing this have not yet been reported. For a more comprehensive understanding, we studied protein nanofibrils endowed with TEM1, a β-lactamase from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. The packing density of TEM1 along the fibrils was controlled by co-fibrillation; in other words, the N-terminal ureidosuccinate transporter Ure2(1–80) from &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; was simultaneously aggregated with the chimeric proteins TEM1-Ure2(1–80). The mature fibrils were trapped in a column, and the rate of ampicillin hydrolysis was recorded using a continuous substrate flow. The turnover rate was plotted as a function of substrate molecules available per enzyme per second, which demonstrated that an elevated substrate availability counteracts mass transport limitations. To analyze this data set, we derived a kinetic model, which makes it possible to easily characterize and compare enzymes packed in columns. The functional TEM1 nanofibrils possess 80% of the catalytic turnover rate compared to free TEM1 in solution. Altogether, we have created protein nanofibrils that can effectively hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotic contaminations and provided a groundwork strategy for other highly functional enzymatic nanofibrils.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schmuck, Mats Sandgren, Torleif Härd&lt;/p&gt;

Interleukin 17 (IL-17)–producing γδ T cells (γδ17 T cells) have been recently found to promote tumor growth and metastasis formation. How such γδ17 T-cell responses may be regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we report that tumor-associated neutrophils can display an overt antitumor role by strongly suppressing γδ17 T cells. Tumor-associated neutrophils inhibited the proliferation of murine CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells via induction of oxidative stress, thereby preventing them from constituting the major source of pro-tumoral IL-17 in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that low expression of the antioxidant glutathione in CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells renders them particularly susceptible to neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistently, superoxide deficiency, or the administration of a glutathione precursor, rescued CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T-cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, human Vδ1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ T cells, which contain most γδ17 T cells found in cancer patients, also displayed low glutathione levels and were potently inhibited by ROS. This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Mensurado, Margarida Rei, Telma Lança, Marianna Ioannou, Natacha Gonçalves-Sousa, Hiroshi Kubo, Marie Malissen, Venizelos Papayannopoulos, Karine Serre, Bruno Silva-Santos&lt;/p&gt;

Consistently, superoxide deficiency, or the administration of a glutathione precursor, rescued CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T-cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, human Vδ1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ T cells, which contain most γδ17 T cells found in cancer patients, also displayed low glutathione levels and were potently inhibited by ROS. This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>d05a552a</fingerprint><recrawled>1526060763996</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Tumor-associated neutrophils suppress pro-tumoral IL-17+ γδ T cells through induction of oxidative stress</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/dvsUoCba6KA/article</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162fc1023bf:27652d:91749e5b</id><crawled>1524647338943</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24750-z/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24750_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>368</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><published>1524639600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24750-z</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24750-z</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24750-z</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Takeshi Matsumoto</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Associations of obstructive sleep apnea with truncal skeletal muscle mass and density&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations of obstructive sleep apnea with truncal skeletal muscle mass and density, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24750-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24750-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Associations of obstructive sleep apnea with truncal skeletal muscle mass and density&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-N72J9HJMss&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Associations of obstructive sleep apnea with truncal skeletal muscle mass and density&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations of obstructive sleep apnea with truncal skeletal muscle mass and density, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24750-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24750-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Associations of obstructive sleep apnea with truncal skeletal muscle mass and density&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-N72J9HJMss&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>e2db3704</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Associations of obstructive sleep apnea with truncal skeletal muscle mass and density</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/-N72J9HJMss/s41598-018-24750-z</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3beee:2835af05</id><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><updated>1525899600000</updated><published>1525899600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197397</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197397</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197397</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Andrea Dechner</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Dechner, Kevin M.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with inflammation. We tried to investigate the influence of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and tocilizumab (TCZ) on the glucose metabolism of RA patients. RA patients in whom treatment with TNFi or TCZ was initiated from 2008 to 2015 were studied based on their medical records. We analyzed patients whose glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured both before and 3 months after the initiation of these biologic agents. The association between HbA1c reduction and the treatment was evaluated. From 971 cases treated with these biologic agents, 221 cases whose medical records of HbA1c were available, were included (TNFi, n = 154; TCZ, n = 67). Both the TNFi and TCZ groups had significantly lower HbA1c values at 1 month and 3 months after the initiation of treatment (TNFi, p&amp;lt;0.001; TCZ, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although the pretreatment HbA1c values did not differ (TNFi, 6.2%; TCZ, 6.2%; p = 0.532), the 3-month treatment HbA1c values were lower (TNFi, 6.1%; TCZ, 5.8%; p = 0.010) and the changes in HbA1c (ΔHbA1c) were greater (TNFi, 0.1%; TCZ, 0.4%; p&amp;lt;0.001) in the TCZ group. The reduction of HbA1c—defined by the achievement of a ΔHbA1c of ≥0.5%—was associated with baseline diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, baseline diabetes treatment, hospitalization, medical change during the observation period, and TCZ. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, TCZ was associated with the reduction of HbA1c in comparison to TNFi (adjusted OR = 5.59, 95% CI = 2.56–12.2; p&amp;lt;0.001). The HbA1c levels in RA patients were significantly lower after the initiation of TNFi or TCZ. Our study suggests that TCZ decreases the HbA1c levels in RA patients to a greater extent than TNFi.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yukimi Otsuka, Chikako Kiyohara, Yusuke Kashiwado, Takuya Sawabe, Shuji Nagano, Yasutaka Kimoto, Masahiro Ayano, Hiroki Mitoma, Mitsuteru Akahoshi, Yojiro Arinobu, Hiroaki Niiro, Koichi Akashi, Takahiko Horiuchi&lt;/p&gt;

Endometrial Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (endMSCs) are multipotent cells with immunomodulatory and pro-regenerative activity which is mainly mediated by a paracrine effect. The exosomes released by MSCs have become a promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. More specifically, extracellular vesicles derived from endMSCs (EV-endMSCs) have demonstrated a cardioprotective effect through the release of anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic factors. Here we hypothesize that EV-endMSCs may be used as a co-adjuvant to improve &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; fertilization outcomes and embryo quality. Firstly, endMSCs and EV-endMSCs were isolated and phenotypically characterized for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays. Then, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies were performed on murine embryos co-cultured with EV-endMSCs at different concentrations. Our results firstly demonstrated a significant increase on the total blastomere count of expanded murine blastocysts. Moreover, EV-endMSCs triggered the release of pro-angiogenic molecules from embryos demonstrating an EV-endMSCs concentration-dependent increase of VEGF and PDGF-AA. The release of VEGF and PDGF-AA by the embryos may indicate that the beneficial effect of EV-endMSCs could be mediating not only an increase in the blastocyst’s total cell number, but also may promote endometrial angiogenesis, vascularization, differentiation and tissue remodeling. In summary, these results could be relevant for assisted reproduction being the first report describing the beneficial effect of human EV-endMSCs on embryo development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebeca Blázquez, Francisco Miguel Sánchez-Margallo, Verónica Álvarez, Elvira Matilla, Nuria Hernández, Federica Marinaro, María Gómez-Serrano, Inmaculada Jorge, Javier G.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The participation of general practitioners (GPs) in primary care research is variable and often poor. We aimed to develop a substantive and empirical theoretical framework to explain GPs’ decision-making process to participate in research.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used the grounded theory approach to construct a substantive theory to explain the decision-making process of GPs to participate in research activities. Five in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted among 21 GPs. Purposeful sampling followed by theoretical sampling were used to attempt saturation of the core category. Data were collected using semi-structured open-ended questions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and checked prior to analysis. Open line-by-line coding followed by focus coding were used to arrive at a substantive theory. Memoing was used to help bring concepts to higher abstract levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The GPs’ decision to participate in research was attributed to their inner drive and appreciation for primary care research and their confidence in managing their social and research environments. The drive and appreciation for research motivated the GPs to undergo research training to enhance their research knowledge, skills and confidence. However, the critical step in the GPs’ decision to participate in research was their ability to align their research agenda with priorities in their social environment, which included personal life goals, clinical practice and organisational culture. Perceived support for research, such as funding and technical expertise, facilitated the GPs’ participation in research. In addition, prior experiences participating in research also influenced the GPs’ confidence in taking part in future research.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The key to GPs deciding to participate in research is whether the research agenda aligns with the priorities in their social environment.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking. Stride-to-stride variability of temporal gait parameters was also estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Walking speed, cadence or stride length were not different between PD and HS during linear walking. Speed, cadence and stride length diminished during curved walking in both groups, stride length more in PD than HS. In PD compared to HS, the stride length-cadence relationship was altered during curved walking. Duration of the double-support phase was also increased during curved walking, as was variability of the single support, swing phase and double support phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The spatio-temporal gait pattern and variability are significantly modified in well-treated, high-functioning patients with PD walking along circular trajectories, even when they exhibit no changes in speed in straight-line walking. The increased variability of the gait phases during curved walking is an identifying characteristic of PD. We discuss our findings in term of interplay between control of balance and of locomotor progression: the former is challenged by curved trajectories even in high-functioning patients, while the latter may not be critically affected.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Maria Turcato, Marco Godi, Marica Giardini, Ilaria Arcolin, Antonio Nardone, Andrea Giordano, Marco Schieppati&lt;/p&gt;

Team SA involves a common perspective between two or more individuals regarding current environmental events, their meaning, and projected future status. Team SA has been theorized to be important for resuscitation team effectiveness. Accordingly, multidimensional frameworks of observable behaviors relevant to resuscitation teams are needed to understand more deeply the nature of team SA, its implications for team effectiveness, and whether it can be trained. A seven-dimension team resuscitation SA framework was developed following a literature review and consensus process using a modified Delphi approach with a group of content experts. We applied a pre-post design within a day-long team training program involving four video-recorded simulated resuscitation events and 42 teams across Canada. The first and fourth events represented “pre” and “post” training events, respectively. Teams were scored on SA five times within each 15-minute event. Distractions were introduced to investigate whether SA scores would be affected. The current study provides initial construct validity evidence for a new measure of SA and explicates SA&apos;s role in resuscitation teams.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas A.

Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reflects cerebral perfusion and tissue oxygen consumption, which decline in some patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or stroke, especially during exercise. Its physiologic basis and clinical significance remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with oxygen transport physiology and known prognostic factors during both rest and exercise in patients with HFrEF or stroke. Thirty-four HFrEF patients, 26 stroke patients, and 17 healthy controls performed an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test using a bicycle ergometer. Integrated near-infrared spectroscopy and automatic gas analysis were used to measure cerebral tissue oxygenation and cardiac and ventilatory parameters. We found that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (rest; peak) were significantly lower in the HFrEF (66.3±13.3%; 63.4±13.8%,) than in the stroke (72.1±4.2%; 72.7±4.5%) and control (73.1±2.8%; 72±3.2%) groups. In the HFrEF group, SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at rest (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;) and peak SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;) were linearly correlated with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), peak oxygen consumption (V˙O2peak), and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; between -0.561 and 0.677, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Stepwise linear regression showed that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide at rest (P&lt;sub&gt;ET&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;), hemoglobin, and mean arterial pressure at rest (MAP&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) (adjusted R = 0.681, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; was mainly affected by peak carbon dioxide production (V˙CO2peak) (adjusted R = 0.653, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in patients with HFrEF. In conclusion, the study delineates the relationship of cerebral saturation and parameters associated with oxygen delivery. Moreover, SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; and SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt; are correlated with some well-recognized prognostic factors in HFrEF, suggesting its potential prognostic value.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Jen Chen, Jong-Shyan Wang, Chih-Chin Hsu, Pyng-Jing Lin, Feng-Chun Tsai, Ming-Shien Wen, Chi-Tai Kuo, Shu-Chun Huang&lt;/p&gt;

We analyze the model of social interactions with coevolution of the topology and states of the nodes. This model can be interpreted as a model of language change. We propose different rewiring mechanisms and perform numerical simulations for each. Obtained results are compared with the empirical data gathered from two online databases and anthropological study of Solomon Islands. We study the behavior of the number of languages for different system sizes and we find that only local rewiring, i.e. triadic closure, is capable of reproducing results for the empirical data in a qualitative manner. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomasz Raducha, Tomasz Gubiec&lt;/p&gt;

Immunogenicity is a major concern in drug development as anti-drug antibodies in many cases affect both patient safety and drug efficacy. Another concern is often the limited half-life of drugs, which can be altered by different chemical modifications, like acylation with fatty acids. However, acylation with fatty acids has been shown in some cases to modulate T cell activation. Therefore, to understand the role of acylation with fatty acids on immunogenicity we tested three immunogenic non-acylated peptides and 14 of their acylated analogues for binding to 26 common HLA class II alleles, and their ability to activate T cells in an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; T cell assay. Changes in binding affinity associated with acylation with fatty acids were typically modest, though a significant decrease was observed for influenza HA acylated with a stearic acid, and affinities for DQ alleles were consistently increased. Importantly, we showed that for all three immunogenic peptides acylation with fatty acids decreased their capacity to activate T cells, a trend particularly evident with longer fatty acids typically positioned within the peptide HLA class II binding core region, or when closer to the C-terminus. With these results we have demonstrated that acylation with fatty acids of immunogenic peptides can lower their stimulatory capacity, which could be important knowledge for drug design and immunogenicity mitigation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi S.

With these results we have demonstrated that acylation with fatty acids of immunogenic peptides can lower their stimulatory capacity, which could be important knowledge for drug design and immunogenicity mitigation.</description><fingerprint>301ad1eb</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>The effect of acylation with fatty acids and other modifications on HLA class II:peptide binding and T cell stimulation for three model peptides</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197407</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>bE0mPve90xtDW7Mgx9+xm/gIKXt54qktoOvefuUy0ZI=_16302bf7bbb:9ecb04:a96d255</id><crawled>1524759493563</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.8b00050/20180426/images/medium/ci-2018-00050s_0006.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>323</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1524715200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00050</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00050</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00050</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Fei Ye, Weiyao Zhang, Xiaoqing Ye, Jia Jin, Zhengbing Lv, Cheng Luo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.8b00050/20180426/images/medium/ci-2018-00050s_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00050&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Acute post-operative pain can remain untreated if patients cannot express themselves. The perfusion index (PI) may decrease when pain activates sympathetic tone and may increase after analgesics are administered. We evaluated if the perfusion index is a feasible indicator for objectively assessing pain relief in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and calculated the changes in PI measurements at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements to examine if the PI is a useful criterion for discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit. This retrospective observational study enrolled female patients who were admitted for gynecological or general surgery. The patients received general anesthesia and were admitted to the postanesthesia care unit. The PI, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded before and after administration of intravenous morphine. Changes in these parameters before and after analgesics were administered and the difference of these parameters between age and BMI subgroups were compared. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and %ΔPI and %ΔVAS were also evaluated. The percentage change in ΔPI (P9-T0/T0) of the patients at the time of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit relative to baseline PI measurements was calculated. Eighty patients were enrolled, and there were 123 instances during which analgesia was required. Heart rate, PI, and VAS score were significantly different before and after analgesics were administered (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The difference of parameters between age and BMI subgroups were not significant. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and the percentage change in ΔPI and ΔVAS showed weak correlations in age, BMI subgroups, and all measurements. The baseline PI and the PI when arriving at and when being discharged from the postanesthesia care unit were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The mean percentage change in Δ PI at the time of discharge from the PACU was 66.2%, and the 99% confidence interval was 12.2%~120.3%. The perfusion index was increased, and the VAS score was decreased significantly after analgesics were administered, but the correlation was weak in each subgroup. The VAS score is a subjective and psychometric parameter. The PI increased when partial pain relief was achieved after morphine was administered but did not reflect pain intensity or changes in the VAS score regardless of age or BMI. A percentage change in ΔPI at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements of greater than 12% can be used as a supplemental objective discharge criterion for pain assessment in the postanesthesia care unit.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chun-Lin Chu, Yi-You Huang, Ying-Hou Chen, Ling-Ping Lai, Huei-Ming Yeh&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;We aimed to clarify the factors associated with the presentation of erosive esophagitis (EE) symptoms in subjects undergoing health checkups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We utilized baseline data from 7,552 subjects who underwent upper endoscopy for health screening in a prospective, multicenter cohort study. The subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their upper abdominal symptoms and lifestyle.

Here, we parameterized the model to reproduce experimental solvation free energies of a set of small molecules. The model reproduces well‐experimental solvation free energies of 70 molecules, yielding a root mean square difference of 0.8 kcal/mol versus 2.5 kcal/mol for the CHARMM36 additive force field. The polarization work associated with the solute transfer from the gas‐phase to the polar solvent, a term neglected in the framework of additive force fields, was found to make a large contribution to the total solvation free energy, comparable to the polar solute–solvent solvation contribution. The Drude PB/SASA also reproduces well the electronic polarization from the explicit solvent simulations of a small protein, BPTI. Model validation was based on comparisons with the experimental relative binding free energies of 371 single alanine mutations. With the Drude PB/SASA model the root mean square deviation between the predicted and experimental relative binding free energies is 3.35 kcal/mol, lower than 5.11 kcal/mol computed with the CHARMM36 additive force field.

Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in &amp;lt; 30 min.

South Africa has a Universal Test and Treat (UTT) policy in place to ensure that everyone tests for HIV and can access treatment if they test positive. The aim of this study is to document the pathways that older South Africans who are living with HIV take to access testing and treatment in this context. Despite the aging of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and clear evidence that testing older persons (over age 50) is necessary, very little is known about the circumstances under which older persons test for HIV or their motivations for doing so. In this study, we analyze 21 qualitative, in-depth interviews with women and men aged 50 and over who are living with HIV from two townships outside of Cape Town. Using grounded theory to specify emerging themes, we find similarities and differences between older men and women in their pathways to testing. Men primarily test for HIV when their spouse is diagnosed or in connection with TB testing and treatment. Older women, who are more likely to be widowed or divorced, often test for HIV only when they are symptomatic or not responding appropriately to care for non-communicable diseases. Most importantly, we find that older South Africans do not seek testing as a response to risk. Instead, older men and women test only once they are symptomatic and referred by a provider, or as a result of a partner’s status. Our respondents, particularly the women, expressed “shock” and confusion at learning they were HIV-positive because they do not see themselves as at risk of acquiring HIV. Because the benefits of UTT are greatest with early detection and treatment, older persons’ tendency to test at such a late stage of illness decreases the individual and population level advantages of UTT. More research is needed to understand older persons’ risk and testing behavior so that policy and programs include HIV testing messages that reach this population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enid Schatz, Lucia Knight&lt;/p&gt;

More research is needed to understand older persons’ risk and testing behavior so that policy and programs include HIV testing messages that reach this population.</description><fingerprint>4cb79259</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>“I was referred from the other side”: Gender and HIV testing among older South Africans living with HIV</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196158</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162ff1b1b8e:7cf3ee:91749e5b</id><crawled>1524698389390</crawled><published>1524639600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/246835v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/25/246835</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/246835v1?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Zhu, H.</name></author><content><content>A significant fraction of most genomes is comprised of DNA sequences that have been incompletely investigated.

NAC proteins are a family of transcription factors which have a variety of important regulatory roles in plants. They present a very well conserved group of NAC subdomains in the N-terminal region and a highly variable domain at the C-terminus. Currently, knowledge concerning NAC family in the strawberry plant remains very limited. In this work, we analyzed the NAC family of &lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;, and a total of 112 NAC proteins were identified after we curated the annotations from the version 4.0.a1 genome. They were placed into the ligation groups (pseudo-chromosomes) and described its physicochemical and genetic features. A microarray transcriptomic analysis showed six of them expressed during the development and ripening of the &lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. Their expression patterns were studied in fruit (receptacle and achenes) in different stages of development and in vegetative tissues. Also, the expression level under different hormonal treatments (auxins, ABA) and drought stress was investigated. In addition, they were clustered with other NAC transcription factor with known function related to growth and development, senescence, fruit ripening, stress response, and secondary cell wall and vascular development. Our results indicate that these six strawberry NAC proteins could play different important regulatory roles in the process of development and ripening of the fruit, providing the basis for further functional studies and the selection for NAC candidates suitable for biotechnological applications.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enriqueta Moyano, Félix J.

During the development of the visual system, high levels of energy are expended propelling axons from the retina to the brain. However, the role of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism in the development of the visual system has been overlooked. Here, we report that the carbohydrate metabolites succinate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and their respective receptor—GPR91 and GPR99—are involved in modulating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections toward the thalamus during visual system development. Using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, combined with pharmacological and genetic analyses, we revealed that GPR91 and GPR99 are expressed on axons of developing RGCs and have complementary roles during RGC axon growth in an extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;)-dependent manner. However, they have no effects on axon guidance. These findings suggest an important role for these receptors during the establishment of the visual system and provide a foundational link between carbohydrate metabolism and axon growth.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N_QnsknNcYM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hosni Cherif, François Duhamel, Bruno Cécyre, Alex Bouchard, Ariane Quintal, Sylvain Chemtob, Jean-François Bouchard&lt;/p&gt;

These findings suggest an important role for these receptors during the establishment of the visual system and provide a foundational link between carbohydrate metabolism and axon growth.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N_QnsknNcYM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>84ce809</fingerprint><recrawled>1526579829417</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Receptors of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism, GPR91 and GPR99, mediate axon growth</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/N_QnsknNcYM/article</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_163184a4753:2a43e:c2c34441</id><crawled>1525120911187</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02320/20180430/images/medium/jp-2018-02320m_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>355</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1525060800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02320</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02320</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02320</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Andrés Arango-Restrepo, J.

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study investigated the prognostic role of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in patients with node negative, T1c triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from a nationwide cohort. In addition, the prognostic effect between 3 different chemotherapy regimens were compared in node-negative T1c TNBC patients by subgroup analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From the Korean breast cancer registry database, 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients were included in this study. Patients were categorized into four treatment groups according to chemotherapy regimen: (1) no chemotherapy, (2) adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), (3) adriamycin/epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU (FAC/FEC), and (4) cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU plus methotrexate (CMF). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated between each patient group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients, 1,006 received adjuvant chemotherapy, while 145 received no chemotherapy. Among the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy the distribution of regimens was: 586 AC, 168 FAC/FEC (126 FAC, 42 FEC), and 252 CMF. The mean follow-up time of the full study cohort was 87.98 ± 33.56 months (range = 6–192 months). Patients in the no chemotherapy group showed significantly worse OS compared to each chemotherapy regimen group. However, when OS was compared between each chemotherapy regimen, no significant difference was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study showed that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improved OS in T1c node negative TNBC patients, regardless of chemotherapy between AC, FAC/FEC, and CMF regimens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Taek Lim, Chan Heun Park, Sung Yong Kim, Seok Jin Nam, Eun Young Kang, Byung-In Moon, Hyouk Jin Lee, Ye Won Jeon, Hongki Gwak, Young Jin Suh&lt;/p&gt;

The phytohormones auxin and cytokinin control development and maintenance of plant meristems and stem cell systems. Fluorescent protein reporter lines that monitor phytohormone controlled gene expression programmes have been widely used to study development and differentiation in the model species Arabidopsis, but equivalent tools are still missing for the majority of crop species. Barley (&lt;i&gt;Hordeum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;) is the fourth most abundant cereal crop plant, but knowledge on these important phytohormones in regard to the barley root and shoot stem cell niches is still negligible. We have now analysed the role of auxin and cytokinin in barley root meristem development, and present fluorescent protein reporter lines that allow to dissect auxin and cytokinin signalling outputs in vivo. We found that application of either auxin or cytokinin to barley seedlings negatively impacts root meristem growth. We further established a barley cytokinin reporter, &lt;i&gt;TCSnew&lt;/i&gt;, which revealed significant cytokinin signalling in the stele cells proximal to the QC, and in the differentiated root cap cells. Application of exogenous cytokinin activated signalling in the root stem cell niche. Commonly employed auxin reporters DR5 or DR5v2 failed to respond to auxin in barley. However, analysis of putative auxin signalling targets barley PLETHORA1 (HvPLT1) is expressed in a similar pattern as its orthologue AtPLT1 from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. in the QC and the surrounding cells. Furthermore, the PINFORMED1 (HvPIN1) auxin efflux carrier was found to be expressed in root and shoot meristems, where it polarly localized to the plasma membrane.

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b00931&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, you can do hydrogenation reactions in a stainless-steel ball mill, without any sort of noble-metal catalyst. The hydrogen is produced when you add some n-alkane or diethyl ether to the mix (these actually get converted to gaseous methane and hydrogen under the milling conditions). Some pretty severe reductions are realized, for example, taking biphenyl all the way down to 1-cyclohexylcyclohexane. Olefins go to alkanes under these conditions, of course, and ketones and alcohols tend to just get erased: it’s a bulldozer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although it’s surprising, this reaction isn’t quite as much voodoo as it might appear. Well, not more than any other hydrogenation, anyway. The ball mill is, of course, a sealed vessel, and the authors show that the lower-boiling additives seem to be more effective, presumably because they increase the internal pressure. And it’s not like there’s no catalyst present, because you have the stainless steel. If you use zirconium oxide balls instead of the steel alloy ones, for example, you get no hydrogenation at all. Adding bits of different metals back in showed that the chromium is what’s producing the hydrogen from the alkanes or ether, while the nickel is acting as the hydrogenation catalyst itself. The stainless-steel alloy itself (304 steel) was the most effective combination, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balls do get eroded a bit under the conditions, so what you’ve got is finely divided metals, under some heat from the mechanical energy of the milling, and under hydrogen pressure from the decomposition of the co-reactants. No wonder things get reduced! But it’s not a reaction that you would have predicted up front. And even if you’d stipulated that hydrogenation would start under these conditions, I don’t think you would have guessed how powerful it would be. The last time I hydrogenated down a whole aryl system (it’s been a while), I was running at something like 1600 psi (110 bar) at 120C with a rhodium catalyst, and the stuff came out looking – and smelling – like old lawnmower oil. This reaction probably doesn’t get above 60 degrees, by contrast. Admittedly, there’s no word in the paper about the appearance or aroma of the crude products, but I’m willing to bet that that part remains the same. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>Here’s one to add to the “weird mechanosynthesis” pile.

The preference-performance hypothesis states that ovipositing phytophagous insects will select host plants that are well-suited for their offspring and avoid host plants that do not support offspring performance (survival, development and fitness). The mountain pine beetle (&lt;i&gt;Dendroctonus ponderosae&lt;/i&gt;), a native insect herbivore in western North America, can successfully attack and reproduce in most species of &lt;i&gt;Pinus&lt;/i&gt; throughout its native range. However, mountain pine beetles avoid attacking Great Basin bristlecone pine (&lt;i&gt;Pinus longaeva&lt;/i&gt;), despite recent climate-driven increases in mountain pine beetle populations at the high elevations where Great Basin bristlecone pine grows. Low preference for a potential host plant species may not persist if the plant supports favorable insect offspring performance, and Great Basin bristlecone pine suitability for mountain pine beetle offspring performance is unclear. We infested cut bolts of Great Basin bristlecone pine and two susceptible host tree species, limber (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexilis&lt;/i&gt;) and lodgepole (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;contorta&lt;/i&gt;) pines with adult mountain pine beetles and compared offspring performance. To investigate the potential for variation in offspring performance among mountain pine beetles from different areas, we tested beetles from geographically-separated populations within and outside the current range of Great Basin bristlecone pine. Although mountain pine beetles constructed galleries and laid viable eggs in all three tree species, extremely few offspring emerged from Great Basin bristlecone pine, regardless of the beetle population. Our observed low offspring performance in Great Basin bristlecone pine corresponds with previously documented low mountain pine beetle attack preference. A low preference-low performance relationship suggests that Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle is likely to be retained through climate-driven high-elevation mountain pine beetle outbreaks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erika L.

Benthic algae fuel summer food webs in many sunlit rivers, and are hotspots for primary and secondary production and biogeochemical cycling. Concerningly, riverine benthic algal assemblages can become dominated by toxic cyanobacteria, threatening water quality and public health. In the Eel River in Northern California, over a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin poisonings since 2000. During the summers of 2013–2015, we documented spatial and temporal patterns of cyanotoxin concentrations in the watershed, showing widespread distribution of anatoxin-a in benthic cyanobacterial mats. Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed weekly to record dissolved microcystin and anatoxin-a levels at 10 sites throughout the watershed, and 187 &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt;-dominated or &lt;i&gt;Phormidium-&lt;/i&gt;dominated cyanobacterial mat samples were collected from 27 locations to measure intracellular anatoxin-a (ATX) and microcystins (MCY). Anatoxin-a levels were higher than microcystin for both SPATT (mean MCY = 0.8 and ATX = 4.8 ng g resin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and cyanobacterial mat samples (mean MCY = 0.074 and ATX = 1.89 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). Of the benthic mats sampled, 58.9% had detectable anatoxin-a (max = 70.93 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), while 37.6% had detectable microcystins (max = 2.29 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). SPATT cyanotoxin levels peaked in mid-summer in warm mainstem reaches of the watershed.

Background &lt;p&gt;Expanding HIV screening for populations at risk necessitates testing in nontraditional settings. We assessed HIV testing in dental clinics in South Florida, an urban area with the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Aims &lt;p&gt;We explored patients’ acceptance of oral HIV rapid tests administered by dental providers and identified reasons for accepting or declining HIV testing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;During 2014 and 2015, dentists and hygienists at two federally qualified health center (FQHC) dental clinics who serve racial/ethnic minority patient populations in South Florida were trained to administer oral HIV rapid tests as a part of a routine dental visit. Patients presenting for dental services were offered a rapid HIV test and brief survey regarding their demographics, HIV testing history and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We enrolled 600 patients (median age = 43 years; IQR: 29–56 years), 45% non-Hispanic black and 35% Hispanic/Latino, 83% graduated high school, and 50% unemployed. Most (85%) accepted oral HIV rapid testing (none tested HIV-positive); 14% had never been tested for HIV. The most common reasons for testing were a desire to know HIV status (56%) and free testing (54%). Among 93 (15%) patients who declined testing, 58% were tested recently and 31% felt confident that they were HIV-negative; however, 74 (80%) who declined testing said they would feel comfortable discussing HIV prevention with their dentist. Additionally, 290 of 600 patients (48%) reported condomless vaginal or anal sex in the past 6 months. Further, among 119 patients who had condomless sex with an HIV-positive partner and/or one whose HIV status was unknown, 98 (82%) accepted the oral HIV test.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Dental clinics may provide expanded opportunities for oral HIV rapid testing and conversations about HIV prevention in high HIV prevalence communities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erin L.

Promoter activity buffering can be encoded by sequences in both the open reading frame and 3UTR and can be implemented by both autoregulatory feedback loops and by titration of limiting trans regulators. We show experimentally that promoter activity buffering insulates cells from fitness defects due to misexpression.

Promoter activity buffering can be encoded by sequences in both the open reading frame and 3UTR and can be implemented by both autoregulatory feedback loops and by titration of limiting trans regulators. We show experimentally that promoter activity buffering insulates cells from fitness defects due to misexpression. The response of genes to changes in [TF] is encoded by sequences outside of the promoter, and this effect can either insulate or amplify the effects of aneuploidy and misregulation on organismal fitness.</description><fingerprint>858763ee</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Promoter activity buffering reduces the fitness cost of misregulation [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215186v3?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1632bc91d70:15ebbb4:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525447990640</crawled><published>1525417200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313809v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/04/313809</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313809v1?rss=1</originId><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Aguirre-Plans, J.</name></author><content><content>The traditional drug discovery paradigm has shaped around the idea of &amp;quot;one target, one disease&amp;quot;.

Pollen analysis is widely used to verify the geographic origin of honeys, but has never been employed in Australia. In this study, we analysed the pollen content of 173 unblended honey samples sourced from most of the commercial honey producing regions in southern Australia. Southern Australian vegetation is dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; (Myrtaceae) forests and, as expected, most Australian honeys are palynologically dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;, while other important components include Myrtaceae taxa such as &lt;i&gt;Corymbia&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Angophora&lt;/i&gt; and the tribe Leptospermeae; plus Brassicaceae, &lt;i&gt;Echium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Macadamia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acacia&lt;/i&gt;. An important feature of the honeys is the number of Myrtaceae pollen morphotypes per sample, which is generally high (mean = 4.6) compared to honeys produced outside of Australia, including &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys produced in the Mediterranean region, and honeys produced in South America, which has its own rich indigenous Myrtaceae flora. In the latter regions, the number of Myrtaceae morphotypes is apparently generally ≤2. A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Southern Australian vegetation is dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; (Myrtaceae) forests and, as expected, most Australian honeys are palynologically dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;, while other important components include Myrtaceae taxa such as &lt;i&gt;Corymbia&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Angophora&lt;/i&gt; and the tribe Leptospermeae; plus Brassicaceae, &lt;i&gt;Echium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Macadamia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acacia&lt;/i&gt;. An important feature of the honeys is the number of Myrtaceae pollen morphotypes per sample, which is generally high (mean = 4.6) compared to honeys produced outside of Australia, including &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys produced in the Mediterranean region, and honeys produced in South America, which has its own rich indigenous Myrtaceae flora. In the latter regions, the number of Myrtaceae morphotypes is apparently generally ≤2. A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</description><fingerprint>2af529db</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Pollen analysis of Australian honey</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_1633b7d29fd:da524e:abeb7260</id><crawled>1525711448573</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00330/20180507/images/medium/jm-2018-003309_0010.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>190</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1525665600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00330</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00330</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00330</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Daniel Ramsbeck, Antje Hamann, Georg Richter, Dagmar Schlenzig, Stefanie Geissler, Vera Nykiel, Holger Cynis, Stephan Schilling, Mirko Buchholz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00330/20180507/images/medium/jm-2018-003309_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00330&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;

As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible. Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MQif6tb7BiM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paul A.

CRISPR-Cas9 technology is routinely applied for targeted mutagenesis in model organisms and cell lines. Recent studies indicate that the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas9 system is affected by eukaryotic chromatin structures. Here, we show that the likelihood of successful mutagenesis correlates with transcript levels during early development in zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) embryos. In an experimental setting, we found that guide RNAs differ in their onset of mutagenesis activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, some guide RNAs with high &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; activity possessed poor mutagenesis activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting the presence of factors that limit the mutagenesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using open access datasets generated from early developmental stages of the zebrafish, and guide RNAs selected from the CRISPRz database, we provide further evidence for an association between gene expression during early development and the success of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish embryos. In order to further inspect the effect of chromatin on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we analysed the relationship of selected chromatin features on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency using publicly available data from zebrafish embryos. We found a correlation between chromatin openness and the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. These results indicate that CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis is influenced by chromatin accessibility in zebrafish embryos.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Meri I. E.

We propose it as a tool to bridge the gap between behavioural biology and data sciences, thus connecting computational and behavioural scientists. rethomics comes with a extensive documentation as well as a set of both practical and theoretical tutorials (available at https://rethomics.github.io).</description><fingerprint>1852ea8d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Rethomics: an R framework to analyse high-throughput behavioural data [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/305664v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1630325226e:3dd927:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1524766155374</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1524764252000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/394-b?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/394.2.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/394-b?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><fingerprint>39376ed7</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Lessons learned from the JACS Challenge</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/394-b?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506d:2835af05</id><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><updated>1525813200000</updated><published>1525813200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Mohammad Enamul Haque</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods. As exemplified by the targeted gene identification of a master regulator WRI1, which regulates fatty acid biosynthesis, we found that the improved ChIP method worked well. We analyzed percentage input and fold changes of the ChIPed DNA. We also made successful ChIP-seq libraries using this method. This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Research on familiar faces has recurrently been conducted in different domains, such as, psycholinguistics, memory, attention, face processing, aging studies, etc. In general, photographs of celebrities, their proper names, or their occupations have been the materials mainly employed in those types of studies. These stimuli are, however, very constrained by the geographic and sociocultural contexts in which the studies are conducted, and, in spite of their relevance for psychological research, there are no normative studies for celebrities in Spain. With the aim of filling this gap, the photographs and names of the 118 most frequently produced celebrities in Spain were collected. For each celebrity, values for 13 different indices (including psycholinguistic properties, naming times, and emotional indicators) were obtained from a young adult Spanish sample. Regression analyses on the data indicated that the main determinant in naming times and ToTs was the percentage of correct responses. Face agreement was also a significant predictor of ToTs. Results were compared with previous celebrity norms in other languages, and discussed in relation to the current models of face processing. These norms are likely to make a useful contribution to the design of more controlled research and applied tools in Psychology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alejandra Marful, Antonio M.

Since endophytes can affect metabolism of host plants, they are expected to be used to improve crop quality, especially for crops with organoleptic sensitive products such as wine grape. However, details of metabolic interactions between endophytes and host plants were less understood. In this work, we used high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the metabolites of fruit flesh cells of grape treated with dual culture of different endophytic fungal strains (EFS). We observed that the dual-culture with different fungal strains show different metabolites composition in grape cells. In response to different EFS, quantities of detected metabolites in grape cells varied from 6 to 17 in this assay, and 1 to 11 novel metabolites were introduced into metabolome of grape cells. Dual-culture with fungal strains CS2, RH16 and RH5 introduced the highest quantities (10 or 11) of novel metabolites in grape cells. More importantly, the modification of metabolic profiles in grape cells &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; fungal endophytes appeared to be fungal strain/genus-specificity. Overall, this work revealed that introduction of specific metabolites in host plants may be one consequence during the process of endophytes-host metabolic interactions, which raise the possibility to shape grape qualities and characteristics using tool of fungal endophytes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Li-Hua Huang, Ming-Quan Yuan, Xiu-Jin Ao, An-Yun Ren, Han-Bo Zhang, Ming-Zhi Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the nationwide seasonal peaks, risk factors, and utilization of medical resources of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;A Taiwan nationwide birth cohort was extracted from the Birth Certificate Application Database during 2007–2009 and prospectively linked to the National Health Insurance database. We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29–35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants without BPD born at &amp;lt; 32 wGA had higher RSVH rate than those born at 33–35 wGA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Overall, 56.4% of RSVH occurred within 9 months of CA. Preterm infants with BPD had significantly higher ICU admission rate within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), MV usage within 12 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and LOS within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) than those without BPD.

Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) constitutes one of the most important food fish in Japan; accordingly, genome sequencing and linkage mapping have been conducted for the purpose of artificial cultivation. In the next stage, integration of genomic sequences within linkage groups (LG) is required to construct higher-resolution genetic markers for quantitative trait loci mapping and selective breeding of beneficial traits in farming. In order to identify LG1-linked scaffolds from the draft genome assembly (323,776 scaffolds) reported previously, we attempted to isolate chromosomes corresponding to LG1 by flow sorting and subsequent analyses. Initially, single chromosomes were randomly collected by chromosome sorting and subjected to whole-genome amplification (WGA). A total of 60 WGA samples were screened by PCR with primers for a known LG1-linked scaffold, and five positive WGA samples were sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Following reference mapping analysis of the NGS reads, four of the five WGA samples were found to be enriched by LG1-linked sequences. These samples were cytogenetically assigned to chromosome 5 by fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization. Using blastn searches with 82,081 contigs constructed from the NGS reads of the four WGA samples as queries, 2323 scaffolds were identified as putative LG1-linked scaffolds from the draft genome assembly. The total length of the putative LG1-linked scaffolds was 99.0 Mb, comparable to the estimated DNA amounts of chromosome 5 (91.1 Mb). These results suggest that the methodology developed herein is applicable to isolate specific chromosome DNAs and integrate unanchored scaffold sequences onto a particular LG and chromosome even in teleost fishes, in which isolation of specific chromosomes by flow sorting is generally difficult owing to similar morphologies, sizes, and GC-contents among chromosomes in the genome. The putative LG1-linked scaffolds of Japanese eel contain a total of 6833 short tandem repeats which will be available for higher-resolution linkage mapping.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazumi Matsubara, Yuki Iwasaki, Issei Nishiki, Kazuharu Nomura, Atushi Fujiwara&lt;/p&gt;

Consumption of different PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) can induce functional changes in blood vessels via endothelial cells, which interact with dietary factors in the circulation. The basement membrane that separates the endothelium from the smooth muscle cells of the medial layer can also influence the functional state of endothelial cells. However, the effect of basement membrane on the endothelial response to dietary PUFAs in relation to growth state (e.g. proliferation versus quiescence) has never been investigated. We therefore compared the viability (CCK kit) and proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) of EA.hy926 endothelial cells grown on Matrigel or collagen versus non-coated plates. EA.hy926 viability and proliferation were also assessed after treatment with 0–150 μM of PUFAs [linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. Our study showed that only cells grown on Matrigel-coated plates reached quiescence after becoming confluent with a decreased level of MCM2 and p-cyclin D1 (T286), increased levels of p27kip1 and a low level of apoptosis and senescence. AA, EPA and DHA decreased the viability and proliferation of subconfluent cells grown on plastic dishes in a dose-dependent manner, while the presence of Matrigel made the cells resistant to these adverse effects. Confluent cell viability was less sensitive to higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA than subconfluent cells, and a significant increase in caspase-3 cleavage was only observed in confluent cells treated with DHA. Higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA suppressed DNA synthesis by both subconfluent and confluent cells, while precursor C18 PUFAs (LA and ALA) had no negative effects on viability and proliferation. Our study is the first to show that extracellular matrix and growth state are important factors in the EA.hy926 cell response to PUFAs, and that the mechanisms by which individual PUFAs operate may be growth state-dependent.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youjia Du, Carla G.

This work uncovers a virulence strategy in which the &lt;i&gt;V. dahliae&lt;/i&gt; secretory protein, VdSCP41, directly targets plant transcription factors to inhibit immunity, and reveals CBP60g, SARD1 and GhCBP60b as crucial components governing &lt;i&gt;V. dahliae&lt;/i&gt; resistance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>The plant specific transcription factors CBP60g and SARD1 are targeted by a Verticillium secretory protein VdSCP41 to modulate immunity</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34902</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162f8a5b82f:6a6329b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1524590032943</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1524585994000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4465.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4465</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4465.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jessica A.

To date, the RV144 HIV vaccine trial has been the only study to show that immunization can confer protection from HIV infection. While encouraging, the modest 31.2% (P = 0.04) efficacy achieved in this study left significant room for improvement, and created an incentive to optimize the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine immunogens to increase the level of vaccine efficacy. Since the completion of the RV144 trial, our understanding of the antigenic structure of the HIV envelope protein, gp120, and of the specificity of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that bind to it, has significantly improved. In particular, we have learned that multiple families of bN-mAbs require specific oligomannose glycans for binding. Both of the monomeric gp120 immunogens (MN- and A244-rgp120) in the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine used in the RV144 trial were enriched for glycans containing high levels of sialic acid, and lacked critical N-linked glycosylation sites required for binding by several families of bN-mAbs. The absence of these epitopes may have contributed to the low level of efficacy achieved in this study. In this report, we describe our efforts to improve the antigenic structure of the rgp120 immunogens used in the vaccine by optimizing glycan-dependent epitopes recognized by multiple bN-mAbs. Our results demonstrated that by shifting the location of one PNGS in A244-rgp120, and by adding two PNGS to MN-rgp120, in conjunction with the production of both proteins in a cell line that favors the incorporation of oligomannose glycans, we could significantly improve the binding by three major families of bN-mAbs. The immunogens described here represent a second generation of gp120-based vaccine immunogens that exhibit potential for use in RV144 follow-up studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rachel C.

The immunogens described here represent a second generation of gp120-based vaccine immunogens that exhibit potential for use in RV144 follow-up studies.</description><fingerprint>d05a1ba6</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Glycan modifications to the gp120 immunogens used in the RV144 vaccine trial improve binding to broadly neutralizing antibodies</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196370</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e5c:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><updated>1525122000000</updated><published>1525122000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196663</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196663</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196663</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ana Belén Sánchez-García</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Belén Sánchez-García, Sergio Ibáñez, Antonio Cano, Manuel Acosta, José Manuel Pérez-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;
Understanding the functional basis of auxin homeostasis requires knowledge about auxin biosynthesis, auxin transport and auxin catabolism genes, which is not always directly available despite the recent whole-genome sequencing of many plant species. Through sequence homology searches and phylogenetic analyses on a selection of 11 plant species with high-quality genome annotation, we identified the putative gene homologs involved in auxin biosynthesis, auxin catabolism and auxin transport pathways in carnation (&lt;i&gt;Dianthus caryophyllus&lt;/i&gt; L.). To deepen our knowledge of the regulatory events underlying auxin-mediated adventitious root formation in carnation stem cuttings, we used RNA-sequencing data to confirm the expression profiles of some auxin homeostasis genes during the rooting of two carnation cultivars with different rooting behaviors. We also confirmed the presence of several auxin-related metabolites in the stem cutting tissues. Our findings offer a comprehensive overview of auxin homeostasis genes in carnation and provide a solid foundation for further experiments investigating the role of auxin homeostasis in the regulation of adventitious root formation in carnation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Belén Sánchez-García, Sergio Ibáñez, Antonio Cano, Manuel Acosta, José Manuel Pérez-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

The thalamus, a crucial regulator of cortical functions, is composed of many nuclei arranged in a spatially complex pattern. Thalamic neurogenesis occurs over a short period during mammalian embryonic development. These features have hampered the effort to understand how regionalization, cell divisions, and fate specification are coordinated and produce a wide array of nuclei that exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression and functions. Here, we performed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; clonal analysis to track the divisions of individual progenitor cells and spatial allocation of their progeny in the developing mouse thalamus. Quantitative analysis of clone compositions revealed evidence for sequential generation of distinct sets of thalamic nuclei based on the location of the founder progenitor cells. Furthermore, we identified intermediate progenitor cells that produced neurons populating more than one thalamic nuclei, indicating a prolonged specification of nuclear fate. Our study reveals an organizational principle that governs the spatial and temporal progression of cell divisions and fate specification and provides a framework for studying cellular heterogeneity and connectivity in the mammalian thalamus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bh5Rbs1VtLg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Z.

Jasmonates (JAs) are signalling molecules involved in stress responses, development and secondary metabolism biosynthesis, although their roles in fleshy-fruit development and ripening processes are not well known. In strawberry fruit, it has been proposed that JAs could regulate the early development through the activation of the JAs biosynthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that JA treatment increases anthocyanin content in strawberry fruit involving the bioactive jasmonate biosynthesis. Nevertheless, JA signalling pathway, of which main components are the COI1-JAZ co-receptor and the MYC transcription factors (TFs), has not been characterized in strawberry until now. Here we identified and characterized the woodland strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;) JAZ and MYC genes as well as studied their expression during development and ripening stages in commercial strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;) fruit. We described twelve putative JAZ proteins and two MYC TFs, which showed high conservation with respect to their orthologs in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and in other fleshy-fruit species such as &lt;i&gt;Malus&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;domestica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by gene synteny and phylogenetic analyses. Noteworthy, their expression levels exhibited a significant decrease from fruit development to ripening stages in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;, along with others of the JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaNINJA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FaJAM&lt;/i&gt;s, encoding for negative regulators of JA responses. Moreover, we found that main JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaMYC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;FaJAZ1&lt;/i&gt; are promptly induced by JA treatment at early times in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. These results suggest the conservation of the canonical JA signalling pathway in strawberry and a possible role of this pathway in early strawberry fruit development, which also correlates negatively with the beginning of the ripening process.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adrián Garrido-Bigotes, Nicolás E.

Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds with variable phenolic structures, have been found to possess anti-cancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors like CDK6. To understand the binding behavior of flavonoids that inhibit the active CDK6, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on six inhibitors, chrysin (M01), fisetin (M03), galangin (M04), genistein (M05), quercetin (M06) and kaempferol (M07), complexed with CDK6/cyclin D. For all six flavonoids, the 3’-OH and 4’-OH of B-ring were found to be favorable for hydrogen bond formation, but the 3-OH on the C-ring and 5-OH on the A-ring were unfavorable, which were confirmed by the MD simulation results of the test molecule, 3’, 4’, 7-trihydroxyflavone (M15). The binding efficiencies of flavonoids against the CDK6/cyclin D complex were mainly through the electrostatic (especially the H-bond force) and vdW interactions with residues ILE19, VAL27, ALA41, GLU61, PHE98, GLN103, ASP163 and LEU152. The order of binding affinities of these flavonoids toward the CDK6/cyclin D was M03 &gt; M01 &gt; M07 &gt; M15 &gt; M06 &gt; M05 &gt; M04. It is anticipated that the binding features of flavonoid inhibitors studied in the present work may provide valuable insights for the development of CDK6 inhibitors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jingxiao Zhang, Lilei Zhang, Yangcheng Xu, Shanshan Jiang, Yueyue Shao&lt;/p&gt;

We show that it successfully performs image segmentation tasks on samples with substantial defects and even generalizes well to different tissue types.</description><fingerprint>f7e8fbe5</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Automated Segmentation of Epithelial Tissue Using Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/311373v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1638e560252:795eca9:2835af05</id><crawled>1527101391442</crawled><published>1527058800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282269v3?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/282269</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282269v3?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Crook, O.

Sexual transmission is the principal driver of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. Understanding HIV vaccine-induced immune responses at mucosal surfaces can generate hypotheses regarding mechanisms of protection, and may influence vaccine development. The RV144 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00223080) efficacy trial showed protection against HIV infections but mucosal samples were not collected, therefore, the contribution of mucosal antibodies to preventing HIV-1 acquisition is unknown. Here, we report the generation, magnitude and persistence of antibody responses to recombinant gp120 envelope and antigens including variable one and two loop scaffold antigens (gp70V1V2) previously shown to correlate with risk in RV144. We evaluated antibody responses to gp120 A244gD and gp70V1V2 92TH023 (both CRF01_AE) and Case A2 (subtype B) in cervico-vaginal mucus (CVM), seminal plasma (SP) and rectal secretions (RS) from HIV-uninfected RV144 vaccine recipients, who were randomized to receive two late boosts of ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E, AIDSVAX®B/E, or ALVAC-HIV alone at 0 and 6 months. Late vaccine boosting increased IgG geometric mean titers (GMT) to gp120 A244gD in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (28 and 17 fold, respectively), followed by SP and RS. IgG to gp70V1V2 92TH023 increased in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (11–17 fold) and SP (2 fold) two weeks post first boost. IgG to Case A2 was only detected in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM. Mucosal IgG to gp120 A244gD (CVM, SP, RS), gp70V1V2 92TH023 (CVM, SP), and Case A2 (CVM) correlated with plasma IgG levels (p&amp;lt;0.001). Although the magnitude of IgG responses declined after boosting, anti-gp120 A244gD IgG responses in CVM persisted for 12 months post final vaccination.

Testudinid herpesviruses (TeHVs) have a worldwide distribution among tortoises. However, information such as risk factors promoting the occurrence or the recrudescence of the associated disease and the mid-term sequelae of an outbreak comprising the extent and dynamic of the viral shedding have been only minimally investigated. Critical management information is also lacking or anecdotal. Furthermore, major aspects of the viral pathogenesis including the likelihood of vertical transmission of the virus are virtually unknown. The present study describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of &lt;i&gt;Testudinid herpesvirus&lt;/i&gt; genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of chelonians. Clinical, pathological, molecular and serological characterization of the outbreak were carried out. Seventy-five percent of the infected tortoises died. Complementation of molecular and serological testing was a critical point for successful management implementations. A case-control study was performed to analyze possible risk factors associated with the infection. Furthermore, a subgroup of six asymptomatic infected tortoises was monitored for two consecutive seasons after the outbreak: all the infected tortoises were determined to be intermittent shedders, except one, which was a persistent shedder. Post-hibernation was associated with the highest number of shedders. Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus was obtained for the first time.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Luisa Marenzoni, Lorenzo Santoni, Andrea Felici, Carmen Maresca, Valentina Stefanetti, Monica Sforna, Maria Pia Franciosini, Patrizia Casagrande Proietti, Francesco Carlo Origgi&lt;/p&gt;

The present study describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of &lt;i&gt;Testudinid herpesvirus&lt;/i&gt; genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of chelonians. Clinical, pathological, molecular and serological characterization of the outbreak were carried out. Seventy-five percent of the infected tortoises died. Complementation of molecular and serological testing was a critical point for successful management implementations. A case-control study was performed to analyze possible risk factors associated with the infection. Furthermore, a subgroup of six asymptomatic infected tortoises was monitored for two consecutive seasons after the outbreak: all the infected tortoises were determined to be intermittent shedders, except one, which was a persistent shedder. Post-hibernation was associated with the highest number of shedders. Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus was obtained for the first time.</description><fingerprint>d9a2aea0</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Clinical, virological and epidemiological characterization of an outbreak of Testudinid Herpesvirus 3 in a chelonian captive breeding facility: Lessons learned and first evidence of TeHV3 vertical transmission</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197169</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162fe05c2e1:609d80:91749e5b</id><crawled>1524680213217</crawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04972-x/d41586-018-04972-x_15717358.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><published>1524639600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04972-x</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04972-x</originId><engagement>1314</engagement><author><name>Elizabeth Gibney</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Universe&apos;s first moments mimicked with ultracool atoms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universe&apos;s first moments mimicked with ultracool atoms, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04972-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04972-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Physicists see the hallmarks of cosmic expansion in a ring of cold atoms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Universe&apos;s first moments mimicked with ultracool atoms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universe&apos;s first moments mimicked with ultracool atoms, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04972-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04972-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Physicists see the hallmarks of cosmic expansion in a ring of cold atoms.</description><fingerprint>d790f8a3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Universe&apos;s first moments mimicked with ultracool atoms</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04972-x</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1631b9cebb8:247a1de:4e164c41</id><crawled>1525176658872</crawled><published>1525132800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31922</link><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31922</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31922</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>yanik@ethz.ch (Mehmet Fatih Yanik)</name></author><description>Identification of optimal transcription-factor expression patterns to direct cellular differentiation along a desired pathway presents significant challenges.

The various quantitative criteria obtained from segmented images can uncover various unknown mechanisms of embryonic development, such as the robust mechanism of development.</description><fingerprint>e722e9b3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Development of Convolutional Neural Network Based Instance Segmentation Algorithm to Acquire Quantitative Criteria of Mouse Development [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324186v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16343fc73f1:966c92:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525854008305</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1525849200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25538-x</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25538-x</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25538-x</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Maryam Majidian</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Role of the particle size polydispersity in the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube-epoxy composites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Role of the particle size polydispersity in the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube-epoxy composites, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25538-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25538-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Role of the particle size polydispersity in the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube-epoxy composites&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/eIDlX9lsb_U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Role of the particle size polydispersity in the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube-epoxy composites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Role of the particle size polydispersity in the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube-epoxy composites, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25538-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25538-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Role of the particle size polydispersity in the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube-epoxy composites&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/eIDlX9lsb_U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>d68527e7</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Author Correction: Role of the particle size polydispersity in the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube-epoxy composites</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/eIDlX9lsb_U/s41598-018-25538-x</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_1636fc1be8d:58a7:d63e3ae2</id><crawled>1526588358285</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00262/20180517/images/medium/cb-2018-00262w_0005.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>144</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1526529600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00262</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00262</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00262</originId><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Kim Nguyen, Mahima B.

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and patient-level genetic assessments can guide therapy choice and impact prognosis. However, little is known about the impact of genetic variability within a tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), on disease progression or outcome. Current approaches using bulk tumor specimens can suggest the presence of ITH, but only single-cell genetic methods have the resolution to describe the underlying clonal structures themselves. Current techniques tend to be labor and resource intensive and challenging to characterize with respect to sources of biological and technical variability. We have developed a platform using a microfluidic self-digitization chip to partition cells in stationary volumes for cell imaging and allele-specific PCR. Genotyping data from only confirmed single-cell volumes is obtained and subject to a variety of relevant quality control assessments such as allele dropout, false positive, and false negative rates. We demonstrate single-cell genotyping of the &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt; type A mutation, an important prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukemia, on single cells of the cell line OCI-AML3, describing a more complex zygosity distribution than would be predicted via bulk analysis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alison M.

The psychometric properties of the ten-item Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K10) have been extensively explored in civilian populations. However, documentation of its psychometric properties in military populations is limited, and there is no universally accepted cut-off score on the K10 to distinguish clinical vs. sub-clinical levels of distress. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the K10 in Canadian Armed Forces personnel. Data on 6700 Regular Forces personnel were obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey. The internal consistency and factor structure of the K10 (range, 0–40) were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to select optimal cut-offs for the K10, using the presence/absence of any of four past-month disorders as the outcome (posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). Cronbach’s alpha (0.88) indicated a high level of internal consistency of the K10. Results from CFA indicated that a single-factor 10-item construct had an acceptable overall fit: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05; 90% confidence interval (CI):0.05–0.06, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.99, weighted root mean square residual (WRMR) = 2.06. K10 scores were strongly associated with both the presence and recency of all four measured disorders. The area under the ROC curve was 0.92, demonstrating excellent predictive value for past-30-day disorders. A K10 score of 10 or greater was optimal for screening purposes (sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 83%), while a score of 17 or greater (sensitivity = 53%; specificity = 97%) was optimal for prevalence estimation of clinically significant psychological distress, in that it resulted in equal numbers of false positives and false negatives. Our results suggest that K10 scale has satisfactory psychometric properties for use as a measure of non-specific psychological distress in the military population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hugues Sampasa-Kanyinga, Mark A.

Urban economies are composed of diverse activities, embodied in labor occupations, which depend on one another to produce goods and services. Yet little is known about how the nature and intensity of these interdependences change as cities increase in population size and economic complexity. Understanding the relationship between occupational interdependencies and the number of occupations defining an urban economy is relevant because interdependence within a networked system has implications for system resilience and for how easily can the structure of the network be modified. Here, we represent the interdependencies among occupations in a city as a non-spatial information network, where the strengths of interdependence between pairs of occupations determine the strengths of the links in the network. Using those quantified link strengths we calculate a single metric of interdependence–or connectedness–which is equivalent to the density of a city’s weighted occupational network. We then examine urban systems in six industrialized countries, analyzing how the density of urban occupational networks changes with network size, measured as the number of unique occupations present in an urban workforce. We find that in all six countries, density, or economic interdependence, increases superlinearly with the number of distinct occupations. Because connections among occupations represent flows of information, we provide evidence that connectivity scales superlinearly with network size in information networks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shade T.

Understanding complexity in physical, biological, social and information systems is predicated on describing interactions amongst different components. Advances in genomics are facilitating the high-throughput identification of molecular interactions, and graphs are emerging as indispensable tools in explaining how the connections in the network drive organismal phenotypic plasticity. Here, we describe the architectural organization and associated emergent topological properties of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that describe protein-DNA interactions (PDIs) in several model eukaryotes. By analyzing GRN connectivity, our results show that the anticipated scale-free network architectures are characterized by organism-specific power law scaling exponents. These exponents are independent of the fraction of the GRN experimentally sampled, enabling prediction of properties of the complete GRN for an organism. We further demonstrate that the exponents describe inequalities in transcription factor (TF)-target gene recognition across GRNs. These observations have the important biological implication that they predict the existence of an intrinsic organism-specific &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; regulatory landscape that constrains GRN topologies. Consequently, architectural GRN organization drives not only phenotypic plasticity within a species, but is also likely implicated in species-specific phenotype.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6xXxhGM4T7U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wilberforce Zachary Ouma, Katja Pogacar, Erich Grotewold&lt;/p&gt;

Consequently, architectural GRN organization drives not only phenotypic plasticity within a species, but is also likely implicated in species-specific phenotype.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6xXxhGM4T7U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>7f7b107c</fingerprint><recrawled>1525110130225</recrawled><unread>True</unread><title>Topological and statistical analyses of gene regulatory networks reveal unifying yet quantitatively different emergent properties</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/6xXxhGM4T7U/article</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162fc1023bf:276531:91749e5b</id><crawled>1524647338943</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24908-9/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24908_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><published>1524639600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24908-9</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24908-9</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24908-9</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Sonja Johannsmeier</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold nanoparticle-mediated laser stimulation induces a complex stress response in neuronal cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold nanoparticle-mediated laser stimulation induces a complex stress response in neuronal cells, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24908-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24908-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Gold nanoparticle-mediated laser stimulation induces a complex stress response in neuronal cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/i3PQa6NXJyc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold nanoparticle-mediated laser stimulation induces a complex stress response in neuronal cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold nanoparticle-mediated laser stimulation induces a complex stress response in neuronal cells, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24908-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24908-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Gold nanoparticle-mediated laser stimulation induces a complex stress response in neuronal cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/i3PQa6NXJyc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>92893748</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Gold nanoparticle-mediated laser stimulation induces a complex stress response in neuronal cells</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/i3PQa6NXJyc/s41598-018-24908-9</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636a56ccdf:4381133:93d646dc</id><crawled>1526497463519</crawled><published>1526454000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318295v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/16/318295</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318295v1?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Gronbech, C.

The 2009 influenza pandemic, the variant H3N2v viruses in agricultural fairs and the zoonotic poultry H5N9 infections in China have highlighted the constant threat that influenza A viruses (IAV) present to people and animals. In this study we evaluated the effect of IAV vaccination on aerosol shedding in pigs housed in warm environmental conditions. Thirty-six, three-week old weaned pigs were obtained from an IAV negative herd and were randomly allocated to one of 4 groups: 1) a homologous vaccine group, 2) a heterologous multivalent vaccine group, 3) a heterologous monovalent group and, 4) a non-vaccinated group. After vaccination pigs were challenged with the triple reassortant A/Sw/IA/00239/04 H1N1 virus. Environmental temperature and relative humidity were recorded throughout the study. Nasal swabs, oral fluids and air samples were collected daily. All samples were tested by RRT-PCR and virus isolation was attempted on positive samples. Average temperature and relative humidity throughout the study were 27°C (80°F) and 53%, respectively. A significantly higher proportion of infected pigs was detected in the non-vaccinated than in the vaccinated group. Lower levels of nasal virus shedding were found in vaccinated groups compared to non-vaccinated group and IAV was not detected in air samples of any of the vaccinated groups. In contrast, positive air samples were detected in the non-vaccinated group at 1, 2 and 3 days post infection although the overall levels were considered low most likely due to the elevated environmental temperature. In conclusion, both the decrease in shedding and the increase in environmental temperature may have contributed to the inability to detect airborne IAV in vaccinated pigs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Victor Neira, Matt Allerson, Cesar Corzo, Marie Culhane, Aaron Rendahl, Montserrat Torremorell&lt;/p&gt;

We need all the reality checks we can get, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/423&quot;&gt;and this one&lt;/a&gt; (reported by a large multinational team led out of Oxford) uses light scattering to get more mass resolution than I would have thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light scattering by small particles depends on their refractive index and the particle volume. Proteins have basically the same refractive index (the indices of the individual amino acids don’t vary that much, and it’s all averaged out). Likewise, the volume occupied by each amino acid is very similar as well, and putting these together means that if you do very accurate light scattering measurements (using interferometry) the signal you get should be proportional to the number of amino acid residues or the total mass. This effect has been predicted, but recent improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to actually observe this and use it in real applications. The group gives the technique the deliberately memorable name of iSCAMS (interferometric scattering mass spectrometry), and we’ll have to get used to the idea of being able to do “mass spec” with a microscope and visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over a range of proteins (both monomers and larger oligomers), the team found a very good correlation (within 1.8%, plus or minus half a per cent) between the interferomic signature and protein mass, one that (importantly) was not influenced by the three-dimensional shape of the protein itself. The correlation also held for lipid nanodisc species, which is a good sign. And since I was writing just the other day about glycosylated proteins, I note that they also observed various states of a highly glycosylated (up to half the molecular weight) HIV envelope complex, and could spot the differences there as well. So it look like the effect holds for a number of different biomolecule types, although I expect that there will be refinements to the scattering models for these as the technique is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like it could be a very good technique for studying protein-protein interactions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the potential advantage of spatial resolution as well. I’m not sure if you could ever get something like this to work in a living cell (the signal/noise would be a huge problem), but there’s a lot of biomolecular behavior that you could get new details on short of that. There are a lot of variations to try, such as different surfaces, and immobilized binding partners. This could be a good complement to techniques like SPR, only this time at a single-protein level. It’ll be interesting to see if it can get to the point of delivering on- and off-rates, which is one of SPR’s great advantages. As it stands now, the resolution of iSCAMS doesn’t seem good enough to detect small-molecule binding to individual proteins, but it could certainly pick up small molecule effects on protein complexes, and presumably effects on protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-polysaccharide interactions as well. That should keep everyone occupied!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>I’m always happy when a new analytical technique is worked out, especially one that’s applicable to biological binding assays, doesn’t require labeling of the species involved, and is orthogonal to the existing methods.

Huntington’s disease (HD) age of onset (AO) is mainly determined by the length of the CAG repeat expansion in the &lt;i&gt;huntingtin&lt;/i&gt; gene. The remaining AO variability has been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the REGISTRY project of the European Huntington’s Disease Network. Multiple linear regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor symptoms 5–8 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp range (40–44). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable. However, given that most pre-HD AHT patients included in our study had started treatment with antihypertensive drugs prior to the onset of HD, and that antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to confer a neuroprotective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases, raises the interest in elucidating the impact of AHT and/or AHT treatment in HD age of onset in further studies. A confirmation of our results in a larger sample set would open the possibility to significantly improve HD management.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leire Valcárcel-Ocete, Asier Fullaondo, Gorka Alkorta-Aranburu, María García-Barcina, Raymund A.

Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites. At baseline, less than half the facilities in Johannesburg and Mopani had dedicated eye care personnel or sufficient space to measure visual acuity. Although visual acuity charts were available in most facilities, &amp;lt;50% assessed patients at the correct distance. Median score for availability of nine essential drugs was &amp;lt;70%. Referral criteria knowledge was highest in Cape Winelands and Johannesburg, with poor clinical knowledge across all districts. Several HSS interventions produced successful outcomes: compared to control sites there was a significant increase in the proportion of intervention sites with eye care personnel and resources such as visual acuity charts (p = 0.02 and &amp;lt;0.01, respectively). However, engaging with district pharmacists did not improve availability of essential drugs (p = 0.47). Referral criteria knowledge improved significantly in intervention sites (p&amp;lt;0.01) but there was no improvement in clinical knowledge (p = 0.76). Primary eye care in South Africa faces multiple challenges with regard to organisation of care, resource availability and clinical competence. The HSS package successfully improved some aspects of this care, but further development is warranted together with debate regarding the positioning of eye services at PHC level.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rivka R.

We have developed our original tissue engineering technology “cell sheet engineering” utilizing temperature-responsive culture dishes. The cells are confluently grown on a temperature-responsive culture dish and can be harvested as a cell sheet by lowering temperature without enzymatic digestion. Cell sheets are high-cell-density tissues similar to actual living tissues, maintaining their structure and function. Based on this “cell sheet engineering”, we are trying to create functional cardiac tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells, for regenerative therapy and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing. Toward this purpose, it is necessary to evaluate the contractility of engineered cardiac cell sheets. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a contractile force measurement system and evaluated the contractility of human iPSC-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissues. By attaching the cardiac cell sheets on fibrin gel sheets, we created dynamically beating cardiac cell sheet-tissues. They were mounted to the force measurement system and the contractile force was measured stably and clearly. The absolute values of contractile force were around 1 mN, and the mean force value per cross-sectional area was 3.3 mN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are equivalent to or larger than many previously reported values, indicating the functionality of our engineered cardiac cell sheets. We also confirmed that both the contractile force and beating rate were significantly increased by the administration of adrenaline, which are the physiologically relevant responses for cardiac tissues. In conclusion, the force measurement system developed in the present study is valuable for the evaluation of engineered cardiac cell sheet-tissues, and for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing as well.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daisuke Sasaki, Katsuhisa Matsuura, Hiroyoshi Seta, Yuji Haraguchi, Teruo Okano, Tatsuya Shimizu&lt;/p&gt;

In conclusion, the force measurement system developed in the present study is valuable for the evaluation of engineered cardiac cell sheet-tissues, and for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing as well.</description><fingerprint>c05af95</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Contractile force measurement of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissue</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198026</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16326562744:d15084:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525356570436</crawled><published>1525305600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Synthesis_of_1_2_5_6-_and_1_4_5_8-Anthracenetetrone_Building_Blocks_for_-Conjugated_Small_Molecules_and_Polymers/6213701</link><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Synthesis_of_1_2_5_6-_and_1_4_5_8-Anthracenetetrone_Building_Blocks_for_-Conjugated_Small_Molecules_and_Polymers/6213701</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Reliable

Prepartum supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) may influence lipolysis and hyperketonemia in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of prepartum CLA supplementation on lactation performance and serum fatty acids (FA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in early lactation dairy cows, and secondarily on reproductive performance. Multiparous cows were enrolled in the study at 18 days prior to expected calving date, and randomly assigned 100 g/day of Lutrell Pure (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; 75% FA), providing 10 g/day of each CLA isomer (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-10 &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-12 and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-9 &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-11 CLA) or equivalent amount of rumen inert fatty acids as control (78 g/day of Energy Booster 100; Milk Specialties Global, Eden Prairie, MN). Treatments were top dressed daily to individual cows from enrollment to calving and all cows were offered the same ration. Blood samples were collected on the first day of supplementation, 10 days prepartum, and 1, 7, 14, and 30 days postpartum. Hyperketonemia was defined as serum BHB ≥ 1.2 mM. Milk yield was recorded daily until 60 days postpartum and averaged weekly. Milk samples were obtained weekly for component analysis. Prepartum CLA supplementation tended to increase serum concentration of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and increased trans-10, cis-12 CLA prepartum. Cows supplemented with CLA had increased milk protein yield and tended to have increased milk fat yield and milk yield, which together resulted in greater energy content of milk. Cows supplemented with CLA had lower serum FA on day 1 and 7 postpartum and overall lower serum BHB postpartum, which resulted in decreased prevalence of hyperketonemia on day 14 postpartum. There were no differences in body condition score change, other health disorders, or reproductive outcomes by treatment. Together, these findings indicate that prepartum CLA supplementation may be a plausible strategy to positively influence postpartum performance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Caputo Oliveira, Ryan S.

The bionematicidal effect of a synthetic volatile mixture (SVM) of four volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the endophytic fungus &lt;i&gt;Daldinia cf&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;concentrica&lt;/i&gt; against the devastating plant-parasitic root-knot nematode &lt;i&gt;Meloidogyne javanica&lt;/i&gt; has been recently demonstrated in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and greenhouse experiments. However, the mode of action governing the observed irreversible paralysis of J2 larvae upon exposure to SVM is unknown. To unravel the mechanism underlying the anthelmintic and nematicidal activities, we used the tractable model worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; was also susceptible to both the fungal VOCs and SVM. Among compounds comprising SVM, 3-methyl-1-butanol, (±)-2-methyl-1-butanol, and 4-heptanone showed significant nematicidal activity toward L1, L4 and young adult stages. Egg hatching was only negatively affected by 4-heptanone. To determine the mechanism underlying this activity, we examined the response of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; mutants for glutamate-gated chloride channel and acetylcholine transporter, targets of the nematicidal drugs ivermectin and aldicarb, respectively, to 4-heptanone and SVM. These aldicarb- and ivermectin-resistant mutants retained susceptibility upon exposure to 4-heptanone and SVM. Next, we used &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; TJ356 strain &lt;i&gt;zIs356 (daf-16&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, LD1 &lt;i&gt;ldIs7&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;skn-1B/C&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP + pRF4&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;rol-6&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;su1006&lt;/i&gt;))], LD1171 &lt;i&gt;ldIs3 [gcs-1p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;gfp; rol-6(su1006))]&lt;/i&gt;, CL2166 &lt;i&gt;dvIs19 (gst-4p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP)&lt;/i&gt; and CF1553 &lt;i&gt;muIs84 (sod-3p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, which have mutations in genes regulating multiple stress responses. Following exposure of L4 larvae to 4-heptanone or SVM, there was clear nuclear translocation of DAF-16::GFP, and SKN-1::GFP indicating that their susceptibility involves DAF-16 and SKN1 regulation. Application of 4-heptanone, but not SVM, induced increased expression of, &lt;i&gt;gcs-1&lt;/i&gt;::GFP and &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt;::GFP compared to controls. In contrast, application of 4-heptanone or SVM to the &lt;i&gt;sod-3&lt;/i&gt;::GFP line elicited a significant decline in overall fluorescence intensity compared to controls, indicating SOD-3 downregulation and therefore overall reduction in cellular redox machinery.

Background &lt;p&gt;Preclinical breast cancer models recapitulating the clinical course of metastatic disease are crucial for drug development. Highly metastatic cell lines forming spontaneous metastasis following orthotopic implantation were previously developed and characterized regarding their biological and histological characteristics. This study aimed to non-invasively and longitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formation and progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14–16 days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity of primary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT and fluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agent administration.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10 days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice, predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake.

Background &lt;p&gt;Preclinical breast cancer models recapitulating the clinical course of metastatic disease are crucial for drug development. Highly metastatic cell lines forming spontaneous metastasis following orthotopic implantation were previously developed and characterized regarding their biological and histological characteristics. This study aimed to non-invasively and longitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formation and progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14–16 days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity of primary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT and fluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agent administration.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10 days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice, predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake. Lung metastases were detected as the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake increased significantly between pre- and post-metastasis scan. Using a liposomal dual-modality agent, CT and fluorescence confirmed BLI detected lesions and identified additional metastatic nodules in the intraperitoneal cavity and lung.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of complementary anatomical and functional imaging techniques can provide high sensitivity characterization of metastatic disease spread, progression and overall disease burden. The described models and imaging toolset can be implemented as an effective means for quantitative treatment response evaluation in metastatic breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>21f6e47a</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Spatiotemporal assessment of spontaneous metastasis formation using multimodal &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; imaging in HER2&amp;lt;sup&gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; and triple negative metastatic breast cancer xenograft models in mice</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196892</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635157c215:1f2da93:93d646dc</id><crawled>1526078095893</crawled><published>1526022000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/11/319731</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Stoney, R.

Attempts to reduce this redundancy have focused on visualizing pathway overlap or merging pathways, but the resulting pathways may be of heterogeneous sizes and cover multiple biological functions.

The proposed approach considers three objectives: removal of pathway redundancy, controlling pathway size and coverage of the gene set. By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100% of the genes in the original data set with 74% less redundancy, or 95% of the genes with 88% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place. Conclusion: Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised. Pathways are not altered from their original form, allowing biological knowledge regarding the data set to be directly applicable.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient required for proper structure and function of many proteins. Bacteria regularly encounter zinc depletion and have evolved diverse mechanisms to continue growth when zinc is limited, including the expression of zinc-independent paralogs of zinc-binding proteins. Mycobacteria have a conserved operon encoding four zinc-independent alternative ribosomal proteins (AltRPs) that are expressed when zinc is depleted. It is unknown if mycobacterial AltRPs replace their primary paralogs in the ribosome and maintain protein synthesis under zinc-limited conditions, and if such replacements contribute to their physiology. This study shows that AltRPs from &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; are essential for growth when zinc ion is scarce. Specifically, the deletion mutant of this operon (Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt;) is unable to grow in media containing a high-affinity zinc chelator, while growth of the wild type strain is unaffected under the same conditions. However, when zinc is gradually depleted during growth in zinc-limited medium, the Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; mutant maintains the same growth rate as seen for the wild type strain. In contrast to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; grown with sufficient zinc supplementation that forms shorter cells when transitioning from logarithmic to stationary phase, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; deficient for zinc elongates after the expression of AltRPs in late logarithmic phase. These zinc-depleted bacteria also exhibit a remarkable morphology characterized by a condensed chromosome, increased number of polyphosphate granules, and distinct appearance of lipid bodies and the cell wall compared to the zinc-replete cells. However, the Δ&lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; cells fail to elongate and transition into the zinc-limited morphotype, resembling the wild type zinc-replete bacteria instead. Therefore, the &lt;i&gt;altRP&lt;/i&gt; operon in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; has a vital role in continuation of growth when zinc is scarce and in triggering specific morphogenesis during the adaptation to zinc limitation, suggesting that AltRPs can functionally replace their zinc-dependent paralogs, but also contribute to mycobacterial physiology in a unique way.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allexa Dow, Sladjana Prisic&lt;/p&gt;

Our methodology extends the scope of haploid genetic screens by enabling the identification of regulatory elements that control gene expression.</description><fingerprint>415d8e03</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Discovery of gene regulatory elements through a new bioinformatics analysis of haploid genetic screens [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327775v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1634b2fd2d5:1526271:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525974815445</crawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05137-6/d41586-018-05137-6_15749214.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><published>1525935600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</originId><engagement>51</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05137-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Microbes weaken host’s immune response by triggering pain neurons.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05137-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Microbes weaken host’s immune response by triggering pain neurons.</description><fingerprint>9c388810</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a1c04be:41f7c58:3dd877af</id><crawled>1526493611198</crawled><updated>1526504400000</updated><published>1526504400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197457</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197457</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197457</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Zeeshan Akhtar</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zeeshan Akhtar, Pukhraj Rishi, Ramasubramanian Srikanth, Ekta Rishi, Muna Bhende, Rajiv Raman&lt;/p&gt;
Aim &lt;p&gt;To determine choroidal thickness in healthy Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study; healthy Indian subjects (n = 230) with no history of ocular and/or systemic disorders were enrolled in the study. Choroidal thickness was measured for 230 eyes using SS-OCT. Subjects were divided into six age groups. Main outcome measures were subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular choroidal thickness (MCT) up to 3 mm at 500-micron interval from the fovea was measured in eight different quadrants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean SFCT was 307±79 μm and mean MCT was 285±75 μm. No difference in the choroidal thickness was found among genders. Mean SFCT of the different age groups was 327±68 μm (12–18 years), 364±70 μm (18.1–30 years), 321±78 μm (30.1–40 years), 304±79 μm (40.1–50 years), 283±69 μm (50.1–60 years) and 262±72μm (above 60 years; p &amp;lt;0.001; One way ANOVA). Mean macular choroidal thickness was 305±60 μm, 342±61 μm, 306±72 μm, 282±79 μm, 261±66 μm, 238±68μm respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001; one way ANOVA). A significant weak negative correlation was found between age with SFCT (r = -0.368, p&amp;lt;0.001) and MCT (r = -0.40, p&amp;lt;0.001). No significant correlation was found with refractive error, axial length and ocular perfusion pressure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that mean SFCT and MCT was 307±79μm and 285±75 μm, respectively, among healthy Indian subjects.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is one of the most common chronic metabolic diseases, but detection and treatment rates are low. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the correlation between frontal skull Hounsfield unit (HU) values from brain computed tomography (CT) scans and T-scores of the lumbar spine and femoral neck from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients with &amp;lt; 1 year between brain CT and DXA scans were included in the study. The average frontal skull HU value used for analysis was defined as the average of four HU values of the frontal bone. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated, and area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the HU values of the frontal skull for predicting osteoporosis. The frontal skull HU value with the highest sensitivity and specificity was considered the optimal cutoff value.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 899 patients who underwent both brain CT and DXA scans at a single institution were enrolled. Average skull HU values differed significantly among patients in different bone mineral density categories (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). There was a positive correlation between skull HU value and T-score (β = 105.06, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.343). The mean HU value in subjects with osteoporosis was 515, and the optimal cutoff value for the prediction of osteoporosis was 610 HU (AUC = 0.775, 95% CI 0.744–0.806, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Clinical brain CT scans can assist in the detection of osteoporosis, and patients with an HU value &amp;lt; 610 as determined via brain CT may be considered for further evaluation for possible osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Min Kyun Na, Yu Deok Won, Choong Hyun Kim, Jae Min Kim, Jin Hwan Cheong, Je Il Ryu, Myung-Hoon Han&lt;/p&gt;

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a zinc-dependent protease associated with early immune responses to &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection, macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation. We evaluated whether adjunctive inhibition of MMP-9 could improve the response to standard TB treatment in a mouse model that develops necrotic lesions. Six weeks after an aerosol infection with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, C3HeB/FeJ mice received standard TB treatment (12 weeks) comprising rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide alone or in combination with either anti-MMP-9 antibody, etanercept (positive control) or isotype antibody (negative control) for 6 weeks. Anti-MMP-9 and the isotype control had comparable high serum exposures and expected terminal half-life. The relapse rate in mice receiving standard TB treatment was 46.6%. Compared to the standard TB treatment, relapse rates in animals that received adjunctive treatments with anti-MMP-9 antibody or etanercept were significantly decreased to 25.9% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) and 29.8% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019) respectively, but were not different from the arm that received the isotype control antibody (25.9%). Immunostaining demonstrated localization of MMP-9 primarily in macrophages in both murine and human lung tissues infected with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting the importance of MMP-9 in TB pathogenesis. These data suggest that the relapse rates in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice may be non-specifically improved by administration of antibodies in conjunction with standard TB treatments.

Anaemia is a condition in which the haemoglobin concentration falls below an established cut-off value due to a decrease in the number and size of red blood cells. The current study aimed (i) to assess the spatial pattern and (ii) to identify determinants related to anaemia using the third Ethiopian demographic health survey. To achieve these objectives, this study took into account the sampling weight and the clustered nature of the data. As a result, multilevel modeling has been used in the statistical analysis. The analysis included complete cases from 15,909 females, and 13,903 males. Among all subjects who agreed for hemeoglobin test, 5.22% males, and 16.60% females were anemic. In both binary and ordinal outcome modeling approaches, educational level, age, wealth index, BMI and HIV status were found to be significant predictors of anaemia prevalence. Furthermore, this study applied spatial methods to generate maps at regional level which could be useful for policy makers where great efforts should be concentrated to reduce the prevalence of anaemia. As revealed by Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; test, significant spatial autocorrelation were noted across clusters. The risk of anaemia was found to vary across different regions, and higher prevalences were observed in Somali and Affar regions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bedilu Alamirie Ejigu, Eshetu Wencheko, Kiros Berhane&lt;/p&gt;

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of acupuncture, sham acupuncture and drugs in the treatment of chronic constipation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of acupuncture and drugs for chronic constipation were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases (such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and CBM) up to December 2017. Additional references were obtained from review articles. With quality evaluations and data extraction, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using a random-effects model under a frequentist framework. A total of 40 studies (n = 11032) were included: 39 were high-quality studies and 1 was a low-quality study. NMA showed that (1) acupuncture improved the symptoms of chronic constipation more effectively than drugs; (2) the ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome was acupuncture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, sham acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo; (3) the ranking of side effects were as follows: lactulose, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, prucalopride, linaclotide, placebo and tegaserod; and (4) the most commonly used acupuncture point for chronic constipation was ST25. Acupuncture is more effective than drugs in improving chronic constipation and has the least side effects. In the future, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to prove this. Sham acupuncture may have curative effects that are greater than the placebo effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform high-quality studies to support this finding. Polyethylene glycol also has acceptable curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lingping Zhu, Yunhui Ma, Xiaoyan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

NMA showed that (1) acupuncture improved the symptoms of chronic constipation more effectively than drugs; (2) the ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome was acupuncture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, sham acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo; (3) the ranking of side effects were as follows: lactulose, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, prucalopride, linaclotide, placebo and tegaserod; and (4) the most commonly used acupuncture point for chronic constipation was ST25. Acupuncture is more effective than drugs in improving chronic constipation and has the least side effects. In the future, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to prove this. Sham acupuncture may have curative effects that are greater than the placebo effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform high-quality studies to support this finding. Polyethylene glycol also has acceptable curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.</description><fingerprint>97ca617e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Comparison of acupuncture and other drugs for chronic constipation: A network meta-analysis</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196128</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33b97:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1525369184000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-e?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/503.5.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-e?rss=1</originId><engagement>2</engagement><author><name>Zahn, L.

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aaditya V.

Although it has been recognized that intestinal bacteria play an important role in the pathology of human ulcerative colitis (UC), specific pathogenic bacteria for UC have not been identified. We investigated the influence of &lt;i&gt;Paraclostridium bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 strain on the pathology of a UC mouse model and found it increased UC pathosis scores such as loose and bloody stools, reduced diversity of fecal flora, disappearance of the crypt structure of distal colon tissue, destruction of intestinal epithelial cells, and atrophy of the colon. Furthermore, we observed an increase in &lt;i&gt;COX-2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF-α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-17&lt;/i&gt; expression and a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Foxp3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; expression, as inflammation-related factors and inflammatory cytokines, a decrease in the concentration of short chain fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) in feces, and an increase of intestinal mucosal myeloperoxidase activity. These results suggest that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 is a pathology-exacerbating factor in a mouse model of UC. This study is the first to demonstrate exacerbation of the pathological condition in a mouse model of UC by a single bacterial strain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Kutsuna, Junko Tomida, Yuji Morita, Yoshiaki Kawamura&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient’s life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (post-treatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48).

Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beau Oldenburg, Marijtje Van Duijn, René Veenstra&lt;/p&gt;

The relative age effect is a well-researched phenomenon, however there is still a dearth of understanding in track and field and female sport. This study investigated the role of relative age on selection for international competition of Spanish age group athletes between 2006–2014. Six hundred and forty two athletes competed for Spain at U20 or U18 age group international competition (n = 359 males; 283 females) across 9 years. The birthdates of these athletes were compared against the population of registered athletes at that time (14,502 males; 10,096 females). The results highlighted the influential role of relative age on selection to these opportunities. In line with previous research, this effect was mediated by age and gender, with stronger effects for both males and younger athletes (U18). The data best supported the ‘maturation-selection’ hypothesis as a mechanism for RAEs. These results highlight the need to carefully consider the role and need for international competitive opportunities at different age groups. A number of possible context relevant solutions are discussed, including correction adjustments techniques and competition structure within track and field.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Javier Brazo-Sayavera, María Asunción Martínez-Valencia, Lisa Müller, Georgios Andronikos, Russell J.

Our aims were to quantify and map the plant sub regions of the the Caatinga, that covers 844,453 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is the largest block of seasonally dry forest in South America. We performed spatial analyses of the largest dataset of woody plant distributions in this region assembled to date (of 2,666 shrub and tree species; 260 localities), compared these distributions with the current phytogeographic regionalizations, and investigated the potential environmental drivers of the floristic patterns in these sub regions. Phytogeographical regions were identified using quantitative analyses of species turnover calculated as Simpson dissimilarity index. We applied an interpolation method to map NMDS axes of compositional variation over the entire extent of the Caatinga, and then classified the compositional dissimilarity according to the number of biogeographical sub regions identified a priori using k-means analysis. We used multinomial logistic regression models to investigate the influence of contemporary climatic productivity, topographic complexity, soil characteristics, climate stability since the last glacial maximum, and the human footprint in explaining the identified sub regions. We identified nine spatially cohesive biogeographical sub regions. Current productivity, as indicated by an aridity index, was the only explanatory variable retained in the best model, explaining nearly half of the floristic variability between sub regions. The highest rates of endemism within the Caatinga were in the Core and Periphery Chapada Diamantina sub regions. Our findings suggest that the topographic complexity, soil variation, and human footprint in the Caatinga act on woody plant distributions at local scales and not as determinants of broad floristic patterns. The lack of effect of climatic stability since the last glacial maximum probably results from the fact that a single measure of climatic stability does not adequately capture the highly dynamic climatic shifts the region suffered during the Pleistocene. There was limited overlap between our results and previous Caatinga classifications.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Augusto C. Silva, Alexandre F.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β1(unit for all markers: pg/mL) were increased from baseline by smaller increments in the navigation TKA cohort compared with the conventional TKA group at 24 hours (17.06 vs 29.39, p = 0.02; 0.51 vs 0.83, p = 0.16; –0.04 vs 0.36, p &amp;lt; 0.01 and –48.18 vs 63.24, p&amp;lt; 0.01, respectively) and at 72 hours (12.27 vs 16.87, p = 0.01; –0.40 vs 0.48, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 0.58 vs 0.98, p = 0.07 and –55.16 vs 63.71, p &amp;lt; 0.01, respectively). IL-10 levels in drainage fluids collected 24 hours after TKA were also significantly lower in the navigation group versus the conventional TKA group (8.55 vs 12.32, p &amp;lt; 0.01).

Reconfigurations of synchronized large-scale networks are thought to be central neural mechanisms that support cognition and behavior in the human brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings together with recent advances in network analysis now allow for sub-second snapshots of such networks. In the present study, we compared frequency-resolved functional connectivity patterns underlying reading of single words and visual recognition of symbol strings. Word reading emphasized coherence in a left-lateralized network with nodes in classical perisylvian language regions, whereas symbol processing recruited a bilateral network, including connections between frontal and parietal regions previously associated with spatial attention and visual working memory. Our results illustrate the flexible nature of functional networks, whereby processing of different form categories, written words vs. symbol strings, leads to the formation of large-scale functional networks that operate at distinct oscillatory frequencies and incorporate task-relevant regions. These results suggest that category-specific processing should be viewed not so much as a local process but as a distributed neural process implemented in signature networks. For words, increased coherence was detected particularly in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and high gamma (60–90 Hz) frequency bands, whereas increased coherence for symbol strings was observed in the high beta (21–29 Hz) and low gamma (30–45 Hz) frequency range. These findings attest to the role of coherence in specific frequency bands as a general mechanism for integrating stimulus-dependent information across brain regions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mia Liljeström, Johanna Vartiainen, Jan Kujala, Riitta Salmelin&lt;/p&gt;

These findings attest to the role of coherence in specific frequency bands as a general mechanism for integrating stimulus-dependent information across brain regions.</description><fingerprint>a29de002</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Large-scale functional networks connect differently for processing words and symbol strings</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559165:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><updated>1525986000000</updated><published>1525986000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197416</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197416</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197416</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Małgorzata Grzesiuk</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>b8f9da46</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: How cyclophosphamide at environmentally relevant concentration influences &amp;lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&amp;lt;/i&gt; life history and its proteome</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197416</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559158:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><updated>1525986000000</updated><published>1525986000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197194</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197194</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197194</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Stefan Nagel</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Nagel, Corinna Meyer, Maren Kaufmann, Margarete Zaborski, Roderick A.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematopoietic malignancy originating from T-cell progenitors in which differentiation is blocked at early stages. Physiological expression of specific NKL homeobox genes obeys a hematopoietic NKL-code implicated in the process of lymphopoiesis while in differentiated T-cells these genes are silenced. We propose that this developmental expression pattern underlies the observation that NKL homeobox genes are the most ubiquitous group of transcription factors deregulated in T-ALL, including TLX1, TLX3, NKX2-5 and NKX3-1. Here, we describe a novel member of the NKL homeobox gene subclass, NKX3-2 (BAPX1), which is aberrantly activated in 18% of pediatric T-ALL patients analyzed while being normally expressed in developing spleen. Identification of NKX3-2 expression in T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM qualified these cells to model its deregulation and function in a leukemic context. Genomic and chromosomal analyses demonstrated normal configuration of the NKX3-2 locus at chromosome 4p15, thus excluding cytogenetic dysregulation. Comparative expression profiling analysis of NKX3-2 patient data revealed deregulated activity of BMP- and MAPK-signalling. These candidate pathways were experimentally confirmed to mediate aberrant NKX3-2 expression. We also show that homeobox gene SIX6, plus MIR17HG and GATA3 are downstream targets of NKX3-2 and plausibly contribute to the pathogenesis of this malignancy by suppressing T-cell differentiation. Finally, NKL homeobox gene NKX2-5 was activated by NKX3-2 in CCRF-CEM and by FOXG1 in PEER, representing mutually inhibitory activators of this translocated oncogene. Together, our findings reveal a novel oncogenic NKL homeobox gene subclass member which is aberrantly expressed in a large subset of T-ALL patients and participates in a deregulated gene network likely to arise in developing spleen.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Nagel, Corinna Meyer, Maren Kaufmann, Margarete Zaborski, Roderick A.

Mesothelin is a cell surface protein that is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, liver, and pancreatic tumors. Aberrant expression of mesothelin has been shown to promote tumor progression and metastasis through interaction with established tumor biomarker CA125. Therefore, molecules that specifically bind to mesothelin have potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, no mesothelin-targeting molecules are currently approved for routine clinical use. While antibodies that target mesothelin are in development, some clinical applications may require a targeting molecule with an alternative protein fold. For example, non-antibody proteins are more suitable for molecular imaging and may facilitate diverse chemical conjugation strategies to create drug delivery complexes. In this work, we engineered variants of the fibronectin type III domain (Fn3) non-antibody protein scaffold to bind to mesothelin with high affinity, using directed evolution and yeast surface display. Lead engineered Fn3 variants were solubly produced and purified from bacterial culture at high yield. Upon specific binding to mesothelin on human cancer cell lines, the engineered Fn3 proteins internalized and co-localized to early endosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-antibody proteins engineered to bind mesothelin. The results validate that non-antibody proteins can be engineered to bind to tumor biomarker mesothelin, and encourage the continued development of engineered variants for applications such as targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allison R.

The white-backed planthopper, &lt;i&gt;Sogatella furcifera&lt;/i&gt;, is a phloem sap feeder that secretes watery and gelling saliva during feeding. In this study, we identified the major proteins in watery saliva of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;furcifera&lt;/i&gt; by shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis combined with transcriptomic analysis. A total of 161 proteins were identified, which were divided into 8 function categories, including enzymes, transporter, calcium ion binding protein, salivary sheath protein, cytoskeleton protein, DNA-, RNA-, and protein-binding or regulating proteins, other non-enzyme proteins and unknown proteins. Gene expression pattern of 11 secretory proteins were analyzed by real time quantitative-PCR. We detected the mucin-like protein, which had a unique expression level in salivary gland, most likely to be a candidate effector involved in regulation of plant defense. This study identified the watery saliva component of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;furcifera&lt;/i&gt; and it provided a list of proteins which may play a role in interaction between &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;furcifera&lt;/i&gt; and rice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Tong Miao, Yao Deng, Hao-Kang Jia, Yu-Di Liu, Mao-Lin Hou&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of two forms (CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CuS); and Cu nanoparticles (CuNP)) and dosages (standard 6.5 mg/kg (H), half of the standard (L)) of additional dietary Cu administered to growing rats on gastrointestinal and hepatic function and morphology. Copper in the form of CuNP vs CuS caused lower Cu faecal/urinal excretion and increased Cu accumulation in the brain tissue. Hepatic high-grade hydropic degeneration and necrotic lesions were observed only in the CuNP-H animals. In the lower gut, the dietary application of CuNP stifled bacterial enzymatic activity of caecal gut microbiota and resulted in lower SCFA production. That diminishing effect of CuNP on caecal microbiota activity was accompanied by a relative increase in the secretion of glycoside hydrolases by bacterial cells. The results showed that in comparison to Cu from CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cu nanoparticles to a greater extent were absorbed from the intestine, accumulated in brain tissue, exerted antimicrobial effect in the caecum, and at higher dietary dose caused damages in the liver of rats.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ewelina Cholewińska, Katarzyna Ognik, Bartosz Fotschki, Zenon Zduńczyk, Jerzy Juśkiewicz&lt;/p&gt;

In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;

These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</description><fingerprint>7c17d2c4</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>High throughput nonparametric probability density estimation</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b35d987:153251f:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525975210375</crawled><updated>1525986000000</updated><published>1525986000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197531</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197531</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197531</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ying-Ying Zhang</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ying-Ying Zhang, Xue Han, Ye Liu, Jian Chen, Lei Hua, Qian Ma, Yang-Yu-Xin Huang, Qiong-Yao Tang, Zhe Zhang&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ying-Ying Zhang, Xue Han, Ye Liu, Jian Chen, Lei Hua, Qian Ma, Yang-Yu-Xin Huang, Qiong-Yao Tang, Zhe Zhang&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>e72fb2b2</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: +mRNA expression of LRRC55 protein (leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 55) in the adult mouse brain</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197531</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16368e2285f:3fa1a20:3dd877af</id><crawled>1526473042015</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1526454000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5</originId><engagement>7</engagement><author><name>Luciano Floridi</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05154-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05154-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Romans would have denied robots legal personhood</description><fingerprint>7a0abceb</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Romans would have denied robots legal personhood</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05154-5</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_1636132d90e:1006c7f:f3bf0074</id><crawled>1526344112398</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1526270400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00114</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00114</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00114</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Aleksey I.

First discovered for their role in mediating programmed cell death and inflammatory responses, caspases have now emerged as crucial regulators of other cellular and physiological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. In the developing nervous system, for instance, the non-apoptotic functions of caspases have been shown to play critical roles in the formation of neuronal circuits by regulating axon outgrowth, guidance and pruning. How caspase activity is spatially and temporally maintained at sub-lethal levels within cells remains however poorly understood, especially in vivo. Thanks to its transparency and accessibility, the zebrafish offers the unique ability to directly visualize caspase activation in vivo. Yet, detailed information about the caspase family in zebrafish is lacking. Here, we report the identification and characterization of 19 different caspase genes in zebrafish, and show that caspases have diverse expression profiles from cleavage to larval stages, suggesting highly specialized and/or redundant functions during embryonic development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olivia Spead, Tine Verreet, Cory J.

In the developing nervous system, for instance, the non-apoptotic functions of caspases have been shown to play critical roles in the formation of neuronal circuits by regulating axon outgrowth, guidance and pruning. How caspase activity is spatially and temporally maintained at sub-lethal levels within cells remains however poorly understood, especially in vivo. Thanks to its transparency and accessibility, the zebrafish offers the unique ability to directly visualize caspase activation in vivo. Yet, detailed information about the caspase family in zebrafish is lacking. Here, we report the identification and characterization of 19 different caspase genes in zebrafish, and show that caspases have diverse expression profiles from cleavage to larval stages, suggesting highly specialized and/or redundant functions during embryonic development.</description><fingerprint>521a0791</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization of the caspase family in zebrafish</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197966</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1634619c5fc:d47db8:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525889484284</crawled><published>1525888246000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaar5894?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/440/eaar5894.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaar5894?rss=1</originId><engagement>2</engagement><author><name>de Masson, A., OMalley, J.

We demonstrate that DeepPVP performs significantly better than existing methods, including phenotype-based methods that use similar features. DeepPVP is freely available at https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/phenomenet-vp Conclusions: DeepPVP further improves on existing variant prioritization methods both in terms of speed as well as accuracy.</description><fingerprint>369d2584</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>DeepPVP: phenotype-based prioritization of causative variants using deep learning [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/311621v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162f321c452:5f4d84b:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1524497499218</crawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04960-1/d41586-018-04960-1_15708564.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><published>1524466800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04960-1</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04960-1</originId><engagement>3</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More whiplash weather in store for California&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More whiplash weather in store for California, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04960-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04960-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Swings from baking drought to extreme downpours will be more common, scientists warn.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More whiplash weather in store for California&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More whiplash weather in store for California, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04960-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04960-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Swings from baking drought to extreme downpours will be more common, scientists warn.</description><fingerprint>2a97ddac</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>More whiplash weather in store for California</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04960-1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162f1d3233c:5d86538:34f43e70</id><crawled>1524475568956</crawled><published>1524466800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03836-2</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03836-2</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03836-2</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Mariana Schroeder</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Placental miR-340 mediates vulnerability to activity based anorexia in mice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placental miR-340 mediates vulnerability to activity based anorexia in mice, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03836-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03836-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Anorexia nervosa is characterised by self-starvation but its etiology is not completely understood.

NANOG has been demonstrated to play an essential role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, and its pseudogene, NANOGP8, is suggested to promote the cancer stem cell phenotype. As the roles of these genes are intimately involved with glioblastoma multiforme progression and exosomes are critical in intercellular communication, we conducted a detailed analysis of the association of the NANOG gene family with exosomes to identify diagnostic markers for cancer. Exosomes were precipitated from conditioned culture media from various cell lines, and NANOG gene fragments were directly amplified without DNA isolation using multiple primer sets. The use of the enzymes AlwNI and SmaI with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis functioned to distinguish NANOGP8 from other NANOG family members. Collectively, results suggest that the NANOG DNA associated with exosomes is not full length and that mixed populations of the NANOG gene family exist. Furthermore, sequence analysis of exosomal DNA amplified with a NANOGP8 specific primer set frequently showed an insertion of a 22 bp sequence into the 3’ UTR. The occurrence rate of this insertion was significantly higher in exosomal DNA clones from cancer cells as compared to normal cells. We have detected mixed populations of NANOG DNA associated with exosomes and have identified preferential modulations in the sequences from cancer samples. Our findings, coupled with the properties of exosomes, may allow for the detection of traditionally inaccessible cancers (i.e. GBM) through minimally invasive techniques. Further analysis of exosomal DNA sequences of NANOG and other embryonic stemness genes (OCT3/4, SOX2, etc.) may establish a robust collection of exosome based diagnostic markers, and further elucidate the mechanisms of cancer formation, progression, and metastasis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Manjusha Vaidya, Michael Bacchus, Kiminobu Sugaya&lt;/p&gt;

Little is known about people’s ability to detect subclinical psychopathy from others’ quotidian social behavior, or about the correlates of variation in this ability. This study sought to address these questions using a thin slice personality judgment paradigm. We presented 108 undergraduate judges (70.4% female) with 1.5 minute video thin slices of zero-acquaintance triadic conversations among other undergraduates (targets: n = 105, 57.1% female). Judges completed self-report measures of general trust, caution, and empathy. Target individuals had completed the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP) scale.

Little is known about people’s ability to detect subclinical psychopathy from others’ quotidian social behavior, or about the correlates of variation in this ability. This study sought to address these questions using a thin slice personality judgment paradigm. We presented 108 undergraduate judges (70.4% female) with 1.5 minute video thin slices of zero-acquaintance triadic conversations among other undergraduates (targets: n = 105, 57.1% female). Judges completed self-report measures of general trust, caution, and empathy. Target individuals had completed the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP) scale. Judges viewed the videos in one of three conditions: complete audio, silent, or audio from which semantic content had been removed using low-pass filtering. Using a novel other-rating version of the LSRP, judges’ ratings of targets’ primary psychopathy levels were significantly positively associated with targets’ self-reports, but only in the complete audio condition. Judge general trust and target LSRP interacted, such that judges higher in general trust made less accurate judgments with respect to targets higher in primary and total psychopathy. Results are consistent with a scenario in which psychopathic traits are maintained in human populations by negative frequency dependent selection operating through the costs of detecting psychopathy in others.</description><fingerprint>fc0b7ccc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>General trust impedes perception of self-reported primary psychopathy in thin slices of social interaction</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d745:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><updated>1524862800000</updated><published>1524862800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196333</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196333</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196333</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jessica R.

Few studies have estimated the economic burden of chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers) attributable to unhealthy eating. In this study, we estimated the economic burden of chronic disease attributable to not meeting Canadian food recommendations. We first obtained chronic disease risk estimates for intakes of both protective (1. vegetables; 2. fruit; 3. whole grains; 4. milk; 5. nuts and seeds) and harmful (6. processed meat; 7. red meat; 8. sugar-sweetened beverages) foods from the Global Burden of Disease Study, and food intakes from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey 24-hour dietary recalls (n = 33,932 respondents). We then calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) for all relevant food-chronic disease combinations by age and sex groups. These PAFs were then mathematically combined for each disease for each age and sex group. We then estimated attributable costs by multiplying these combined PAFs with estimated 2014 annual direct health care (hospital, drug, physician) and indirect (human capital approach) costs for each disease. We found that not meeting recommendations for the eight foods was responsible for CAD$13.8 billion/year (direct health care: CAD$5.1 billion, indirect: CAD$8.7 billion). Nuts and seeds and whole grains were the top cost contributors rather than vegetables and fruit. Our findings suggest that unhealthy eating constitutes a tremendous economic burden to Canada that is similar in magnitude to the burden of smoking and larger than that of physical inactivity which were estimated using similar approaches. A status quo in promotion of healthy eating will allow this burden to continue. Interventions to reduce the health and economic burden of unhealthy eating in Canada may be more effective if they are broad in focus and include promotion of nuts and seeds and whole grains along with vegetables and fruit rather than have a narrow focus such as primarily on vegetables and fruit.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica R.

Wild bees are essential pollinators whose survival partly depends on the capacity of their environment to offer a sufficient amount of nectar and pollen. Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, &lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&lt;/i&gt;, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Colin Van Reeth, Gaël Caro, Christian Bockstaller, Nadia Michel&lt;/p&gt;

The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, “self” protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of “self” antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Frasca, Alain Diaz, Maria Romero, Seth Thaller, Bonnie B.

Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. It can alleviate the damage of heavy metal ions, and other chemical substances, changes in temperature and humidity, oxidative stress in higher plants, and enhance resistance of plants to abiotic stress. The transformation of N-Acetyl-5-hydroxy tryptamin into melatonin requires the involvement of methyltransferase. In this study, a methyltransferase gene &lt;i&gt;ZjOMT&lt;/i&gt; has been cloned from &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. The gene was induced by aluminum (Al) stress in the leaves and roots of &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;, and was up-regulated by 20.86- and 31.18-folds, respectively. The expression of ZjOMT in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increased the content of melatonin by about 8-fold in the recombinant strain compared with that of the empty vector strain. Al resistance test showed that the resistance of recombinant strain BL21-pET32-ZjOMT to Al was significantly higher than that of the empty vector strain BL21-pET32. The survival rate of the recombinant strain expressing ZjOMT was about 100-fold higher than that of the empty vector strain when treated with 0.35 mM Al. These findings suggest that the heterologous expression of ZjOMT improved the resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to Al by increasing the content of melatonin.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongsong Luo, Chunyan He, Liebao Han&lt;/p&gt;

These findings suggest that the heterologous expression of ZjOMT improved the resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to Al by increasing the content of melatonin.</description><fingerprint>5455013e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Heterologous expression of ZjOMT from &amp;lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&amp;lt;/i&gt; in &amp;lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; confers aluminum resistance through melatonin production</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196952</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163495bea83:125a9f4:2835af05</id><crawled>1525944150659</crawled><published>1525935600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Mi Ri Park</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Probiotic &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotic &amp;lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&amp;lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25333-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Probiotic &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dJ4_7Qwrtr4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Probiotic &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotic &amp;lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&amp;lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25333-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Probiotic &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dJ4_7Qwrtr4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>fcda161b</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans through a nuclear hormone receptor</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/dJ4_7Qwrtr4/s41598-018-25333-8</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16364ca7c57:39f3a14:93d646dc</id><crawled>1526404381783</crawled><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/20/5175/F1.medium.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>186</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><published>1526400367000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5175.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5175</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5175.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Peng-Lu Pan, Yu-Xuan Ye, Yi-Han Lou, Jia-Bao Lu, Chen Cheng, Yan Shen, Bernard Moussian, Chuan-Xi Zhang</name></author><content><content>Cuticle, mainly composed of chitin and cuticular proteins (CPs), is a multifunctional structure of arthropods.

The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways. Some behavioral evidence exists to support this role, whereby neurogenesis-deficient rodents are impaired at discriminating the fine visuospatial details of experiences.

The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways.

For the Be2B8Lin (n = 1–8) and the Be2B36Lin (n = 1–20) systems, lithium salts are dominant whereas a clear electride feature shows up for Be2B8Lin (n = 9–14) and Be2B36Li21. Addition of hydrogen radicals to these systems shows that the Be2B8Li14 electride becomes a Be2B8Li14H2 hydride electride whereas Be2B36Li21 leads to a Be2B36Li21H salt. Moreover, for the addition of Li atoms to Be2B8 and the Be2B36 backbones, large values of the interaction and of the adsorption energy per Li atom, high specific capacity of Be2B8Li14 and of Be2B36Li21 (1860 and 1017 mAh g−1, respectively) and low and flat voltage associated with lithiation have been found.

This study describes differences in species richness and composition of the assemblages of galling insects and their host plants at different spatial scales. Sampling was conducted along altitudinal gradients composed of &lt;i&gt;campos rupestres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;campos de altitude&lt;/i&gt; of two mountain complexes in southeastern Brazil: Espinhaço Range and Mantiqueira Range. The following hypotheses were tested: i) local and regional richness of host plants and galling insects are positively correlated; ii) beta diversity is the most important component of regional diversity of host plants and galling insects; and iii) Turnover is the main mechanism driving beta diversity of both host plants and galling insects. Local richness of galling insects and host plants increased with increasing regional richness of species, suggesting a pattern of unsaturated communities. The additive partition of regional richness (γ) into local and beta components shows that local richnesses (α) of species of galling insects and host plants are low relative to regional richness; the beta (β) component incorporates most of the regional richness. The multi-scale analysis of additive partitioning showed similar patterns for galling insects and host plants with the local component (α) incorporated a small part of regional richness. Beta diversity of galling insects and host plants were mainly the result of turnover, with little contribution from nesting. Although the species composition of galling insects and host plant species varied among sample sites, mountains and even mountain ranges, local richness remained relatively low. In this way, the addition of local habitats with different landscapes substantially affects regional richness. Each mountain contributes fundamentally to the composition of regional diversity of galling insects and host plants, and so the design of future conservation strategies should incorporate multiple scales.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marcel Serra Coelho, Marco Antônio Alves Carneiro, Cristina Alves Branco, Rafael Augusto Xavier Borges, Geraldo Wilson Fernandes&lt;/p&gt;

Ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest and especially during sleep, suggesting that changes in the autonomic modulation may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher &lt;i&gt;HF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;nu&lt;/sub&gt; values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (&lt;i&gt;AUC&lt;/i&gt; = 0.92 ± 0.01; &lt;i&gt;Se&lt;/i&gt; = 0.91 ± 0.06; &lt;i&gt;Sp&lt;/i&gt; = 0.90 ± 0.05).

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

Since the accuracies of the ZMM have been revealed to be sufficient in previous studies, it is highly desirable to clarify its practical performance. In this paper, the performance of the ZMM is compared with that of the smooth particle mesh Ewald method (SPME), where the both methods are implemented in molecular dynamics software package GROMACS. Extensive performance comparisons against a highly optimized, parameter‐tuned SPME implementation are performed for various‐sized water systems and two protein–water systems. We analyze in detail the dependence of the performance on the potential parameters and the number of CPU cores. Even though the ZMM uses a larger cutoff distance than the SPME does, the performance of the ZMM is comparable to or better than that of the SPME. This is because the ZMM does not require a time‐consuming electrostatic convolution and because the ZMM gains short neighbor‐list distances due to the smooth damping feature of the pairwise potential function near the cutoff length. We found, in particular, that the ZMM with quadrupole or octupole cancellation and no damping factor is an excellent candidate for the fast calculation of electrostatic interactions. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><fingerprint>d511240c</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><summary><content>The zero‐multiple summation method (ZMM) is a cutoff‐based method for calculating electrostatic interactions in molecular dynamics simulations, utilizing an electrostatic neutralization principle as a physical basis.

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.

Merosin deficient congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;LAMA2&lt;/i&gt; gene leading to severe and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Although over 350 causative mutations have been identified for MDC1A, no treatment is yet available. There are many therapeutic approaches in development, but the lack of natural history data of the mouse model and standardized outcome measures makes it difficult to transit these pre-clinical findings to clinical trials. Therefore, in the present study, we collected natural history data and assessed pre-clinical outcome measures for the &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model using standardized operating procedures available from the TREAT-NMD Alliance. Wild type and &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice were subjected to five different functional tests from the age of four to 32 weeks. Non-tested control groups were taken along to assess whether the functional test regime interfered with muscle pathology. Respiratory function, body weights and creatine kinase levels were recorded. Lastly, skeletal muscles were collected for further histopathological and gene expression analyses. Muscle function of &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice was severely impaired at four weeks of age and all mice lost the ability to use their hind limbs. Moreover, respiratory function was altered in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Interestingly, the respiration rate was decreased and declined with age, whereas the respiration amplitude was increased in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice when compared to wild type mice. Creatine kinase levels were comparable to wild type mice. Muscle histopathology and gene expression analysis revealed that there was a specific regional distribution pattern of muscle damage in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Gastrocnemius appeared to be the most severely affected muscle with a high proportion of atrophic fibers, increased fibrosis and inflammation. By contrast, triceps was affected moderately and diaphragm only mildly. Our study presents a complete natural history dataset which can be used in setting up standardized studies in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by S.

In mountainous landscapes, soil moisture is highly dynamic due to the effects of topography and the temporal variability imposed by seasonal precipitation, including rainfall and snow. Soil moisture is known to affect ecosystem carbon exchange both aboveground and belowground, as well as the stable isotopic composition of exchanged CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this study we used an extensive suite of measurements to examine the effects of seasonal changes in soil moisture on the isotopic composition of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at the landscape level. We show that the seasonal decline in soil moisture (i.e., summer dry-down) appeared to impose a trend in the δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) with more negative δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; early in the growing season when soils were wet, and more positive δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; as the growing season progressed and soils dried out. This seemingly generalizable pattern for a snow-dominated watershed is likely to represent the variability of recently assimilated C, tracked through the plant-soil system and imprinted in the respired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, our observations suggest that, at least for mountainous environments, seasonal changes in δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; are largely mediated by soil moisture and their spatial variability is partially organized by topography.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego A.

Our report of a new selective catalyst for CO2 reduction illustrates how our modified Pourbaix diagrams can guide selective and efficient catalyst discovery.</description><fingerprint>45dccff9</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><summary><content>A critical challenge in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to renewable fuels is product selectivity.

Results provide strong evidence that flavor affects the topography behaviors of mean puff flow rate and mean puff volume, and there is insufficient evidence to support an influence of flavor on mean puff duration and mean puff interval.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Stereotactic radiotherapy, which delivers an ablative high radiation dose to a target volume for maximum local tumor control, requires a rapid dose fall-off outside the target volume to prevent extensive damage to nearby normal tissue. Currently, there is no tool to comprehensively evaluate the dose gradient near the target volume. We propose the dose gradient curve (DGC) as a new tool to evaluate the quality of a treatment plan with respect to the dose fall-off characteristics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The average distance between two isodose surfaces was represented by the dose gradient index (DGI) estimated by a simple equation using the volume and surface area of isodose levels. The surface area was calculated by mesh generation and surface triangulation. The DGC was defined as a plot of the DGI of each dose interval as a function of the dose. Two types of DGCs, &lt;i&gt;differential&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cumulative&lt;/i&gt;, were generated. The performance of the DGC was evaluated using stereotactic radiosurgery plans for virtual targets.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Over the range of dose distributions, the dose gradient of each dose interval was well-characterized by the DGC in an easily understandable graph format. Significant changes in the DGC were observed reflecting the differences in planning situations and various prescription doses.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The DGC is a rational method for visualizing the dose gradient as the average distance between two isodose surfaces; the shorter the distance, the steeper the dose gradient.

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the non–cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Françoise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional therapies, several new strategies have been proposed for modulating autoimmune diseases, including the adoptive transfer of immunological cells. In this context, dendritic cells (DCs) appear to be one of the most promising treatments for autoimmune disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of adoptive transfer of DCs obtained from both naïve and ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice on the severity of TNBS induced colitis and analyze the eventual protective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;To induce oral tolerance, BALB/c mice were fed 4mg/mL OVA solution for seven consecutive days. Spleen DCs were isolated from tolerant (tDC) and naïve (nDC) mice, and then adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Three days later, colitis was induced in DC treated mice by intrarectal instillation of 100μg2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol. Control subjects received only intrarectal instillation of either TNBS solution or a vehicle. Five days later, mice from all groups were euthanized and examined for physiological and immunological parameters. Regarding the phenotype, we observed that the frequencies of CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHC II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly lower in DCs isolated from tolerant mice than in those from naive mice. However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lisiery N.

However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>15856e54</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Adoptive transfer of dendritic cells expressing CD11c reduces the immunological response associated with experimental colitis in BALB/c mice</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196994</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b7:2835af05</id><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><updated>1526504400000</updated><published>1526504400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197414</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197414</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197414</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ariela L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several specialty societies participate in the Choosing Wisely (CW) campaign in an attempt to reduce waste in health care spending. We surveyed internal medicine (IM) residents with an objective of classifying knowledge of and confidence in using the American Society of Hematology (ASH) CW principles in hemostasis, thrombosis, and non-malignant hematology.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Multi-institutional study of IM residents at 5 academic training programs in the United States. A 10-question, case-based multiple choice test, with each question accompanied by a 5-point Likert-scale confidence assessment, was distributed electronically. Responses were summarized with frequencies and percentages or medians and ranges, as appropriate. Two sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare confidence and knowledge scores.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 892 IM residents, 174 (19.5%) responded to all questions. Overall, residents answered a median of 7 of 10 questions correctly (range 2–10) and median resident confidence in their responses was 3.1 (on a 5-point scale). Correct responses were significantly associated with higher confidence for all but one question. Having a hematology rotation experience was significantly associated with more correct responses and with higher confidence (&lt;i&gt;p = 0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt;, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IM residents at several academic hospitals have variable knowledge of ASH-CW guidelines in thrombosis and hemostasis/non-malignant hematology. Residents who have done hematology rotations, particularly a hematology consult rotation, were more likely to answer questions correctly and to be more confident that their answers were correct.

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Advanced liver fibrosis is an important predictor of liver disease progression and mortality, and current guidelines recommend screening for complications of cirrhosis once patients develop F3 fibrosis. Our study compared liver disease progression and survival in patients with stage 3 (F3) and stage 4 (F4) fibrosis on liver biopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study of patients with F3 or F4 on liver biopsy followed for development of liver disease complications (variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy); hepatocellular carcinoma, and survival (overall and transplant free survival).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2488 patients receiving liver biopsy between 01/02 and 12/12, a total of 294 (171 F3) were analyzed. Over a median follow up period of 3 years, patients with F4 (mean age 53 years, 63% male) compared to F3 (mean age 49 years, 43% male) had higher five year cumulative probability of any decompensation (38% vs. 14%, p&amp;lt;0.0001), including variceal bleed (10% vs. 4%, p = 0.014), ascites (21% vs. 9%, p = 0.0014), and hepatic encephalopathy (14% vs. 5%, p = 0.003). F4 patients also had lower overall 5-year survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.003) and transplant free survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.002). Probability of hepatocellular carcinoma in 5 years after biopsy was similar between F3 and F4 (1.2% vs. 2%, p = 0.54).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Compared to F4 stage, patients with F3 fibrosis have decreased risk for development of liver disease complications and better survival.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is now operationally defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an infection, identified by an acute change in SOFA-Score of at least two points, including clinical chemistry such as creatinine or bilirubin concentrations. However, little knowledge exists about organ-specific microRNAs as potentially new biomarkers. Accordingly, we tested the hypotheses that micro-RNA-122, the foremost liver-related micro-RNA (miR), 1) discriminates between sepsis and infection, 2) is an early predictor for mortality, and 3) improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-score.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed 108 patients with sepsis (infection + increase SOFA-Score ≥2) within the first 24h of ICU admission and as controls 20 patients with infections without sepsis (infection + SOFA-Score ≤1). Total circulating miR was isolated from serum and relative miR-122 expression was measured (using spiked-in cel-miR-54) and associated with 30-day survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;30-day survival of the sepsis patients was 63%. miR-122 expression was 40-fold higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001) and increased almost 6-fold in survivors (p = 0.013) compared to controls. miR-122 serum-expression discriminated both between sepsis vs. infection (AUC 0.760, sensitivity 58.3%, specificity 95%) and survivors vs. non-survivors (AUC 0.728, sensitivity 42.5%, specificity 94%). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed miR-122 (HR 4.3; 95%-CI 2.0–8.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) as independent prognostic factor for 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the predictive value for 30-day mortality of the SOFA-Score (AUC 0.668) was improved by adding miR-122 (AUC 0.743; net reclassification improvement 0.37, p&amp;lt;0.001; integrated discrimination improvement 0.07, p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Increased miR-122 serum concentration supports the discrimination between infection and sepsis, is an early and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, and improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-Score, suggesting a potential role for miR-122 in sepsis-related prediction models.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Rahmel, Simon T.

The biological properties of essential oils have been demonstrated in the treatment of several diseases and to enhance the bioavailability of other drugs. In natural habitats the essential oils compounds may play important roles in the protection of the plants as antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, insecticides and also against herbivores by reducing their appetite for such plants or by repelling undesirable others. We analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry the chemical composition of the essential oil of aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;Glandora rosmarinifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Ten.) D.C. Thomas obtained by hydrodistillation and verified some biological activities on a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231). In the essential oil we detected 35 compounds. The results of the biological assays indicate that essential oil of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rosmarinifolia&lt;/i&gt; induces cell growth inhibition at concentration-dependent way in all cell line models. This oil does not seem to possess antioxidant activity, while the cytotoxicity of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rosmarinifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil appeared to involve, at least in part, a pro-oxidant mechanism.

Before organizing mixed-mode data collection for the self-administered questionnaire of the Belgian Health Interview Survey, measurement effects between the paper-and-pencil and the web-based questionnaire were evaluated. A two-period cross-over study was organized with a sample of 149 employees of two Belgian research institutes (age range 22–62 years, 72% female). Measurement agreement was assessed for a diverse range of health indicators related to general health, mental and psychosocial health, health behaviors and prevention with kappa coefficients and intraclass correlation (ICC). The quality of the data collected by both modes was evaluated by quantifying the missing, ‘don’t know’ and inconsistent values and data entry mistakes. Good to very good agreement was found for all categorical indicators with kappa coefficients superior to 0.60, except for two mental and psychosocial health indicators namely the presence of a sleeping disorder and of a depressive disorder (kappa≥0.50). For the continuous indicators high to acceptable agreement was observed with ICC superior to 0.70. Inconsistent answers and data-entry mistakes were only occurring in the paper-and-pencil mode. There were no less missing values in the web-based mode compared to the paper-and-pencil mode. The study supports the idea that web-based modes provide, in general, equal responses to paper-and-pencil modes. However, health indicators based upon factual and objective items tend to have higher measurement agreement than indicators requiring an assessment of personal subjective feelings. A web-based mode greatly facilitates the data-entry process and guides the completing of a questionnaire. However, item non-response was not positively affected.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elise Braekman, Finaba Berete, Rana Charafeddine, Stefaan Demarest, Sabine Drieskens, Lydia Gisle, Geert Molenberghs, Jean Tafforeau, Johan Van der Heyden, Guido Van Hal&lt;/p&gt;

It is generally thought that varying levels of Emc define a prepattern that determines where proneural bHLH genes can be effective.

Emc is destabilized in proneural regions by local competition for heterodimer formation by proneural bHLH proteins including Atonal or AS-C proteins. Reflecting this post-translational control through protein stability, uniform &lt;i&gt;emc&lt;/i&gt; transcription is sufficient for almost normal patterns of neurogenesis.

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

Aims &lt;p&gt;Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), secreted primarily by atrial cardiomyocytes, decreases blood pressure by raising cyclic 3’,5’-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels and inducing vasorelaxation, natriuresis, and diuresis. Raising the level of ANP has been shown to be an effective treatment for hypertension. To advance the future development of an anti-microRNA (miR) approach to increasing expression of ANP, we investigated the regulation of &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression by two miRs: miR-425 and miR-155. We examined whether miR-425 and miR-155 have an additive effect on the expression and function of ANP.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) were transfected with miR-425, miR-155, or a combination of the two miRs. Two days later, &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was measured using real time qPCR. Each of the miRs decreased &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression over a wide range of concentrations, with a significant reduction at concentrations as low as 1 nM. The combination of miR-425 and miR-155 reduced &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression to a greater extent than either miR-425 or miR-155 alone. An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay was developed to study the potential biological significance of the miR-induced decrease in &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression. The cooperative effect of miR-425 and miR-155 on &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was associated with a significant decrease in cGMP levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that miR-425 and miR-155 regulate &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression in a cooperative manner.

These results suggest that synaptic vesicle proteins can be retrieved with ultrafast kinetics, although a majority of evoked fusion events are coupled to slower retrieval mechanisms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>Optical detection of three modes of endocytosis at hippocampal synapses</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36097</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163022e7324:22de0f:11c251fd</id><crawled>1524749988644</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1524726000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04973-w</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04973-w</originId><engagement>3</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abandoned fort holds clues to mass slaughter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abandoned fort holds clues to mass slaughter, Published online: 26 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04973-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04973-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The dead lay where they fell in their houses and the streets.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abandoned fort holds clues to mass slaughter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abandoned fort holds clues to mass slaughter, Published online: 26 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04973-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04973-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The dead lay where they fell in their houses and the streets.</description><fingerprint>945c85e3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Abandoned fort holds clues to mass slaughter</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04973-w</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16341385bca:5412e6:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525807602634</crawled><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/4875/F2.medium.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>326</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><published>1525803378000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4875.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4875</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4875.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Daniel L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remains a major cause of admission and inpatient mortality worldwide in children aged less than 5 years. In this study, we explored SAM prevalence and outcomes in children admitted in 13 Kenyan hospitals participating in a Clinical Information Network (CIN). We also describe their immediate in-patient management.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data for children aged 1–59 months collected retrospectively from medical records after discharge. Mean, median and ranges were used to summarize pooled and age-specific prevalence and mortality associated with SAM. Documentation of key signs and symptoms (S/S) and performance of indicators of quality of care for selected aspects of the WHO management steps were assessed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between documented S/S and mortality among SAM patients aged 6–59 months. Loess curves were used to explore performance change over time for indicators of selected SAM management steps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;5306/54140 (9.8%) children aged 1–59 months admitted with medical conditions in CIN hospitals between December 2013 and November 2016 had SAM. SAM prevalence identified by clinicians and case fatality varied widely across hospitals with median proportion (range) of 10.1% (4.6–18.2%) and 14.8% (6.0–28.6%) respectively. Seventeen variables were associated with increased mortality. Performance change over time of management steps varied across hospitals and across selected indicators but suggests some effect of regular audit and feedback.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Identification of SAM patients, their mortality and adherence to in-patient management recommendations varied across hospitals. An important group of SAM patients are aged less than 6 months. Continued efforts are required to improve management of SAM in routine settings as part of efforts to reduce inpatient mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susan Gachau, Grace Irimu, Philip Ayieko, Samuel Akech, Ambrose Agweyu, Mike English, on behalf of the Clinical Information Network Author Group &lt;/p&gt;

Although heterosis has significantly contributed to increases in worldwide crop production, the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are still unknown. In the present study, we used a comparative proteomic approach to explore hybrid vigor via the proteome of both the popcorn L54 ♀ and P8 ♂ genotypes and the resultant UENF/UEM01 hybrid cross. To analyze the differentially abundant proteins involved in heterosis, we used the primary roots of these genotypes to analyze growth parameters and extract proteins. The results of the growth parameter analysis showed that the mid- and best-parent heterosis were positive for root length and root dry matter but negative for root fresh matter, seedling fresh matter, and protein content. The comparative proteomic analysis identified 1343 proteins in the primary roots of hybrid UENF/UEM01 and its parental lines; 220 proteins were differentially regulated in terms of protein abundance. The mass spectrometry proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier “PXD009436”. A total of 62 regulated proteins were classified as nonadditive, of which 53.2% were classified as high parent abundance (+), 17.8% as above-high parent abundance (+ +), 16.1% as below-low parent abundance (− −), and 12.9% as low parent abundance (-). A total of 22 biological processes were associated with nonadditive proteins; processes involving translation, ribosome biogenesis, and energy-related metabolism represented 45.2% of the nonadditive proteins. Our results suggest that heterosis in the popcorn hybrid UENF/UEM01 at an early stage of plant development is associated with an up-regulation of proteins related to synthesis and energy metabolism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mathias F.

A total of 22 biological processes were associated with nonadditive proteins; processes involving translation, ribosome biogenesis, and energy-related metabolism represented 45.2% of the nonadditive proteins. Our results suggest that heterosis in the popcorn hybrid UENF/UEM01 at an early stage of plant development is associated with an up-regulation of proteins related to synthesis and energy metabolism.</description><fingerprint>29931a48</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Differentially abundant proteins associated with heterosis in the primary roots of popcorn</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197114</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16363c9e90a:38e659d:2835af05</id><crawled>1526387566858</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1526268744000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025190?af=R</link><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025190?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Minglang Wang</name></author><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><fingerprint>8147d7bb</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>Effect of molecular conformations on the electronic transport in oxygen-substituted alkanethiol molecular junctions</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025190?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1633f163918:14b0ac:2835af05</id><crawled>1525771811096</crawled><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04214-8/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4214_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>652</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><published>1525762800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04214-8</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04214-8</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04214-8</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Marios G.

AlH3(NMe3). ALD film growth experiments using TiCl4 and AlH2(tBuNCH2CH2NMe2) produced titanium carbonitride films with a high
growth rate of 1.6-2.0 Å/cycle and resistivities around 600 μΩ·cm within a very
wide ALD window of 220-400 °C. Importantly, film growth proceeded via
self-limited surface reactions, which is the hallmark of an ALD process. Root
mean square surface roughness was only 1.3 % of the film thickness at 300 °C by
atomic force microscopy. The films were polycrystalline with low intensity, broad
reflections corresponding to the cubic TiN/TiC phase according to grazing
incidence X-ray diffraction. Film composition by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy was approximately TiC0.8N0.5 at 300 °C with
small amounts of Al (6 at%), Cl (4 at%) and O (4 at%) impurities. Remarkably,
self-limited growth and low Al content was observed in films deposited well
above the solid-state thermal decomposition point of AlH2(tBuNCH2CH2NMe2), which is ca. 185 °C. Similar growth rates,

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß. Our findings define a novel role for AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes via its modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin and NF-κB signaling activities and the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Minashima, Thorsten Kirsch&lt;/p&gt;

Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 72.71% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 86.64%, indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq (pred) is 67.45%, which is not very high, indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 73.32% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 79.49%, indicating that 79.49% of the response variability can be explained by the model. Using the optimization software MODE Frontier (Optimization, MOGA-II, 2014), four types of response surfaces for the three considered response variables were tested for the data of DOE.

In this paper, an adaptive fractional order sliding mode control (AFSMC) scheme is designed for the current tracking control of the Boost-type converter in a Battery/Supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS). In order to stabilize the current, the adaptation rules based on state-observer and Lyapunov function are being designed. A fractional order sliding surface function is defined based on the tracking current error and adaptive rules. Furthermore, through fractional order analysis, the stability of the fractional order control system is proven, and the value of the fractional order (λ) is being investigated. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed AFSMC strategy is being verified by numerical simulations. The advantages of good transient response and robustness to uncertainty are being indicated by this design, when compared with a conventional integer order sliding mode control system.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jianlin Wang, Dan Xu, Huan Zhou, Tao Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

This package fits linear, binomial (logistic) and multinomial models, and provides a set of standard plots, summary statistics and output tables. eNetXplorer enables quantitative, exploratory analysis to generate hypotheses on which features may be associated with biological phenotypes of interest, such as in the identification of biomarkers for therapeutic responsiveness.</description><fingerprint>3b70c4f6</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>eNetXplorer: an R package for the quantitative exploration of elastic net families for generalized linear models [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/305870v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33b7d:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><published>1525369184000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/530?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/530.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/530?rss=1</originId><engagement>36</engagement><author><name>Feng, J., Luo, J., Yang, P., Du, J., Kim, B.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Systems (UAV or UAS) have become increasingly popular in recent years for agricultural research applications. UAS are capable of acquiring images with high spatial and temporal resolutions that are ideal for applications in agriculture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a UAS-based remote sensing system for quantification of crop growth parameters of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) including leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and yield. The study was conducted at the Texas A&amp;amp;M Research Farm near College Station, Texas, United States. A fixed-wing UAS equipped with a multispectral sensor was used to collect image data during the 2016 growing season (April–October). Flight missions were successfully carried out at 50 days after planting (DAP; 25 May), 66 DAP (10 June) and 74 DAP (18 June). These flight missions provided image data covering the middle growth period of sorghum with a spatial resolution of approximately 6.5 cm. Field measurements of LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were also collected. Four vegetation indices were calculated using the UAS images. Among those indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed the highest correlation with LAI, f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and yield with R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values of 0.91, 0.89 and 0.58 respectively. Empirical relationships between NDVI and LAI and between NDVI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were validated and proved to be accurate for estimating LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; from UAS-derived NDVI values. NDVI determined from UAS imagery acquired during the flowering stage (74 DAP) was found to be the most highly correlated with final grain yield. The observed high correlations between UAS-derived NDVI and the crop growth parameters (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, LAI and grain yield) suggests the applicability of UAS for within-season data collection of agricultural crops such as sorghum.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanaz Shafian, Nithya Rajan, Ronnie Schnell, Muthukumar Bagavathiannan, John Valasek, Yeyin Shi, Jeff Olsenholler&lt;/p&gt;

The Hedgehog family of morphogens has long been known to utilize, through the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), the heterotrimeric G protein G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in both canonical and noncanonical forms of signaling. Other G proteins, while not specifically utilized by Smo, may nonetheless provide access to some of the events controlled by it. We reported several years ago that the G protein G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; activates one or more forms of the Gli family of transcription factors. While the Gli transcription factors are well known targets for Smo, the uncertain mechanism of activation by G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and the identity of the targeted Gli(s) limited predictions as to the extent to which G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; might mimic Smo’s actions. We evaluate here the potential for overlap in G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and Smo signaling using C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells as models of osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We find in C3H10T1/2 cells that a constitutively active form of Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL) increases Gli1 mRNA, as does a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoA1). We find as well that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL induces alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenesis, albeit the induction is far less substantial than that achieved by SmoA1. In 3T3-L1 cells both Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 markedly suppress adipogenic differentiation as determined by triglyceride accumulation. RNA sequencing reveals that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 regulate many of the same genes but that quantitative and qualitative differences exist. Differences also exist, we find, between SmoA1 and purmorphamine, an agonist for Smo. Therefore, while comparisons of constitutively active proteins are informative, extrapolations to the setting of agonists require care.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xueshui Guo, Natalia A.

Microtubules are dynamic polymers required for a number of processes, including chromosome movement in mitosis. While regulators of microtubule dynamics have been well characterized, we lack a convenient way to predict how the measured dynamic parameters shape the entire microtubule system within a cell, or how the system responds when specific parameters change in response to internal or external signals. Here we describe a Monte Carlo model to simulate an array of dynamic microtubules from parameters including the cell radius, total tubulin concentration, microtubule nucleation rate from the centrosome, and plus end dynamic instability. The algorithm also allows dynamic instability or position of the cell edge to vary during the simulation. Outputs from simulations include free tubulin concentration, average microtubule lengths, length distributions, and individual length changes over time. Using this platform and reported parameters measured in interphase LLCPK1 epithelial cells, we predict that sequestering ~ 15–20% of total tubulin results in fewer microtubules, but promotes dynamic instability of those remaining. Simulations also predict that lowering nucleation rate will increase the stability and average length of the remaining microtubules. Allowing the position of the cell’s edge to vary over time changed the average length but not the number of microtubules and generated length distributions consistent with experimental measurements. Simulating the switch from interphase to prophase demonstrated that decreased rescue frequency at prophase is the critical factor needed to rapidly clear the cell of interphase microtubules prior to mitotic spindle assembly. Finally, consistent with several previous simulations, our results demonstrate that microtubule nucleation and dynamic instability in a confined space determines the partitioning of tubulin between monomer and polymer pools. The model and simulations will be useful for predicting changes to the entire microtubule array after modification to one or more parameters, including predicting the effects of tubulin-targeted chemotherapies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lynne Cassimeris, Jessica C.

The model and simulations will be useful for predicting changes to the entire microtubule array after modification to one or more parameters, including predicting the effects of tubulin-targeted chemotherapies.</description><fingerprint>f3a08dc7</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Monte Carlo simulations of microtubule arrays: The critical roles of rescue transitions, the cell boundary, and tubulin concentration in shaping microtubule distributions</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197538</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f66:2835af05</id><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><updated>1526072400000</updated><published>1526072400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196483</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196483</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196483</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Philipp Neubauer</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Neubauer, James T.

Fisheries management is most effective when based on scientific estimates of sustainable fishing rates. While some simple approaches allow estimation of harvest limits, more data-intensive stock assessments are generally required to evaluate the stock’s biomass and fishing rates relative to sustainable levels. Here we evaluate how stock characteristics relate to the rate of new assessments in the United States. Using a statistical model based on time-to-event analysis and 569 coastal marine fish and invertebrate stocks landed in commercial fisheries, we quantify the impact of region, habitat, life-history, and economic factors on the annual probability of being assessed. Although the majority of landings come from assessed stocks in all regions, less than half of the regionally-landed species currently have been assessed. As expected, our time-to-event model identified landed tonnage and ex-vessel price as the dominant factors determining increased rates of new assessments. However, we also found that after controlling for landings and price, there has been a consistent bias towards assessing larger-bodied species. A number of vulnerable groups such as rockfishes (Scorpaeniformes) and groundsharks (Carcharhiniformes) have a relatively high annual probability of being assessed after controlling for their relatively small tonnage and low price. Due to relatively low landed tonnage and price of species that are currently unassessed, our model suggests that the number of assessed stocks will increase more slowly in future decades.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Neubauer, James T.

&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values represent a widely used, but pervasively misunderstood and fiercely contested method of scientific inference. Display items, such as figures and tables, often containing the main results, are an important source of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. We conducted a survey comparing the overall use of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and the occurrence of significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items of a sample of articles in the three top multidisciplinary journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) in 2017 and, respectively, in 1997. We also examined the reporting of multiplicity corrections and its potential influence on the proportion of statistically significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Our findings demonstrated substantial and growing reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items, with increases of 2.5 to 14.5 times in 2017 compared to 1997. The overwhelming majority of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (94%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 92% to 96%) were statistically significant. Methods to adjust for multiplicity were almost non-existent in 1997, but reported in many articles relying on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in 2017 (Nature 68%, Science 48%, PNAS 38%). In their absence, almost all reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant (98%, 95% CI 96% to 99%). Conversely, when any multiplicity corrections were described, 88% (95% CI 82% to 93%) of reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant. Use of Bayesian methods was scant (2.5%) and rarely (0.7%) articles relied exclusively on Bayesian statistics. Overall, wider appreciation of the need for multiplicity corrections is a welcome evolution, but the rapid growth of reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and implausibly high rates of reported statistical significance are worrisome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ioana Alina Cristea, John P.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of xenobiotic mixtures containing persistent organic pollutants isolated from commercial fish oil samples against sex hormone receptors, including estrogen and androgen. The applied bioassay was based on transgenic yeast strains. The mixtures were extracted from the samples using the semi-permeable membrane dialysis technique and analyzed with gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. It turned out that mixtures of chemicals isolated from fish oil may interact with human steroid sex hormone receptors in various ways: the tested samples showed both estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Calculated 17β-estradiol equivalents for the tested samples ranged between 0.003 and 0.073 pg g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat). Anti-androgenic activity expressed as the flutamide equivalent concentration was in the 18.58–216.21 ng g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat) range. Polychlorinated biphenyls and various DDT metabolites were the main fish oil pollutants influencing the receptors. Additivity and/or synergy between chemicals was observed in the ER/AR mediated response.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marek Łukasz Roszko, Marta Kamińska, Krystyna Szymczyk, Katarzyna Piasecka-Jóźwiak, Beata Chabłowska&lt;/p&gt;

Intralesional (IL) injection of Rose Bengal (PV-10) induces regression of injected and uninjected lesions in several murine tumor models. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor response of combining IL PV-10 with blockade of the PD-1 / PD-L1 pathway and the role of immune cell populations in eliciting this response. To investigate the role of T cell subsets in mediating an immune response, B16 or M05 melanoma-bearing mice received combination therapy as well as CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; depleting antibodies. Tumor growth was measured. T cells were collected from spleens or tumors, and phenotype, activation markers, and reactivity were measured. Splenocytes from mice treated with combination therapy had increased OVA antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in M05-tumor-bearing mice. Depletion of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells or regulatory T cells (Tregs) in combination with IL PV-10 and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment resulted in an enhanced anti-tumor effect. Treatment with CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; depleting antibody abrogated anti-tumor immunity.

Upon their translocation into the mitochondrial matrix, the N-terminal pre-sequence of nuclear-encoded proteins undergoes cleavage by mitochondrial processing peptidases. Some proteins require more than a single processing step, which involves several peptidases. Down-regulation of the putative &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP) homolog by RNAi renders the cells unable to grow after 48 hours of induction. Ablation of MIP results in the accumulation of the precursor of the trypanosomatid-specific trCOIV protein, the largest nuclear-encoded subunit of the cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase complex in this flagellate. However, the trCOIV precursor of the same size accumulates also in trypanosomes in which either alpha or beta subunits of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) have been depleted. Using a chimeric protein that consists of the N-terminal sequence of a putative subunit of respiratory complex I fused to a yellow fluorescent protein, we assessed the accumulation of the precursor protein in trypanosomes, in which RNAi was induced against the alpha or beta subunits of MPP or MIP.

The observed accumulation of precursors indicates MIP depletion affects the activity of the cannonical MPP, or at least one of its subunits.</description><fingerprint>58b671fe</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Trypanosomal mitochondrial intermediate peptidase does not behave as a classical mitochondrial processing peptidase</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196474</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33b90:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1525369184000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-l?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/503.12.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-l?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Stern, P.</name></author><fingerprint>aa0d1cbe</fingerprint><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><unread>True</unread><title>Setting conscious perception alight</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-l?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162f1d1745e:5d8411e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1524475458654</crawled><published>1524466800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24715-2</href></item></canonical><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24715-2</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24715-2</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ying Li</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improvement of the phytoremediation efficiency of &lt;i&gt;Neyraudia reynaudiana&lt;/i&gt;

Merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP-7) is a multigene family expressed during malaria blood-stage infection. MSP-7 forms complex with MSP-1 prior to merozoite egress from erythrocytes, and could affect merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. To characterize sequence variation in the orthologue in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; (PvMSP-7), a gene member encoding PvMSP-7E was analyzed among 92 Thai isolates collected from 3 major endemic areas of Thailand (Northwest: Tak, Northeast: Ubon Ratchathani, and South: Yala and Narathiwat provinces). In total, 52 distinct haplotypes were found to circulate in these areas. Although population structure based on this locus was observed between each endemic area, no genetic differentiation occurred between populations collected from different periods in the same endemic area, suggesting spatial but not temporal genetic variation. Sequence microheterogeneity in both N- and C- terminal regions was predicted to display 4 and 6 α-helical domains, respectively. Signals of purifying selection were observed in α-helices II-X, suggesting structural or functional constraint in these domains. By contrast, α-helix-I spanning the putative signal peptide was under positive selection, in which amino acid substitutions could alter predicted CD4+ T helper cell epitopes. The central region of &lt;i&gt;PvMSP-7E&lt;/i&gt; comprised the 5’-trimorphic and the 3’-dimorphic subregions. Positive selection was identified in the 3’ dimorphic subregion of the central domain. A consensus of intrinsically unstructured or disordered protein was predicted to encompass the entire central domain that contained a number of putative B cell epitopes and putative protein binding regions. Evidences of intragenic recombination were more common in the central region than the remainders of the gene. These results suggest that the extent of sequence variation, recombination events and selective pressures in the &lt;i&gt;PvMSP-7E&lt;/i&gt; locus seem to be differentially affected by protein secondary structure.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chew Weng Cheng, Chaturong Putaporntip, Somchai Jongwutiwes&lt;/p&gt;

A consistent determinant of the establishment success of alien species appears to be the number of individuals that are introduced to found a population (propagule pressure), yet variation in the form of this relationship has been largely unexplored. Here, we present the first quantitative systematic review of this form, using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success has been evaluated for a broad range of taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants and long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. We found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success to be a feature of every hypothesis we tested. However, establishment success most critically depended on propagule pressures in the range of 10–100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. Conversely, no variation was accounted for in any analysis by the scale of study (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used. Our analyses reveal remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7aUJblC5EI4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Phillip Cassey, Steven Delean, Julie L.

The P8 stem-loop region of the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron, which is known to be hypervariable in size with multiple repeat motifs and created difficulties in alignment, is always excluded in phylogenetic as well as barcode analyses. This region was investigated for species discrimination in 98 taxa of orchids belonging to the tribe Vandeae using in silico mapping of restriction site polymorphism. The length of the P8 regions varied from 200 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Aerides rosea&lt;/i&gt; to 669 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Dendrophylax sallei&lt;/i&gt;. Forty two taxa had unique lengths, while as many as eight shared a common length of 521 nucleotides. Of the 35 restriction endonucleases producing digestions in the P8 regions, three, viz., &lt;i&gt;Ags&lt;/i&gt;I, &lt;i&gt;Apo&lt;/i&gt;I and &lt;i&gt;Tsp&lt;/i&gt;DTI turned out to have recognition sites across all the 98 taxa being studied. When their restriction data were combined, 92 taxa could be discriminated leaving three taxon pairs. However, &lt;i&gt;Acampe papillosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aeranthes arachnites&lt;/i&gt; despite having similar restriction sites differed in their P8 lengths.

The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a main regulator of cell survival, proliferation, motility, and platelet aggregation, and it is essential for angiogenesis and lymphocyte trafficking. In that S1P acts as a second messenger intra- and extracellularly, it might promote cancer progression. The main cause is found in the high S1P concentration in the blood, which encourage cancer cells to migrate through the endothelial barrier into the blood vessels. The irreversible degradation of S1P is solely caused by the sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1). SGPL1 overexpression reduces cancer cell migration and therefore silences the endogenous S1P siren, which promotes cancer cell attraction—the main reason for metastasis. Since our previous metabolomics studies revealed an increased SGPL1 activity in association with successful breast cancer cell treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, we further investigated expression and localization of SGPL1. Expression analyses confirmed a very low SGPL1 expression in all breast cancer samples, regardless of their subtype. Additionally, we were able to prove a novel SGPL expression in the cytoplasm membrane of non-tumorigenic breast cells by fusing three independent methods. The general SGPL1 downregulation and the loss of the plasma membrane expression resulted in S1P dependent stimulation of migration in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-20. Not only S1P stimulated migration could be repressed by overexpressing the natural SGPL1 variant not but also more general migratory activity was significantly reduced. Here, for the first time, we report on the SGPL1 plasma membrane location in human, non-malignant breast epithelial cell lines silencing the extracellular S1P siren &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and thereby regulating pivotal cellular functions. Loss of this plasma membrane distribution as well as low SGPL1 expression levels could be a potential prognostic marker and a viable target for therapy. Therefore, the precise role of SGPL1 for cancer treatment should be evaluated.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadja Engel, Anna Adamus, Marcus Frank, Karin Kraft, Juliane Kühn, Petra Müller, Barbara Nebe, Annika Kasten, Guido Seitz&lt;/p&gt;
The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a main regulator of cell survival, proliferation, motility, and platelet aggregation, and it is essential for angiogenesis and lymphocyte trafficking. In that S1P acts as a second messenger intra- and extracellularly, it might promote cancer progression. The main cause is found in the high S1P concentration in the blood, which encourage cancer cells to migrate through the endothelial barrier into the blood vessels. The irreversible degradation of S1P is solely caused by the sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1). SGPL1 overexpression reduces cancer cell migration and therefore silences the endogenous S1P siren, which promotes cancer cell attraction—the main reason for metastasis. Since our previous metabolomics studies revealed an increased SGPL1 activity in association with successful breast cancer cell treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, we further investigated expression and localization of SGPL1.

While many tropical countries are experiencing rapid deforestation, some have experienced forest transition (FT) from net deforestation to net reforestation. Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980–2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nobuo Imai, Takuya Furukawa, Riyou Tsujino, Shumpei Kitamura, Takakazu Yumoto&lt;/p&gt;

S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by De Chen, Linjie Luo, Chao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</description><fingerprint>de986340</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Aberrant &amp;lt;i&gt;S100A16&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression might be an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable survival in non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197402</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636a1605d4:43e1690:2835af05</id><crawled>1526493218260</crawled><published>1526454000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313411v2?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/16/313411</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313411v2?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Kalinin, A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the LMNA gene are a common cause (6–8%) of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leading to heart failure, a growing health care problem worldwide. The premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (HGPS) is also caused by defined mutations in the LMNA gene resulting in activation of a cryptic splice donor site leading to a defective truncated prelamin A protein called progerin. Low levels of progerin are expressed in healthy individuals associated with ageing. Here, we aimed to address the role of progerin in dilated cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;mRNA expression of progerin was analyzed in heart tissue of DCM (n = 15) and non-failing hearts (n = 10) as control and in blood samples from patients with DCM (n = 56) and healthy controls (n = 10). Sequencing confirmed the expression of progerin mRNA in the human heart. Progerin mRNA levels derived from DCM hearts were significantly upregulated compared to controls (1.27 ± 0.42 vs. 0.81 ± 0.24; p = 0.005). In contrast, progerin mRNA levels in whole blood cells were not significantly different in DCM patients compared to controls. Linear regression analyses revealed that progerin mRNA in the heart is significantly negatively correlated to ejection fraction (r = -0.567, p = 0.003) and positively correlated to left ventricular enddiastolic diameter (r = 0.551, p = 0.004) but not with age of the heart per se. Progerin mRNA levels were not influenced by inflammation in DCM hearts. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed increased expression of progerin protein in cell nuclei of DCM hearts associated with increased TUNEL+ apoptotic cells.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data suggest that progerin is upregulated in human DCM hearts and strongly correlates with left ventricular remodeling. Progerin might be involved in progression of heart failure and myocardial aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Moritz Messner, Santhosh Kumar Ghadge, Valentina Goetsch, Andreas Wimmer, Jakob Dörler, Gerhard Pölzl, Marc-Michael Zaruba&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to express a gene of interest in a spatio-temporal manner using Gal4-UAS system has allowed the use of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; model to study various biological phenomenon. During &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; eye development, a synchronous wave of differentiation called Morphogenetic furrow (MF) initiates at the posterior margin resulting in differentiation of retinal neurons. This synchronous differentiation is also observed in the differentiating retina of vertebrates. Since MF is highly dynamic, it can serve as an excellent model to study patterning and differentiation. However, there are not any Gal4 drivers available to observe the gain- of- function or loss- of- function of a gene specifically along the dynamic MF. The &lt;i&gt;decapentaplegic (dpp)&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes a secreted protein of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that expresses at the posterior margin and then moves with the MF. However, unlike the MF associated pattern of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene expression, the targeted &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver expression is restricted to the posterior margin of the developing eye disc. We screened GMR lines harboring regulatory regions of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; fused with Gal4 coding region to identify MF specific enhancer of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; using a GFP reporter gene. We employed immuno-histochemical approaches to detect gene expression. The rationale was that GFP reporter expression will correspond to the &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; expression domain in the developing eye. We identified two new &lt;i&gt;dpp-&lt;/i&gt;Gal4 lines, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 and &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 that carry sequences from first intron region of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene. &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression along the MF during development and later in the entire pupal retina whereas &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression of GFP transgene in the entire developing eye disc, which later drives expression only in the ventral half of the pupal retina. Thus, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 will serve as a new reagent for targeting gene expression in the ventral half of the pupal retina. We compared misexpression phenotypes of Wg, a negative regulator of eye development, using &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 with existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver. The eye phenotypes generated by using our newly identified MF specific driver are not similar to the ones generated by existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver. It suggests that misexpression studies along MF needs revisiting using the new Gal4 drivers generated in our studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ankita Sarkar, Neha Gogia, Kevin Farley, Lydia Payton, Amit Singh&lt;/p&gt;

In the United States (US), the sugarcane aphid (SCA) &lt;i&gt;Melanaphis sacchari&lt;/i&gt; (Zehnter) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was introduced in the 1970s, however at that time it was only considered a pest of sugarcane. In 2013, a massive outbreak of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sacchari&lt;/i&gt; occured on sorghum, resulting in significant economic damage to sorghum grown in North America including the US, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The aim of the present study was to determine if the SCA pest emergence in American sorghum resulted from the introduction of new genotypes. To this end we used microsatellite markers and COI sequencing to compare the genetic diversity of SCA populations collected in the Americas after the 2013 SCA outbreak on sorghum (during 2013–2017) to older samples collected before the pest outbreak (during 2007–2009). Our results show that the SCA outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean observed since 2013 belong to populations exhibiting low genetic diversity and consisting of a dominant clonal lineage, MLL-F, which colonizes &lt;i&gt;Sorghum&lt;/i&gt; spp. and sugarcane. The comparison of MLL-F specimens collected post-2013 with specimens collected in Louisiana in 2007 revealed that both populations are genetically distinct, according to COI sequencing and microsatellite data analyses. Our result suggest that MLL-F is a new invasive genotype introduced into the Americas that has spread rapidly across sorghum growing regions in the US, Mexico, Honduras and the Caribbean. The origin of this introduction is either Africa or Asia, with Asia being the most probable source.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Nibouche, Laurent Costet, Jocelyn R.

The origin of this introduction is either Africa or Asia, with Asia being the most probable source.</description><fingerprint>d320a996</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Invasion of sorghum in the Americas by a new sugarcane aphid (&amp;lt;i&gt;Melanaphis sacchari&amp;lt;/i&gt;) superclone</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196124</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16316b75941:1d489cb:4e164c41</id><crawled>1525094504769</crawled><published>1525094428000</published><recrawled>1525110664266</recrawled><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13495</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13495</originId><engagement>3</engagement><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;One of the more unusual drugs on the market is Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate). I went into its history a bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/02/tecfideras_price&quot;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re wondering how a molecule that small and unfunctionalized became a multiple sclerosis drug. As that shows, it went into trials for the disease with quite a bit of clinical rationale, but no clear molecular mechanism. So how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/449&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; has what could be the solution. It’s long been suspected that there’s a covalent mechanism at work, since the compound is an unsaturated small methyl ester (and thus potentially reactive with nucleophiles like cysteine). The history of allergic reactions in some patients fits in with that idea as well – you’d have to imagine that if it’s reacting with Cys residues that it’s capable of reacting with quite a few of them. One suspect had been a protein called KEAP1, which (along with its partner Nrf2) is a key player in inflammation, but that alone doesn’t seem to account for the drug’s effects. But now it looks like a more mechanistically important one has been tracked down: Cys150 of the enzyme GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one, as many will recognize, is responsible for a step in the glycolysis pathway. Why should messing with metabolism help out MS patients (and psoriasis patients as well, the drug’s original market)? Glycolysis is actually important for immune cell function: if you block it, macrophages cannot activate. The cell types affected after Tecfidera treatment are just those that are the most glycolitic (such as effector T cells), while Treg cells (among others) are left alone. Overall, the population of immune cells gets shifted around in ways that benefit autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates this in a number of convincing ways: if you incubate the enzyme with dimethyl or monomethyl fumarate, you can see the new mass adduct. And you see the same modified protein if you isolate GAPDH from the blood mononuclear cells of patients who have been taking Tecfidera for months as well. You get the same results from cell cultures and by dosing mice. The isolated enzyme shows dose- and time-dependent inhibition on treatment with either fumarate &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Looking more closely at the cells, the compound shows its effects on glycolysis in activated macrophages and lymphocytes, but not in resting cells, as shown by several downstream markers. This treatment also abrogates their immune functions (as shown by their response to the classic LPS antigen), and you can reproduce all these effects with a known GAPDH inhibitor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abcam.com/heptelidic-acid-koningic-acid-ab144269.html&quot;&gt;heptelidic&lt;/a&gt; acid). So yeah, this appears to be pretty nailed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also noted that fumarate is actually a downstream product of glycolysis, so it may be that dimethyl fumarate is just a prodrug for getting product inhibition of the pathway as well. None of this rules out other enzymes being modified by it, though – in fact, given its size and simplicity, other enzymes surely are. And the GAPDH-driven effects in other cells may also be important (it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4427661/&quot;&gt;already been suggested&lt;/a&gt; that it has metabolic effects in oligodendrocytes, although the mechanism wasn’t figured out). So what we have here is a small, simple, promiscuous covalent-inhibitor molecule that inactivates a ubiquitous enzyme that’s crucial to metabolic activity. And it’s a beneficial drug with a useful therapeutic index. Go figure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068918/&quot;&gt;a recent chemical proteomics effort&lt;/a&gt; on dimethyl fumarate, which identified a number of potential binding sites – but not this one on GAPDH! That’s worth thinking about (from both directions) and these sorts of disconnects may turn into a future blog post. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Patients with Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2) infection face a significantly higher risk of contracting HIV-1. This is thought to be due to herpetic lesions serving as entry points for HIV-1 and tissue-resident CD4+ T cell counts increasing during HSV-2 lesional events. We have created a stochastic and spatial mathematical model describing the dynamics of HSV-2 infection and immune response in the genital mucosa. Using our model, we first study the dynamics of a developing HSV-2 lesion. We then use our model to quantify the risk of infection with HIV-1 following sexual exposure in HSV-2 positive women. Untreated, we find that HSV-2 infected women are up to 8.6 times more likely to acquire HIV-1 than healthy patients. However, when including the effects of the HSV-2 antiviral drug, pritelivir, the risk of HIV-1 infection is predicted to decrease by up to 35%, depending on drug dosage. We estimate the relative importance of decreased tissue damage versus decreased CD4+ cell presence in determining the effectiveness of pritelivir in reducing HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest that clinical trials should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of pritelivir or similar agents in preventing HIV-1 infection in HSV-2 positive women.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gAxRWv6Wb-g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Catherine M.

These results suggest a unique and unprecedented function for a RAB effector involving the integration of two RAB groups to orchestrate endosomal trafficking in plant cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><title>Integration of two RAB5 groups during endosomal transport in plants</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34064</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d755:fc1f8953</id><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><updated>1524862800000</updated><published>1524862800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</originId><engagement>7</engagement><author><name>Unseok Lee</name></author><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Unseok Lee, Sungyul Chang, Gian Anantrio Putra, Hyoungseok Kim, Dong Hwan Kim&lt;/p&gt;
A high-throughput plant phenotyping system automatically observes and grows many plant samples. Many plant sample images are acquired by the system to determine the characteristics of the plants (populations). Stable image acquisition and processing is very important to accurately determine the characteristics. However, hardware for acquiring plant images rapidly and stably, while minimizing plant stress, is lacking. Moreover, most software cannot adequately handle large-scale plant imaging. To address these problems, we developed a new, automated, high-throughput plant phenotyping system using simple and robust hardware, and an automated plant-imaging-analysis pipeline consisting of machine-learning-based plant segmentation. Our hardware acquires images reliably and quickly and minimizes plant stress. Furthermore, the images are processed automatically. In particular, large-scale plant-image datasets can be segmented precisely using a classifier developed using a superpixel-based machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest), and variations in plant parameters (such as area) over time can be assessed using the segmented images. We performed comparative evaluations to identify an appropriate learning algorithm for our proposed system, and tested three robust learning algorithms. We developed not only an automatic analysis pipeline but also a convenient means of plant-growth analysis that provides a learning data interface and visualization of plant growth trends. Thus, our system allows end-users such as plant biologists to analyze plant growth via large-scale plant image data easily.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Unseok Lee, Sungyul Chang, Gian Anantrio Putra, Hyoungseok Kim, Dong Hwan Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Information on circulating miRNAs in frontotemporal lobar degeneration is very limited and conflicting results have complicated an interpretation in Alzheimer’s disease thus far. In the present study we I) collected samples from multiple clinical centers across Germany, II) defined 3 homogenous patient groups with high sample sizes (bvFTD n = 48, AD n = 48 and cognitively healthy controls n = 44), III) compared expression levels in both CSF and serum samples and IV) detected a limited set of miRNAs by using a MIQE compliant protocol based on SYBR-green miRCURY assays that have proven reliable to generate reproducible results. We included several quality controls that identified and reduced technical variation to increase the reliability of our data. We showed that the expression levels of circulating miRNAs measured in CSF did not correlate with levels in serum. Using cluster analysis we found expression pattern in serum that, in part, reflects the genomic organization and affiliation to a specific miRNA family and that were specifically altered in bvFTD, AD, and control groups. Applying factor analysis we identified a 3-factor model characterized by a miRNA signature that explained 80% of the variance classifying healthy controls with 97%, bvFTD with 77% and AD with 72% accuracy. MANOVA confirmed signals like miR-320a and miR-26b-5p at BH corrected significance that contributed most to discriminate bvFTD cases with 96% sensitivity and 90% specificity and AD cases with 89% sensitivity and specificity compared to healthy controls, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that miRNAs from the 3-factor model also correlated with levels of protein biomarker amyloid-beta&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, indicating their potential role in the monitoring of progressive neuronal degeneration. Our data show that miRNAs can be reproducibly measured in serum and CSF without pre-amplification and that serum includes higher expressed signals that demonstrate an overall better ability to classify bvFTD, AD and healthy controls compared to signals detected in CSF.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Johannes Denk, Felix Oberhauser, Johannes Kornhuber, Jens Wiltfang, Klaus Fassbender, Matthias L.

Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5)&lt;/i&gt; gene cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Recently we have generated &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice by targeting exon 2 on the C57BL/6N background, and demonstrated postsynaptic overaccumulation of GluN2B-containing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus. In the current study, we subjected the &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice to a battery of comprehensive behavioral tests, aiming to reveal the effects of loss of CDKL5 in a whole perspective of motor, emotional, social, and cognition/memory functions, and to identify its undetermined roles. The neurological screen, rotarod, hot plate, prepulse inhibition, light/dark transition, open field, elevated plus maze, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, one-chamber and three-chamber social interaction, 24-h home cage monitoring, contextual and cued fear conditioning, Barnes maze, and T-maze tests were applied on adult &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y and +/Y mice. &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a mild alteration in the gait. Analyses of emotional behaviors revealed significantly enhanced anxiety-like behaviors of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice. Depressive-like behaviors and social interaction of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were uniquely altered. The contextual and cued fear conditioning of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were comparable to control mice; however, &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a significantly increased freezing time and a significantly decreased distance traveled during the pretone period in the altered context. Both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory were significantly impaired. The morphometric analysis of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed impaired dendritic arborization and immature spine development in &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 plays significant roles in regulating emotional behaviors especially on anxiety- and fear-related responses, and in both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory, which suggests that focus and special attention should be paid to the specific mechanisms of these deficits in the CDKL5 deficiency disorder.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kosuke Okuda, Keizo Takao, Aya Watanabe, Tsuyoshi Miyakawa, Masashi Mizuguchi, Teruyuki Tanaka&lt;/p&gt;

These results indicate that CDKL5 plays significant roles in regulating emotional behaviors especially on anxiety- and fear-related responses, and in both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory, which suggests that focus and special attention should be paid to the specific mechanisms of these deficits in the CDKL5 deficiency disorder.</description><fingerprint>23f366a6</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Comprehensive behavioral analysis of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&amp;lt;/i&gt; knockout mice revealed significant enhancement in anxiety- and fear-related behaviors and impairment in both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196587</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33bab:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1525369184000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/476?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/476.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/476?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Normile, D.</name></author><fingerprint>7219d636</fingerprint><keywords><item>Asia/Pacific News, Science and Policy</item></keywords><unread>True</unread><title>Bucking global trends, Japan again embraces coal power</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/476?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162f8a5b82f:6a6329c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1524590032943</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1524585994000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4459.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4459</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4459.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Philipp H.

Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the “emerging” mycotoxins, which are produced by various &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1.

Newcastle disease (ND) causes severe economic loss to poultry industry worldwide. Frequent outbreaks of ND in commercial chickens vaccinated with live vaccines suggest a need to develop improved vaccines that are genetically matched against circulating Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains. In this study, the fusion protein cleavage site (FPCS) sequence of NDV strain Banjarmasin/010 (Banj), a genotype VII NDV, was individually modified using primer mutagenesis to those of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes 2, 7 and 8 and compared with the recombinant Banjarmasin (rBanj) with avirulent NDV LaSota cleavage site (rBanj-LaSota). These FPCS mutations changed the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell-to-cell fusion activity and made rBanj FPCS mutant viruses highly attenuated in chickens. When chickens immunized with the rBanj FPCS mutant viruses and challenged with the virulent Banj, there was reduced challenge virus shedding observed compared to chickens immunized with the heterologous vaccine strain LaSota. Among the genotype VII NDV Banj vaccine candidates, rBanj-LaSota and rBanj containing FPCS of APMV-8 induced highest neutralizing antibody titers and protected chickens with reduced challenge virus shedding. These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vinoth K.

These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines.</description><fingerprint>721947cc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Effect of fusion protein cleavage site sequence on generation of a genotype VII Newcastle disease virus vaccine</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197253</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395e2:3dd877af</id><engagementRate>2.61</engagementRate><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1526578752000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/689?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/689.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/689?rss=1</originId><engagement>141</engagement><author><name>Costello, T.

Fish, birds, insects and robots frequently swim or fly in groups. During their three dimensional collective motion, these agents do not stop, they avoid collisions by strong short-range repulsion, and achieve group cohesion by weak long-range attraction. In a minimal model that is isotropic, and continuous in both space and time, we demonstrate that (i) adjusting speed to a preferred value, combined with (ii) radial repulsion and an (iii) effective long-range attraction are sufficient for the stable ordering of autonomously moving agents in space. Our results imply that beyond these three rules ordering in space requires no further rules, for example, explicit velocity alignment, anisotropy of the interactions or the frequent reversal of the direction of motion, friction, elastic interactions, sticky surfaces, a viscous medium, or vertical separation that prefers interactions within horizontal layers. Noise and delays are inherent to the communication and decisions of all moving agents. Thus, next we investigate their effects on ordering in the model. First, we find that the amount of noise necessary for preventing the ordering of agents is not sufficient for destroying order. In other words, for realistic noise amplitudes the transition between order and disorder is rapid. Second, we demonstrate that ordering is more sensitive to displacements caused by delayed interactions than to uncorrelated noise (random errors). Third, we find that with changing interaction delays the ordered state disappears at roughly the same rate, whereas it emerges with different rates. In summary, we find that the model discussed here is simple enough to allow a fair understanding of the modeled phenomena, yet sufficiently detailed for the description and management of large flocks with noisy and delayed interactions.

The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities. Overall, regardless of the type, larger wetlands, with shallower waters tend to be more biodiverse. The same is true for wetlands surrounded by a higher percentage of hunting reserves and a lower density of road networks, albeit the effect of road networks was weaker. We conclude, from our results, that although the conservation value of natural wetlands is higher, artificial wetlands have the potential to play a complimentary role in the conservation of bird communities, assuming those wetlands have the right characteristics (e.g., in terms of size and depth) and assuming that the disturbances resulting from high-impact human-activities (e.g., hunting) are minimized.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Efthymia Giosa, Christos Mammides, Savvas Zotos&lt;/p&gt;

Systematics is considered important for effective toothbrushing. A theoretical concept of systematics in toothbrushing and a validated index to quantify it using observational data is suggested. The index consists of three components: completeness (all areas of the dentition reached), isochronicity (all areas brushed equally long) and consistency (avoiding frequent alternations between areas). Toothbrushing should take a sufficient length of time; therefore, this parameter is part of the index value calculation. Quantitative data from video observations were used including the number of changes between areas, number of areas reached, absolute brushing time and brushing time per area. These data were fed into two algorithms that converted the behaviour into two index values (each with values between 0 and 1) and were summed as the Toothbrushing Systematics Index (TSI) value; 0 indicates completely unsystematic and 2 indicates perfectly systematic brushing. The index was developed using theoretical data. The data matrices revealed the highest values when all areas are reached and brushed equally long. Few changes occurred between the areas when the brushing duration was ≥90 s; the lowest values occurred under opposite conditions. Clinical applicability was tested with data from re-analysed videos from an earlier intervention study aiming to establish a pre-defined toothbrushing sequence. Subjects who fully adopted this sequence had a baseline TSI of 1.30±0.26, which increased to 1.74±0.09 after the intervention (p≤0.001). When the participants who only partially adopted the sequence were included, the respective values were 1.25±0.27 and 1.69±0.14 (p≤0.001). The suggested new TS-index can cover a variety of clinically meaningful variations of systematic brushing, validly quantifies the changes in toothbrushing systematics and has discriminative power.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadine Schlueter, Katrin Winterfeld, Vicenç Quera, Tobias Winterfeld, Carolina Ganss&lt;/p&gt;

The development of farming was a catalyst for the evolution of the human diet from the varied subsistence practices of hunter-gatherers to the more globalised food economy we depend upon today. Although there has been considerable research into the dietary changes associated with the initial spread of farming, less attention has been given to how dietary choices continued to develop during subsequent millennia. A paleogenomic time transect for 5 millennia of human occupation in the Great Hungarian Plain spanning from the advent of the Neolithic to the Iron Age, showed major genomic turnovers. Here we assess where these genetic turnovers are associated with corresponding dietary shifts, by examining the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of 52 individuals. Results provide evidence that early Neolithic individuals, which were genetically characterised as Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, relied on wild resources to a greater extent than those whose genomic attributes were of typical Neolithic European farmers. Other Neolithic individuals and those from the Copper Age to Bronze Age periods relied mostly on terrestrial C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plant resources.

So far, CTSB mutations have been studied in pancreatitis and neurodegenerative disorders but little is known about the structural and functional effect of variants in CTSB. In this study, we investigated the effect of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with TCP, using molecular dynamics and simulation algorithms.

We tried to predict the effect of these variants on structure and function using multiple algorithms: SIFT, Polyphen2, Panther, SDM sever, i-Mutant2.0 suite, mCSM algorithm and Vadar. Further, using databases like miRdbSNP, PolymiRTS and miRNASNP, two SNPs in 3-UTR region were predicted to affect the miRNA binding sites. Structural mutated models of nsSNP mutants (L26V and S53G) were prepared by MODELLER v9.15 and evaluated using TM-Align, Verify 3D, ProSA and Ramachandran plot. The results showed that the models (L26V and S53G) were of high accuracy. The 3D mutated structures were simulated using GROMACS 5.0 to predict the impact of these SNPs on protein stability. The results from in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these variants in the propeptide region of cathepsin B could lead to structural and functional changes in the protein. Hence, the structural and functional analysis results have given interim conclusions that these variants can have deleterious effect in TCP and thus should be screen in samples from all TCP patients to decipher its distribution in patient population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>Tropical Calcific Pancreatitis (TCP) is a neglected juvenile form of chronic non-alcoholic pancreatitis.

Structural mutated models of nsSNP mutants (L26V and S53G) were prepared by MODELLER v9.15 and evaluated using TM-Align, Verify 3D, ProSA and Ramachandran plot. The results showed that the models (L26V and S53G) were of high accuracy. The 3D mutated structures were simulated using GROMACS 5.0 to predict the impact of these SNPs on protein stability. The results from in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these variants in the propeptide region of cathepsin B could lead to structural and functional changes in the protein. Hence, the structural and functional analysis results have given interim conclusions that these variants can have deleterious effect in TCP and thus should be screen in samples from all TCP patients to decipher its distribution in patient population.</description><fingerprint>2bfd0f77</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Structural, functional and molecular dynamics analysis of cathepsin B gene SNPs associated with tropical calcific pancreatitis, a rare disease of tropics.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to generate an ultrasonic nanobubble (NB)-mediated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/fludarabine suicide gene system for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;NBs were prepared from a mixture the phospholipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPA), perfluoropropane gas and other materials using the high shear dispersion method. NBs treated with ultrasound irradiation functioned as a gene-transfer system, and a self-constructed suicide gene expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP, treated with fludarabine functioned as a therapeutic gene. This system was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of PNP/fludarabine on HepG2 cells and SMMC7721 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1. NBs with a small diameter (208–416 nm) and at a high concentration and fine homogeneity were prepared under the optimal method. 2. The pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP plasmid was efficiently transfected into HCC cells using ultrasonic NBs. 3. At 0.75μg/ml fludarabine, PNP/fludarabine showed marked cytotoxic effects toward HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. PNP/fludarabine achieved the same effect against both SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells but at a lower concentration of fludarabine for the latter. 4. Bystander effects: a 10–20% decrease in the cell survival rate was observed when only 5–10% of transfected cells were PNP positive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;NBs constitute a non-toxic, stable and effective gene-delivery platform. The PNP/fludarabine suicide gene system inhibited the growth of HCC cells, induced HCC cell apoptosis, and caused a notable bystander effect at a low fludarabine concentration.

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by cross-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may also have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid those under co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers.

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods.

Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) catalyze the biosynthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and play an important role in many signal transduction pathways. The enzymatic activity of ACs is carefully controlled by a variety of molecules, including G-protein subunits that can both stimulate and inhibit cAMP production. Using homology models developed from existing structural data, we have carried out all-atom, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on the AC5 isoform of adenylyl cyclase and on its complexes with ATP and with the stimulatory G-protein subunit Gsα. The results show that both ATP and Gsα binding have significant effects on the structure and flexibility of adenylyl cyclase. New data on ATP bound to AC5 in the absence of Gsα notably help to explain how Gsα binding enhances enzyme activity and could aid product release. Simulations also suggest a possible coupling between ATP binding and interactions with the inhibitory G-protein subunit Gαi.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elisa Frezza, Juliette Martin, Richard Lavery&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH. Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuyuki Sato, Masaru Hatano, Yukiko Iwasaki, Hisataka Maki, Akihito Saito, Shun Minatsuki, Toshiro Inaba, Eisuke Amiya, Keishi Fujio, Masafumi Watanabe, Kazuhiko Yamamoto, Issei Komuro&lt;/p&gt;

Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH. Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>fc27df4</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Prevalence of primary Sjögren’s syndrome in patients undergoing evaluation for pulmonary arterial hypertension</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197297</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_162f7c49c2f:eec74:ae8b474d</id><crawled>1524575280175</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><published>1524456000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00522</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00522</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00522</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Isabelle J.

The protozoan &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; sp. cause diseases in humans and animals. Studies of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brucei&lt;/i&gt; cell biology have revealed unique features, such as major endocytic events being limited to a single region, and mitochondrial genome segregation mediated via basal bodies. Further understanding of trypanosome cell biology can be facilitated with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Lack of a plasma membrane probe for fixed trypanosomes remains a persistent problem in need of a working solution. Herein, we report protocols developed using mCLING in super-resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SR-SIM). mCLING comprehensively labels flagellar membranes, including nascent intracellular stages. To extend its usefulness for trypanosome biology we optimized mCLING in combination with organelle-specific antibodies for immunofluorescence of basal bodies or mitochondria. Then in work with live trypanosomes, we demonstrated internalization of mCLING into endocytic stations that overlap with LysoTracker in acidic organelles. Greater detail of the intracellular location of mCLING was obtained with SR-SIM after pulsing trypanosomes with the probe, and allowing continuous uptake of fluorescent concanavalin A (ConA) destined for lysosomes. In most cases, ConA and mCLING vesicles were juxtaposed but not coincident. A video of the complete image stack at the 15 min time point shows zones of mCLING staining surrounding patches of ConA, consistent with persistence of mCLING in membranes of compartments that contain luminal ConA. In summary, these studies establish mCLING as a versatile trypanosome membrane probe compatible with super-resolution microscopy that can be used for detailed analysis of flagellar membrane biogenesis. In addition, mCLING can be used for immunofluorescence in fixed, permeabilized trypanosomes. Its robust staining of the plasma membrane eliminates a need to overlay transmitted light images on fluorescence pictures obtained from widefield, confocal, or super-resolution microscopy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Wiedeman, Kojo Mensa-Wilmot&lt;/p&gt;

However, the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; interaction of viruses with the telomere homeostasis apparatus has not been previously explored. Since E6 and E7 are the main viral oncogenes and key for viral replication, we have explored here the short-term phenotypes of the genes in the context of defective telomere homeostasis. We examined the short-term phenotypes of E6 and E7 in a context where the Terc component of the telomerase holoenzyme was knocked out. We determined that Terc was dispensable for most oncogene-mediated phenotypes. Surprisingly, E7-mediated reduction of label retaining cells was found to be in part dependent on the presence of Terc. Under the conditions examined here, there appears to be no compelling evidence Terc is required for most short-term viral oncogene mediated phenotypes. Further studies will elucidate its role in longer-term phenotypes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charis Achilleos, Stella Michael, Katerina Strati&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of active weight loss attempts in Sweden, and to study the extent to which overweight individuals may or may not correctly identify themselves as overweight. Additional aims were to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with following a specific dietary regimen and with attempts at losing weight. A postal questionnaire was sent to 2000 randomly selected men and women living in Sweden. The inclusion criteria was an age of 20–65 years. In total, the response rate was 28% and the completed questionnaires from 555 participants were analyzed in this study. In total, 46% of participants were overweight or obese by self-reported height and weight. Additionally, 42% of overweight and 90% of obese individuals correctly identified themselves as being overweight. Weight loss was pursued by 41% and was more common among women, those with higher physical activity, higher BMI and higher socioeconomic position. Overall, 22% followed a specific diet, and following a dietary regimen was associated with female gender, higher education level and overweight. In conclusion, almost half of the participants were either overweight or trying to lose weight. Trying to lose weight and following a specific dietary regimen were related to female gender, high BMI and higher socioeconomic position. This could indicate that the socioeconomic disparities in health are further exacerbated, as overweight individuals with poor socioeconomic position might be more likely to remain overweight.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linnea Bärebring, Anna Winkvist, Hanna Augustin&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Western music is based on intervals; thus, interval discrimination is important for distinguishing the character of melodies or tracking melodies in polyphonic music. In this study the encoding of intervals in simultaneously presented sound is studied.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;In an electrophysiological experiment in 15 normal-hearing non-musicians, major thirds or fifths were presented in a controlled oddball paradigm. Harmonic intervals were created by simultaneously presented sinusoidals with randomized root frequency. Mismatch negativity (MMN) responses were measured with an EEG recording. The discrimination index was calculated in a psychoacoustic experiment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A clear MMN response was found for the major third but not for the fifth. The neural generators were located within the auditory cortices. Psychoacoustically, no evidence was found that the subjects were able to detect the deviants.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We conclude that pre-attentive discrimination of harmonic interval size is, in principle, possible in listeners without musical training although simultaneous presentation makes it harder to distinguish compared to non-overlapping intervals. Furthermore we see a difference in the response to infrequent dissonant stimuli in consonant standard stimuli compared to the opposite, rare consonant stimuli in dissonant standard stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luise Wagner, Torsten Rahne, Stefan K.

High-throughput data generation platforms, like mass-spectrometry, microarrays, and second-generation sequencing are susceptible to batch effects due to run-to-run variation in reagents, equipment, protocols, or personnel. Currently, batch correction methods are not commonly applied to microbiome sequencing datasets. In this paper, we compare different batch-correction methods applied to microbiome case-control studies. We introduce a model-free normalization procedure where features (i.e. bacterial taxa) in case samples are converted to percentiles of the equivalent features in control samples within a study prior to pooling data across studies. We look at how this percentile-normalization method compares to traditional meta-analysis methods for combining independent p-values and to limma and ComBat, widely used batch-correction models developed for RNA microarray data. Overall, we show that percentile-normalization is a simple, non-parametric approach for correcting batch effects and improving sensitivity in case-control meta-analyses.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wj8NDMeglcg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sean M.

In 2015, several provinces in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) experienced a vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak. This survey was conducted (i) to evaluate the vaccination coverage in different settings and cohorts using the seroprevalence of anti-poliovirus (PV) antibodies as a surrogate measure, and (ii) to explore the usefulness of an ELISA in a country with limited resources and a specific epidemiological setting. IgG antibodies were assessed by ELISA in Lao children (n = 1216) and adults (n = 1228), including blood donors and health care workers. Protective antibody titers against the 3 vaccine serotypes were determined by microneutralization (VNT) in a subset of participants. More than 92% of the children had anti-poliovirus antibodies, regardless of nutritional status or access to health care, highlighting the success of the vaccination outreach activities in the country. In contrast, anti-poliovirus seroprevalence reached only 81.7% in blood donors and 71.9% in health care workers. Participants born before the introduction of poliovirus vaccination in Lao PDR were considerably less likely to be seropositive. These findings align with the epidemiology of the outbreak. Neutralizing antibodies against at least one of the 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected in all children (99/99) and 93/99 had antibodies against all serotypes. Similarly, all health care workers had neutralizing antibodies against at least one and 92/99 against all serotypes. The comparison of both assays shows an acceptable underestimation of vaccine coverage in children by ELISA, but a low sensitivity of the ELISA in the adults. We show that the ELISA is a reasonable alternative to the VNT in particular in vaccinated children, that an improved version should be serotype specific, and that negativity thresholds should be revisited for optimal sensitivity and specificity. Thus, polio-free countries with an uncertain vaccination coverage and limited laboratory capacity, that are at risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks or of re-importation of wild poliovirus may benefit from an improved ELISA for cohort studies to evaluate their immunization program in children.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maude Pauly, Antony P.

Thus, polio-free countries with an uncertain vaccination coverage and limited laboratory capacity, that are at risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks or of re-importation of wild poliovirus may benefit from an improved ELISA for cohort studies to evaluate their immunization program in children.</description><fingerprint>1e68b1d1</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><title>Immunity levels to poliovirus in Lao children and adults before the vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak: A retrospective study</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197370</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_16335f68dd5:76b507:23fa95f2</id><crawled>1525618740693</crawled><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01657/20180502/images/medium/jp-2018-01657p_0010.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>258</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><published>1525579200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01657</href></item></canonical><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01657</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01657</originId><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Durba Sengupta, Xavier Prasanna, Madhura Mohole, Amitabha Chattopadhyay</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01657/20180502/images/medium/jp-2018-01657p_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01657&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
