Current 16S profiling methods, however, fail to provide sufficient taxonomic resolution and accuracy to adequately perform species-level associative studies for specific conditions. This is due to the amplification and sequencing of only short 16S rRNA gene regions, typically providing for only family- or genus-level taxonomy. Moreover, sequencing errors often inflate the number of taxa present. Pacific Biosciences&apos; (PacBio&apos;s) long-read technology in particular suffers from high error rates per base. Herein we present a microbiome analysis pipeline that takes advantage of PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) technology to sequence and error correct full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes, which provides high-fidelity species-level microbiome data. Results: Analysis of a mock community with 20 bacterial species demonstrated 100% specificity and sensitivity. Examination of a 250-plus species mock community demonstrated correct species-level classification of &gt;90% of taxa and relative abundances were accurately captured. The vast majority of the remaining taxa were demonstrated to be multiply, incorrectly, or incompletely classified making true resolution difficult. Using this methodology we examined the microgeographic variation present among the microbiomes of six sinonasal sites, by both swab and biopsy, from the anterior nasal cavity to the sphenoid sinus from 12 subjects undergoing trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. We found greater variation among subjects than among sites within a subject, although significant within-individual differences were also observed. Propiniobacterium acnes (recently renamed Cutibacterium acnes [1]) was the predominant species throughout, but was found at distinct relative abundances by site. Conclusions: Our microbial composition analysis pipeline for single-molecule real-time 16S rRNA gene sequencing (MCSMRT, https://github.com/jpearl01/mcsmrt) overcomes deficits of standard marker gene based microbiome analyses by using CCS of entire 16S rRNA genes to provide increased taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution. Extensions of this approach to other marker genes could help refine taxonomic assignments of microbial species and improve reference databases, as well as strengthen the specificity of associations between microbial communities and dysbiotic states.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163cd1ce579:4f7f6a2:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Pan-bacterial 16S rRNA microbiome surveys performed with massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies have transformed community microbiological studies.

Initially designed to identify children’s movement impairments in clinical settings, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2) is also widely used to evaluate children’s movement in research. Standardised scores on the test are calculated using parametric methods under the assumption of normally-distributed data. In a pilot study with thirty five 8–10 year old children (i.e., in Age Band 2 of the MABC-2), we found that maximal performance was often reached. These ‘ceiling effects’ created distributions of scores that may violate parametric assumptions. Tests of normality, skew, and goodness-of-fit revealed this violation, most clearly on three of the eight sub-tests. A strong deviation from normality was again observed in a sample of 161 children (8–10 years, Experiment 1), however ceiling effects were reduced by modifying the scoring methods, and administering items designed for older children when maximal performance was reached. Experiment 2 (n = 81, 7–10 years) further refined the administration and scoring methods, and again improved the distributions of scores. Despite reducing ceiling effects, scores remained non-parametrically distributed, justifying non-parametric analytic approaches. By randomly and repeatedly resampling from the raw data, we generated non-parametric reference distributions for assigning percentiles to each child’s performance, and compared the results with the standardised scores. Distributions of scores obtained with both parametric and non-parametric methods were skewed, and the methods resulted in different rankings of the same data. Overall, we demonstrate that some MABC-2 item scores are not normally-distributed, and violate parametric assumptions. Changes in administering and scoring may partially address these issues. We propose that resampling or other non-parametric methods are required to create new reference distributions to which an individual child’s performance can be referred. The modifications we propose are preliminary, but the implication is that a new standardisation is required to deal with the non-parametric data acquired with the MABC-2 performance test.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84554:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Blandine French, Nicole J.

The modifications we propose are preliminary, but the implication is that a new standardisation is required to deal with the non-parametric data acquired with the MABC-2 performance test.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197078</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197078</originId><author><name>Itaru Goto</name></author><updated>1525726800000</updated><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197078</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>c1696b10</fingerprint><published>1525726800000</published><title>Renal papillary tip extract stimulates BNP production and excretion from cardiomyocytes</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197078</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Itaru Goto, Ryuji Okamoto, Ryotaro Hashizume, Noboru Suzuki, Rie Ito, Keiichi Yamanaka, Hiromitsu Saito, Hiroshi Kiyonari, Isao Tawara, Yuki Kageyama, Yoshito Ogihara, Yusuf Ali, Norikazu Yamada, Naoyuki Katayama, Masaaki Ito&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an important biomarker for patients with cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy.

Intraperitoneal injection of the extract of the papillary tips reduced blood pressure from 210 mmHg to 165 mmHg, the decrease being accompanied by an increase in serum BNP and urinary cGMP production in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP) rats.

The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microenvironment of bacterial pathogens is often characterized by nutrient limitation. Consequently, conventional rich &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture conditions used widely to evaluate antibacterial agents are often poorly predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity, especially for agents targeting metabolic pathways. In one such pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is essential for production of isoprenoids in bacterial pathogens, relatively little is known about the influence of growth environment on antibacterial properties of inhibitors targeting enzymes in this pathway. The early steps of the MEP pathway are catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase and reductoisomerase (IspC). The in vitro antibacterial efficacy of the DXP synthase inhibitor butylacetylphosphonate (BAP) was recently reported to be strongly dependent upon growth medium, with high potency observed under nutrient limitation and exceedingly weak activity in nutrient-rich conditions. In contrast, the well-known IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has potent antibacterial activity in nutrient-rich conditions, but to date, its efficacy had not been explored under more relevant nutrient-limited conditions. The goal of this work was to thoroughly characterize the effects of BAP and fosmidomycin on bacterial cells under varied growth conditions. In this work, we show that activities of both inhibitors, alone and in combination, are strongly dependent upon growth medium, with differences in cellular uptake contributing to variance in potency of both agents. Fosmidomycin is dissimilar to BAP in that it displays relatively weaker activity in nutrient-limited compared to nutrient-rich conditions. Interestingly, while it has been generally accepted that fosmidomycin activity depends upon expression of the GlpT transporter, our results indicate for the first time that fosmidomycin can enter cells by an alternative mechanism under nutrient limitation. Finally, we show that the potency and relationship of the BAP-fosmidomycin combination also depends upon the growth medium, revealing a striking loss of BAP-fosmidomycin synergy under nutrient limitation. This change in BAP-fosmidomycin relationship suggests a shift in the metabolic and/or regulatory networks surrounding DXP accompanying the change in growth medium, the understanding of which could significantly impact targeting strategies against this pathway. More generally, our findings emphasize the importance of considering physiologically relevant growth conditions for predicting the antibacterial potential MEP pathway inhibitors and for studies of their intracellular targets.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543b:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Sanders, David Bartee, Mackenzie J.

The interplay with bacteria is of crucial importance for the interaction of multicellular organisms with their environments. Studying the associations between the nematode model organisms &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus pacificus&lt;/i&gt; with bacteria constitutes a powerful system to investigate these interactions at a mechanistic level. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt; is found in association with scarab beetles in nature and recent studies revealed the succession and dynamics of this nematode and its microbiome during the decomposition of one particular host species, the rhinoceros beetle &lt;i&gt;Oryctes borbonicus&lt;/i&gt; on La Réunion Island. However, these studies were performed using culture-free methods, with no attempt made to establish bacterial cultures from the beetle-nematode ecosystem and to investigate the effects of these microbes on life history traits in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt;.

The interplay with bacteria is of crucial importance for the interaction of multicellular organisms with their environments. Studying the associations between the nematode model organisms &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus pacificus&lt;/i&gt; with bacteria constitutes a powerful system to investigate these interactions at a mechanistic level. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt; is found in association with scarab beetles in nature and recent studies revealed the succession and dynamics of this nematode and its microbiome during the decomposition of one particular host species, the rhinoceros beetle &lt;i&gt;Oryctes borbonicus&lt;/i&gt; on La Réunion Island. However, these studies were performed using culture-free methods, with no attempt made to establish bacterial cultures from the beetle-nematode ecosystem and to investigate the effects of these microbes on life history traits in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we establish and characterize a collection of 136 bacterial strains that have been isolated from scarab beetles and figs, another &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus&lt;/i&gt;-associated environment, as a resource for studying their effect on various nematode traits. Classification based on 16S sequencing identified members of four bacterial phyla with the class of Gammaproteobacteria representing the majority with 81 strains.

Leopard seals are an important Antarctic apex predator that can affect marine ecosystems through local predation. Here we report on the successful use of micro geolocation logging sensor tags to track the movements, and activity, of four leopard seals for trips of between 142–446 days including one individual in two separate years. Whilst the sample size is small the results represent an advance in our limited knowledge of leopard seals. We show the longest periods of tracking of leopard seals’ migratory behaviour between the pack ice, close to the Antarctic continent, and the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. It appears that these tracked animals migrate in a directed manner towards Bird Island and, during their residency, use this as a central place for foraging trips as well as exploiting the local penguin and seal populations. Movements to the South Orkney Islands were also recorded, similar to those observed in other predators in the region including the krill fishery. Analysis of habitat associations, taking into account location errors, indicated the tracked seals had an affinity for shallow shelf water and regions of sea ice. Wet and dry sensors revealed that seals hauled out for between 22 and 31% of the time with maximum of 74 hours and a median of between 9 and 11 hours. The longest period a seal remained in the water was between 13 and 25 days. Fitting GAMMs showed that haul out rates changed throughout the year with the highest values occurring during the summer which has implications for visual surveys. Peak haul out occurred around midday for the months between October and April but was more evenly spread across the day between May and September. The seals’ movements between, and behaviour within, areas important to breeding populations of birds and other seals, coupled with the dynamics of the region’s fisheries, shows an understanding of leopard seal ecology is vital in the management of the Southern Ocean resources.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bbc:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Iain J.

Although it has been recognized that intestinal bacteria play an important role in the pathology of human ulcerative colitis (UC), specific pathogenic bacteria for UC have not been identified. We investigated the influence of &lt;i&gt;Paraclostridium bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 strain on the pathology of a UC mouse model and found it increased UC pathosis scores such as loose and bloody stools, reduced diversity of fecal flora, disappearance of the crypt structure of distal colon tissue, destruction of intestinal epithelial cells, and atrophy of the colon. Furthermore, we observed an increase in &lt;i&gt;COX-2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF-α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-17&lt;/i&gt; expression and a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Foxp3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; expression, as inflammation-related factors and inflammatory cytokines, a decrease in the concentration of short chain fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) in feces, and an increase of intestinal mucosal myeloperoxidase activity. These results suggest that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 is a pathology-exacerbating factor in a mouse model of UC.

Human tyrosinase (hTyr) is a Type 1 membrane bound glycoenzyme that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting steps of melanin production in the melanosome. Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;Tyr&lt;/i&gt; gene are linked to oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), an autosomal recessive disorder. Currently, the application of enzyme replacement therapy for a treatment of OCA1 is hampered by the absence of pure hTyr. Here, full-length hTyr (residues 1–529) was overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Trichoplusia ni&lt;/i&gt; larvae infected with a baculovirus, solubilized with detergent and purified using chromatography. Michaelis-Menten kinetics, enzymatic specific activity, and analytical ultracentrifugation were used to compare the hTyr in detergent with the soluble recombinant intra-melanosomal domain, hTyrC&lt;sub&gt;tr&lt;/sub&gt; (residues 19–469). Active hTyr is monomeric in detergent micelles suggesting no stable interactions between protein molecules. Both, hTyr and hTyrC&lt;sub&gt;tr&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibited similar enzymatic activity and ligand affinity in L-DOPA and L-Tyrosine reactions. In addition, expression in larvae is a scalable process that will allow high yield protein production. Thus, larval production of enzymatically active human tyrosinase potentially could be a useful tool in developing a cure for OCA1.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc5:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicole J.

The variations of relative purities or cellular composition among different BrMV samples may have significant consequences in data interpretation and research outcome, especially for experiments with high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable reference gene (RG) for accurate normalization of real-time RT-qPCR analysis, and determine the proper marker genes (MG) for relative purity assessment in BrMV samples. Out of five housekeeping genes, β-actin was selected as the most suitable RG that was validated by quantifying mRNA levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in BrMV isolated from mice with one or two expressing alleles. Four marker genes highly/selectively expressed in BBB-forming capillary endothelial cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR for purity assessment, resulting in &lt;i&gt;Cldn&lt;/i&gt;5 and &lt;i&gt;Pecam1&lt;/i&gt; as most suitable MGs that were further confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis of cellular components. &lt;i&gt;Plvap&lt;/i&gt; proved to be an indicator gene for the presence of fenestrated vessels in BrMV samples. This study may contribute to the building blocks toward overarching research needs on the blood-brain barrier.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b87:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mei Dai, Yi Lin, Salim S.

Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours. This might allow a timely administration of a suitable treatment.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8c:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Tassinari, Silvia Zannoli, Patrizia Farabegoli, Maria Federica Pedna, Anna Pierro, Antonio Mastroianni, Riccardo Fontan, Luciano Luongo, Giuseppe Sarnataro, Elisa Menegatti, Assunta Caruso, Vittorio Sambri&lt;/p&gt;

Benthic algae fuel summer food webs in many sunlit rivers, and are hotspots for primary and secondary production and biogeochemical cycling. Concerningly, riverine benthic algal assemblages can become dominated by toxic cyanobacteria, threatening water quality and public health. In the Eel River in Northern California, over a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin poisonings since 2000. During the summers of 2013–2015, we documented spatial and temporal patterns of cyanotoxin concentrations in the watershed, showing widespread distribution of anatoxin-a in benthic cyanobacterial mats. Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed weekly to record dissolved microcystin and anatoxin-a levels at 10 sites throughout the watershed, and 187 &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt;-dominated or &lt;i&gt;Phormidium-&lt;/i&gt;dominated cyanobacterial mat samples were collected from 27 locations to measure intracellular anatoxin-a (ATX) and microcystins (MCY). Anatoxin-a levels were higher than microcystin for both SPATT (mean MCY = 0.8 and ATX = 4.8 ng g resin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and cyanobacterial mat samples (mean MCY = 0.074 and ATX = 1.89 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). Of the benthic mats sampled, 58.9% had detectable anatoxin-a (max = 70.93 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), while 37.6% had detectable microcystins (max = 2.29 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). SPATT cyanotoxin levels peaked in mid-summer in warm mainstem reaches of the watershed. This is one of the first documentations of widespread anatoxin-a occurrence in benthic cyanobacterial mats in a North American watershed.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7226:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Keith Bouma-Gregson, Raphael M.

Of the benthic mats sampled, 58.9% had detectable anatoxin-a (max = 70.93 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), while 37.6% had detectable microcystins (max = 2.29 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). SPATT cyanotoxin levels peaked in mid-summer in warm mainstem reaches of the watershed. This is one of the first documentations of widespread anatoxin-a occurrence in benthic cyanobacterial mats in a North American watershed.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0030-x</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0030-x</originId><author><name>Maria Maryanovich</name></author><crawled>1525706901788</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/2ekhJMwiDYk/s41591-018-0030-x</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0030-x</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>e0acb2f4</fingerprint><published>1525676400000</published><title>Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>69</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche, Published online: 07 May 2018;

This paper presents the design and fabrication of a multi-layer and multi-chamber microchip system using thiol-ene ‘click chemistry’ aimed for drug transport studies across tissue barrier models. The fabrication process enables rapid prototyping of multi-layer microfluidic chips using different thiol-ene polymer mixtures, where porous Teflon membranes for cell monolayer growth were incorporated by masked sandwiching thiol-ene-based fluid layers. Electrodes for trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were incorporated using low-melting soldering wires in combination with platinum wires, enabling parallel real-time monitoring of barrier integrity for the eight chambers. Additionally, the translucent porous Teflon membrane enabled optical monitoring of cell monolayers. The device was developed and tested with the Caco-2 intestinal model, and compared to the conventional Transwell system. Cell monolayer differentiation was assessed via &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; immunocytochemistry of tight junction and mucus proteins, P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) mediated efflux of Rhodamine 123, and brush border aminopeptidase activity. Monolayer tightness and relevance for drug delivery research was evaluated through permeability studies of mannitol, dextran and insulin, alone or in combination with the absorption enhancer tetradecylmaltoside (TDM). The thiol-ene-based microchip material and electrodes were highly compatible with cell growth. In fact, Caco-2 cells cultured in the device displayed differentiation, mucus production, directional transport and aminopeptidase activity within 9–10 days of cell culture, indicating robust barrier formation at a faster rate than in conventional Transwell models. The cell monolayer displayed high TEER and tightness towards hydrophilic compounds, whereas co-administration of an absorption enhancer elicited TEER-decrease and increased permeability similar to the Transwell cultures. The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914f:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hsih-Yin Tan, Sofie Trier, Ulrik L.

Unpasteurized dairy products are known to occasionally harbor &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and have been implicated in recent listeriosis outbreaks and numerous sporadic cases of listeriosis. However, the diversity and virulence profiles of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from these products have not been fully described. Here we report a genomic analysis of 121 &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from milk, milk filters, and milking equipment collected from bovine dairy farms in 19 states over a 12-year period. In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks. Results of this study also demonstrate significant number of strains isolated from dairy farms encode virulence markers associated with severe human disease.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bedf:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seon Woo Kim, Julie Haendiges, Eric N.

LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks. Results of this study also demonstrate significant number of strains isolated from dairy farms encode virulence markers associated with severe human disease.</content></content></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/949?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/949?rss=1</originId><author><name>Wadman, M.</name></author><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/949?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Scientific Community</item></keywords><fingerprint>e66a1403</fingerprint><published>1527788426000</published><title>Will U.S. academies expel sexual harassers?</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/949.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>27</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d09c5:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324418v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324418v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Tsyvina, V.</name></author><crawled>1526505550090</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324418v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>2ec1bc29</fingerprint><published>1526454000000</published><title>Fast estimation of genetic relatedness between members of heterogeneous populations of closely related genomic variants [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/16/324418</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Many biological analysis tasks require extraction of families of genetically similar sequences from large datasets produced by Next-generation Sequencing (NGS).

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The pathogenic role of the lysophospholipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate and its receptor S1PR2 in lung fibrosis is unknown. We show here that genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; strikingly attenuated lung fibrosis induced by repeated injections of bleomycin in mice. We observed by using &lt;i&gt;S1pr&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice that S1PR2 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells in the lung and that S1PR2-expressing cells accumulated in the fibrotic legions. Bone marrow chimera experiments suggested that S1PR2 in bone marrow–derived cells contributes to the development of lung fibrosis. Depletion of macrophages greatly attenuated lung fibrosis. Bleomycin administration stimulated the mRNA expression of the profibrotic cytokines IL-13 and IL-4 and the M2 markers including arginase 1, Fizz1/&lt;i&gt;Retnla&lt;/i&gt;, Ccl17 and Ccl24 in cells collected from broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), and &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; deletion markedly diminished the stimulated expression of these genes. BALF cells from bleomycin–administered wild-type mice showed a marked increase in phosphorylation of STAT6, a transcription factor which is activated downstream of IL-13, compared with saline–administered wild-type mice. Interestingly, in bleomycin–administered &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, STAT6 phosphorylation in BALF cells was substantially diminished compared with wild-type mice. Finally, pharmacological S1PR2 blockade in &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice alleviated bleomycin–induced lung fibrosis. Thus, S1PR2 facilitates lung fibrosis through the mechanisms involving augmentation of IL-13 expression and its signaling in BALF cells, and represents a novel target for treating lung fibrosis.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761233:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juanjuan Zhao, Yasuo Okamoto, Yuya Asano, Kazuhiro Ishimaru, Sho Aki, Kazuaki Yoshioka, Noriko Takuwa, Takashi Wada, Yutaka Inagaki, Chiaki Takahashi, Takumi Nishiuchi, Yoh Takuwa&lt;/p&gt;

Acute post-operative pain can remain untreated if patients cannot express themselves. The perfusion index (PI) may decrease when pain activates sympathetic tone and may increase after analgesics are administered. We evaluated if the perfusion index is a feasible indicator for objectively assessing pain relief in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and calculated the changes in PI measurements at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements to examine if the PI is a useful criterion for discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit. This retrospective observational study enrolled female patients who were admitted for gynecological or general surgery. The patients received general anesthesia and were admitted to the postanesthesia care unit. The PI, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded before and after administration of intravenous morphine. Changes in these parameters before and after analgesics were administered and the difference of these parameters between age and BMI subgroups were compared. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and %ΔPI and %ΔVAS were also evaluated. The percentage change in ΔPI (P9-T0/T0) of the patients at the time of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit relative to baseline PI measurements was calculated. Eighty patients were enrolled, and there were 123 instances during which analgesia was required. Heart rate, PI, and VAS score were significantly different before and after analgesics were administered (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The difference of parameters between age and BMI subgroups were not significant. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and the percentage change in ΔPI and ΔVAS showed weak correlations in age, BMI subgroups, and all measurements. The baseline PI and the PI when arriving at and when being discharged from the postanesthesia care unit were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The mean percentage change in Δ PI at the time of discharge from the PACU was 66.2%, and the 99% confidence interval was 12.2%~120.3%. The perfusion index was increased, and the VAS score was decreased significantly after analgesics were administered, but the correlation was weak in each subgroup. The VAS score is a subjective and psychometric parameter. The PI increased when partial pain relief was achieved after morphine was administered but did not reflect pain intensity or changes in the VAS score regardless of age or BMI. A percentage change in ΔPI at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements of greater than 12% can be used as a supplemental objective discharge criterion for pain assessment in the postanesthesia care unit.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c7:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chun-Lin Chu, Yi-You Huang, Ying-Hou Chen, Ling-Ping Lai, Huei-Ming Yeh&lt;/p&gt;

A percentage change in ΔPI at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements of greater than 12% can be used as a supplemental objective discharge criterion for pain assessment in the postanesthesia care unit.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0137-8</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0137-8</originId><author><name>My-Nuong Vo</name></author><crawled>1526490145304</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0137-8</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cd616d96</fingerprint><published>1526454000000</published><title>ANKRD16 prevents neuron loss caused by an editing-defective tRNA synthetase</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>496</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANKRD16 prevents neuron loss caused by an editing-defective tRNA synthetase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANKRD16 prevents neuron loss caused by an editing-defective tRNA synthetase, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0137-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0137-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;ANKRD16 attenuates neurodegeneration induced by a mutation in the editing domain of alanyl tRNA synthetase by directly accepting mis-activated serine from the synthetase before transfer to the tRNA, establishing a new mechanism by which editing defects are prevented.</description><visual><width>1050</width><contentType>application/octet-stream</contentType><height>634</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0137-8/MediaObjects/41586_2018_137_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16369e72218:41980a7:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANKRD16 prevents neuron loss caused by an editing-defective tRNA synthetase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANKRD16 prevents neuron loss caused by an editing-defective tRNA synthetase, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0137-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0137-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;ANKRD16 attenuates neurodegeneration induced by a mutation in the editing domain of alanyl tRNA synthetase by directly accepting mis-activated serine from the synthetase before transfer to the tRNA, establishing a new mechanism by which editing defects are prevented.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05315-6</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05315-6</originId><author><name>Wolfgang Lucht</name></author><crawled>1528272651128</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05315-6</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>184b6439</fingerprint><published>1528268400000</published><title>Planting the Anthropocene’s roots in globalization</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>7</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Planting the Anthropocene’s roots in globalization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planting the Anthropocene’s roots in globalization, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05315-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05315-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Did the contested epoch begin in the seventeenth century?

Merosin deficient congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;LAMA2&lt;/i&gt; gene leading to severe and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Although over 350 causative mutations have been identified for MDC1A, no treatment is yet available. There are many therapeutic approaches in development, but the lack of natural history data of the mouse model and standardized outcome measures makes it difficult to transit these pre-clinical findings to clinical trials. Therefore, in the present study, we collected natural history data and assessed pre-clinical outcome measures for the &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model using standardized operating procedures available from the TREAT-NMD Alliance. Wild type and &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice were subjected to five different functional tests from the age of four to 32 weeks. Non-tested control groups were taken along to assess whether the functional test regime interfered with muscle pathology. Respiratory function, body weights and creatine kinase levels were recorded. Lastly, skeletal muscles were collected for further histopathological and gene expression analyses. Muscle function of &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice was severely impaired at four weeks of age and all mice lost the ability to use their hind limbs. Moreover, respiratory function was altered in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Interestingly, the respiration rate was decreased and declined with age, whereas the respiration amplitude was increased in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice when compared to wild type mice. Creatine kinase levels were comparable to wild type mice.

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42260:5785ab88</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</content></content></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5033366?af=R</link><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5033366?af=R</originId><author><name>Agnes Mahmoud</name></author><crawled>1527492817805</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5033366?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f7452356</fingerprint><published>1526960491000</published><title>The nature of the Pt(111)/[math]-Fe2O3(0001) interfaces revealed by DFT calculations</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163a5aab38d:1587644:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197817</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197817</originId><author><name>Brent Kerbel</name></author><updated>1527109200000</updated><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197817</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>7000d844</fingerprint><published>1527109200000</published><title>Xenin is a novel anorexigen in goldfish (&amp;lt;i&gt;Carassius auratus&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197817</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brent Kerbel, Kimberly Badal, Lakshminarasimhan Sundarrajan, Ayelen Blanco, Suraj Unniappan&lt;/p&gt;
Xenin, a highly conserved 25 amino acid peptide cleaved from the N-terminus of the coatomer protein alpha (COPA), is emerging as a food intake regulator in mammals and birds. To date, no research has been conducted on xenin biology in fish. This study aims to identify the &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA encoding xenin in goldfish (&lt;i&gt;Carassius auratus&lt;/i&gt;) as a model, to elucidate its regulation by feeding, and to describe the role of xenin on appetite. First, a partial sequence of &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; cDNA, a region encoding xenin, was identified from goldfish brain. This sequence is highly conserved among both vertebrates and invertebrates. RT-qPCR revealed that &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs are widely distributed in goldfish tissues, with the highest levels detected in the brain, gill, pituitary and J-loop. Immunohistochemistry confirmed also the presence of COPA peptide in the hypothalamus and enteroendocrine cells on the J-loop mucosa. In line with its anorexigenic effects, we found important periprandial fluctuations in &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, which were mainly characterized by a gradually decrease in &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels as the feeding time was approached, and a gradual increase after feeding. Additionally, fasting differently modulated the expression of &lt;i&gt;copa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in a tissue-dependent manner. Peripheral and central injections of xenin reduce food intake in goldfish. This research provides the first report of xenin in fish, and shows that this peptide is a novel anorexigen in goldfish.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2339:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Brent Kerbel, Kimberly Badal, Lakshminarasimhan Sundarrajan, Ayelen Blanco, Suraj Unniappan&lt;/p&gt;

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutants have been associated with differences in clinical and virological characteristics. Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to alter this process to survive in host cells. In this work, we studied the modulation of autophagy by the replication of HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4, and the naturally occurring mutants BCP and preCore. HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induced accumulation of autophagosomes in hepatoma cells. However, no autophagic protein degradation was observed, indicating a blockage of autophagic flux at later stages. This inhibition of autophagy flux might be due to an impairment of lysosomal acidification in hepatoma cells. Moreover, HBV-mediated autophagy modulation was independent of the viral subgenotypes and enhanced in viruses with BCP and preCore naturally occurring mutations. These results contribute to understand the mechanisms by which different HBV variants contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infections. In addition, this study is the first to describe the role that two highly prevalent naturally occurring mutations exert on the modulation of HBV-induced autophagy.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506c:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by María Mercedes Elizalde, Paula Soledad Pérez, Ina Sevic, Daniel Grasso, Alejandro Ropolo, Luciana Barbini, Rodolfo Héctor Campos, María Inés Vaccaro, Diego Martín Flichman&lt;/p&gt;

However, training complex deep neural nets requires large-scale datasets labeled with ground truth, which are often unavailable in many medical image domains. For instance, to train a deep neural net to detect pulmonary nodules in lung computed tomography (CT) images, current practice is to manually label nodule locations and sizes in many CT images to construct a sufficiently large training dataset, which is costly and difficult to scale.

Brain stimulation can modulate the activity of neural circuits impaired by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), having promising clinical benefit. However, all individuals with the same condition currently receive identical brain stimulation, with limited theoretical basis for this generic approach. In this study, we introduce a control theory framework for obtaining exogenous signals that revert pathological electroencephalographic activity in AD at a minimal energetic cost, while reflecting patients’ biological variability. We used anatomical networks obtained from diffusion magnetic resonance images acquired by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as mediators for the interaction between Duffing oscillators. The nonlinear nature of the brain dynamics is preserved, given that we extend the so-called state-dependent Riccati equation control to reflect the stimulation objective in the high-dimensional neural system. By considering nonlinearities in our model, we identified regions for which control inputs fail to correct abnormal activity. There are changes to the way stimulated regions are ranked in terms of the energetic cost of controlling the entire network, from a linear to a nonlinear approach. We also found that limbic system and basal ganglia structures constitute the top target locations for stimulation in AD. Patients with highly integrated anatomical networks–namely, networks having low average shortest path length, high global efficiency–are the most suitable candidates for the propagation of stimuli and consequent success on the control task. Other diseases associated with alterations in brain dynamics and the self-control mechanisms of the brain can be addressed through our framework.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O4eVK9xR6I0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163936302d6:62ee4f:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lazaro M.

One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7222:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Atiq Hassan, Breanna M.

This study clarifies the molecular underpinnings of the GlycA biomarker and its associated disease risk, and indicates a previously unrecognised association between elevated AAT and severe disease onset and mortality.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y</originId><author><name>Jeff Tollefson</name></author><crawled>1525832120976</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>db70005c</fingerprint><published>1525849200000</published><title>How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>44</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05123-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;International research collaborations could end in wake of US president Donald Trump&apos;s decision.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05123-y/d41586-018-05123-y_15745592.jpg</url></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16342ae7a90:76444d:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How science will suffer as US pulls out of Iran nuclear deal, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05123-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05123-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;International research collaborations could end in wake of US president Donald Trump&apos;s decision.</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00360</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00360</originId><author><name>M.

Accurate characterization of morphological variation is crucial for generating reliable results and conclusions concerning changes and differences in form. Despite the prevalence of landmark-based geometric morphometric (GM) data in the scientific literature, a formal treatment of whether sampled landmarks adequately capture shape variation has remained elusive. Here, I introduce LaSEC (Landmark Sampling Evaluation Curve), a computational tool to assess the fidelity of morphological characterization by landmarks. This task is achieved by calculating how subsampled data converge to the pattern of shape variation in the full dataset as landmark sampling is increased incrementally. While the number of landmarks needed for adequate shape variation is dependent on individual datasets, LaSEC helps the user (1) identify under- and oversampling of landmarks; (2) assess robustness of morphological characterization; and (3) determine the number of landmarks that can be removed without compromising shape information. In practice, this knowledge could reduce time and cost associated with data collection, maintain statistical power in certain analyses, and enable the incorporation of incomplete, but important, specimens to the dataset. Results based on simulated shape data also reveal general properties of landmark data, including statistical consistency where sampling additional landmarks has the tendency to asymptotically improve the accuracy of morphological characterization. As landmark-based GM data become more widely adopted, LaSEC provides a systematic approach to evaluate and refine the collection of shape data––a goal paramount for accumulation and analysis of accurate morphological information.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b788:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Akinobu Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;

The spindle pole body (SPB) plays a central role in spore plasma membrane formation in addition to its recognized role in microtubule organization. During meiosis, a biomembrane called the forespore membrane (FSM) is newly formed at the SPB. Although several SPB proteins essential for the initiation of FSM formation (meiotic SPB components) have been identified, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of Dms1 as a component of the SPB. We show that FSM formation does not initiate in &lt;i&gt;dms1Δ&lt;/i&gt; cells. Dms1 protein is constitutively expressed throughout the life cycle and localizes to the SPB and the nuclear envelope. The predicted Dms1 protein has a transmembrane domain, which is required for correct localization at the SPB. Dms1 is essential for the proper localization of three meiotic SPB components, Spo15, Spo2, and Spo13, but these components do not affect localization of Dms1. Collectively, these results suggest that Dms1 anchors these meiotic SPB components to the SPB, thereby facilitating the initiation of FSM formation.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c14:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Touko Niimi, Taro Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;
The spindle pole body (SPB) plays a central role in spore plasma membrane formation in addition to its recognized role in microtubule organization. During meiosis, a biomembrane called the forespore membrane (FSM) is newly formed at the SPB. Although several SPB proteins essential for the initiation of FSM formation (meiotic SPB components) have been identified, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of Dms1 as a component of the SPB. We show that FSM formation does not initiate in &lt;i&gt;dms1Δ&lt;/i&gt; cells. Dms1 protein is constitutively expressed throughout the life cycle and localizes to the SPB and the nuclear envelope. The predicted Dms1 protein has a transmembrane domain, which is required for correct localization at the SPB. Dms1 is essential for the proper localization of three meiotic SPB components, Spo15, Spo2, and Spo13, but these components do not affect localization of Dms1. Collectively, these results suggest that Dms1 anchors these meiotic SPB components to the SPB, thereby facilitating the initiation of FSM formation.</content></content></item><item><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35587</link><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35587</originId><author><name>chris@phy.ucsf.edu (Christoph E Schreiner)</name></author><crawled>1528199470226</crawled><description>Synchronous activity of groups of neurons is increasingly thought to be important in cortical information processing and transmission.

Although performance feedback is widely employed as a means to improve motivation, the efficacy and reliability of performance feedback is often obscured by individual differences and situational variables. The joint role of these moderating variables remains unknown. Accordingly, we investigate how the motivational impact of feedback is moderated by personality and task-difficulty. Utilizing three samples (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 916), we explore how Big Five personality traits moderate the motivational impact of false positive and negative feedback on playful, neutral, and frustrating puzzle tasks, respectively. Conscientious and Neurotic individuals together appear particularly sensitive to task difficulty, becoming significantly more motivated by negative feedback on playful tasks and demotivated by negative feedback on frustrating tasks. Results are discussed in terms of Goal-Setting and Self Determination Theory. Implications for industry and education are considered.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406e:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Victor Swift, Jordan B.

Earlier studies on a recombinant xylanase from Bacillus sp. NG-27 (RBSX), which has the ubiquitous (beta/alpha)8-triosephosphate isomerase barrel fold showed that three aromatic residues to alanine substitutions, in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, significantly decreased the stability of the enzyme. Of these mutations, F4A mutation decreased the stability of the enzyme by ~4 degree C, whereas W6A mutation and Y343A mutation remarkably decreased the stability of the enzyme by ~10 degree C. On the other hand, the F4W mutation did not affect the thermal stability of RBSX. We provide here a network perspective of aromatic-aromatic interactions in terms of aromatic clique community and long-range association. Our study reveals that disruption of long-range k-clique aromatic interaction cluster holding the N- and C-terminal regions are associated with the decreased stability of the enzyme. The present work reiterates as well as expands on those findings concerning the role of interactions between the N- and C-terminus in protein stability. Furthermore, comparative analyses of crystal structures of homologous pairs of proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms emphasize the prevalence of long-range k-clique communities of aromatic interaction that may be playing an important role and highlights an additional source of stability in thermophilic proteins. The design principle based on clustering of long-range aromatic residues in the form of aromatic-clique and clique community may be effectively applied to enhance the stability of enzymes for biotechnological applications.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163a7819991:185fc93:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Aromatic interactions make an important contribution to protein structure, function, folding and have attracted intense study.

The design principle based on clustering of long-range aromatic residues in the form of aromatic-clique and clique community may be effectively applied to enhance the stability of enzymes for biotechnological applications.</content></content></item><item><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Antimicrobial_Chitosan-G-poly_AMPS-Co-AA-Co-AM_Ground_Basalt_Composite_Hydrogel_Synthesis_and_Characterization/6233393</link><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Antimicrobial_Chitosan-G-poly_AMPS-Co-AA-Co-AM_Ground_Basalt_Composite_Hydrogel_Synthesis_and_Characterization/6233393</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1525873808489</crawled><description>This paper presents for the first time the introduction of ground basalt into the network of a chitosan based hydrogel and the enhancement of the bactericidal activity of the hydrogel.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Antimicrobial_Chitosan-G-poly_AMPS-Co-AA-Co-AM_Ground_Basalt_Composite_Hydrogel_Synthesis_and_Characterization/6233393</href></item></alternate><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>5c721bb4</fingerprint><published>1525824000000</published><title>Antimicrobial Chitosan-G-poly(AMPS-Co-AA-Co-AM)/Ground Basalt Composite Hydrogel: Synthesis and Characterization</title><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>This paper presents for the first time the introduction of ground basalt into the network of a chitosan based hydrogel and the enhancement of the bactericidal activity of the hydrogel.</content></summary><visual><width>250</width><contentType>image/png</contentType><height>354</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-chemrxiv-7984736271254/11399714/thumb.png</url></visual><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163452a9469:b5908e:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25615-1</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25615-1</originId><author><name>Marie Brossard-Racine</name></author><crawled>1526941276364</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/NcmWudnZgjY/s41598-018-25615-1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25615-1</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>d85a1ff8</fingerprint><published>1526972400000</published><title>Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely, Published online: 22 May 2018;

To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains.

American Indians (AI) have high prevalence of diabetes in youth and may benefit from increasing physical activity as a strategy to improve metabolic health. We tested whether financial incentives would elicit greater frequency and/or duration of exercise in AI youth at high risk for developing diabetes. Overweight/obese AI boys and girls, 11–20 years old, were instructed to exercise on 3 days/week for 48 weeks at a tribal wellness center. The program was divided into three, 16-week-long phases to test different financial incentive strategies. Within each phase participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups that received different payments for exercise. Phase 1 was designed to test whether the size of the incentive would affect exercise frequency. In Phase 1, the number of exercise sessions did not differ between the group receiving a modest fixed-value payment per exercise session and the group receiving enhanced incentives to exercise more frequently (26 ± 3 versus 28 ± 2 sessions, respectively, p = 0.568). In Phase 2, the provision of an enhanced financial incentive to increase exercise duration resulted longer sessions, as the incentivized and standard payment groups exercised 38 ± 2 versus 29 ± 1 minutes per session (p = 0.002), respectively. In Phase 3, the effect of reducing the incentives on maintenance of exercise behaviors was inconclusive due to high participant withdrawal. Aerobic fitness increased 10% during Phase 1 but was unchanged thereafter. Insulin sensitivity and body composition were unchanged during the study. In conclusion, enhanced financial incentives increased the duration of exercise sessions, but had minimal effects on exercise participation. These results indicate that financial incentives hold promise in motivating previously sedentary, overweight/obese adolescents to exercise longer, but motivating them to sustain an exercise program remains the major challenge.

Pathogen load determines the outcome of many infections, and is a consequence of pathogen multiplication rate, duration of the infection, and inhibition or killing of pathogen by the host (resistance). If these determinants of pathogen load could be quantified then their mechanistic correlates might be determined. In humans the timing of infection is rarely known and treatment cannot usually be withheld to monitor serial changes in pathogen load and host response. Here we present an approach to overcome this and identify potential mechanisms of resistance which control parasite load in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Using a mathematical model of longitudinal infection dynamics for orientation, we made individualized estimates of parasite multiplication and growth inhibition in Gambian children at presentation with acute malaria and used whole blood RNA-sequencing to identify their correlates. We identified novel roles for secreted proteases cathepsin G and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) as direct effector molecules which inhibit P. falciparum growth. Cathepsin G acts on the erythrocyte membrane, cleaving surface receptors required for parasite invasion, whilst MMP9 acts on the parasite. In contrast, the type 1 interferon response and expression of CXCL10 (IFN-{gamma}-inducible protein of 10 kDa, IP-10) were detrimental to control of parasite growth. Natural variation in iron status and plasma levels of complement factor H were determinants of parasite multiplication rate. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for the dynamic interaction between host and pathogen when seeking to identify correlates of protection, and reveal novel mechanisms controlling parasite growth in humans. This approach could be extended to identify additional mechanistic correlates of natural- and vaccine-induced immunity to malaria and other infections.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1636478e11d:3887d41:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Improved methods are needed to identify host mechanisms which directly protect against human infectious diseases in order to develop better vaccines and therapeutics.

In mammals, the liver and kidney play central roles in protecting the organism from xenobiotics, and are at high risk of xenobiotic-induced injury. Liver and kidney damage by drugs and industrial toxins have been extensively studied from both classical histopathologic and biochemical perspectives. Methods and Findings: We introduce a machine learning approach for the analysis of toxicological response. Unsupervised characterization of physiological and histological changes in a large toxicogenomic dataset revealed nine discrete toxin-induced disease states. Transcriptome analysis showed that some of the machine-identified disease states correspond to known pathology, and to known effects of certain toxin classes, but others were novel. Analysis of dynamics revealed transitions between disease states at constant toxin exposure, mostly in the direction of decreased pathology, which implies induction of tolerance. Tolerance correlated with induction of known xenobiotic defense genes and novel decreased ferroptosis sensitivity biomarkers. These data reinforce emerging evidence that ferroptosis drives organ pathology, and suggest that its downreagulation may promote tolerance and recovery. Lastly, mechanism of body weight decrease, a known primary marker for toxicity, was investigated. Combined analysis of food consumption, body weight, and molecular biomarkers indicated that organ disease states promote cachexia by whole-body signaling through Gdf15 and Igf1, suggesting strategies for therapeutic intervention that may be broadly relevant to human disease. Conclusions: Application of machine learning to systematic data collection of physiology, histopathology, transcriptome reveals multiple disease states, tolerance mechanisms and organ to whole-body communication.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163a9032618:1a7f704:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Living organisms are constantly exposed to toxic xenobiotics and have therefore evolved protective responses.

Glioblastoma is a primary brain tumor with a poor prognosis despite of many treatment regimens. Radiotherapy significantly prolongs patient survival and remains the most common treatment. Slit2 and Robo1 are evolutionarily conserved proteins involved in axon guidance, migration, and branching of neuronal cells. New studies have shown that Slit2 and Robo1 could play important roles in leukocyte chemotaxis and glioblastoma cell migration. Therefore, we investigated whether the Slit2/Robo1 complex has an impact on the motility of glioblastoma cells and whether irradiation with therapeutic doses modulates this effect. Our results indicate that photon irradiation increases the migration of glioblastoma cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. qPCR and immunoblotting experiments in two different glioblastoma cell lines (U-373 MG and U-87 MG) with different malignancy revealed that both Slit2 and Robo1 are significantly lower expressed in the cell populations with the highest motility and that the expression was reduced after irradiation. Overexpression of Robo1 significantly decreased the motility of glioblastoma cells and inhibited the accelerated migration of wild-type cells after irradiation. Immunoblotting analysis of migration-associated proteins (fascin and focal adhesion kinase) and of the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition-related protein vimentin showed that irradiation affected the migration of glioblastoma cells by increasing vimentin expression, which can be reversed by the overexpression of Slit2 and Robo1. Our findings suggest that Robo1 expression might counteract migration and also radiation-induced migration of glioblastoma cells, a process that might be connected to mesenchymal-epithelial transition.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b792:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pascaline Nguemgo Kouam, Günther A.

The evaluation of protected area networks on their capacity to preserve species distributions is a key topic in conservation biology. There are different types of protected areas, with National Parks those with highest level of protection. National Parks can be declared attending to many ecological features that include the presence of certain animal species. Here, we selected 37 vertebrate species that were highlighted as having relevant natural value for at least one of the 10 National Parks of mainland Spain. We modelled species distributions with the favourability function, and applied the Insecurity Index to detect the degree of protection of favourable areas for each species. Two metrics of Insecurity Index were defined for each species: the Insecurity Index in each of the cells, and the Overall Insecurity Index of a species. The former allows the identification of insecure areas for each species that can be used to establish spatial conservation priorities. The latter gives a value of Insecurity for each species, which we used to calculate the Representativeness of favourable areas for the species in the network. As expected, due to the limited extension of the National Park network, all species have high values of Insecurity; i.e., just a narrow proportion of their favourable areas are covered by a National Park. However, the majority of species favourable areas are well represented in the network, i.e., the percentage of favourable areas covered by the National Park network is higher than the percentage of mainland Spain covered by the network (result also supported by a randomization approach). Even if a reserve network only covers a low percentage of a country, the Overall Insecurity Index allows an objective assessment of its capacity to represent species. Beyond the results presented here, the Insecurity Index has the potential to be extrapolated to other areas and to cover a wide range of species.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122b:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alba Estrada, Raimundo Real&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Modifiable risk factors such as smoking and sedentary lifestyle adversely affect multiple sclerosis (MS) progression. Few multimodal behavioural interventions have been conducted for people with MS, and follow-up beyond 1 year is rare for lifestyle interventions. This study assessed adoption and adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviours and health outcomes 3 years after a lifestyle modification intervention, using generalized estimating equation models to account for within-participant correlation over time.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;95 people with MS completed baseline surveys before participating in 5-day MS lifestyle risk-factor modification workshops. 76 and 78 participants completed the 1-year and 3-year follow-up surveys respectively. Mean age at 3-year follow-up was 47 years, 72% were female, most (62.8%) had MS for 5 years or less, and 73% had relapsing remitting MS (RRMS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to baseline, participants reported clinically meaningful increases in physical (mean difference (MD): 8.0, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 5.2–10.8) and mental health (MD: 9.2, CI: 5.8–12.6) quality of life (QOL) at 1-year, and physical (MD: 8.7, CI: 5.3–12.2) and mental health (MD: 8.0, CI: 4.2–11.8) QOL at 3-year follow-up. There was a small decrease in disability from baseline to 1-year follow-up (MD: 0.9, CI: 0.9,1.0) and to 3-year follow-up (MD: 1.0, CI: 0.9,1.0), which was not clinically meaningful. Of those with RRMS, compared to baseline, fewer had a relapse during the year before 1-year follow-up (OR: 0.1, CI 0.0–0.2) and 3-year follow-up (OR: 0.15, CI 0.06–0.33). Participants’ healthy diet score, the proportion meditating ≥1 hours a week, supplementing with ≥ 5000IU vitamin D daily, and supplementing with omega-3 flaxseed oil increased at 1-year follow-up and was sustained, although slightly lower at 3-year follow-up. However, there was no evidence for a change in physical activity and not enough smokers to make meaningful comparisons. Medication use increased at 1-year follow-up and at 3-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results provide evidence that lifestyle risk factor modification is feasible and sustainable over time, in a small self-selected and motivated sample of people with MS. Furthermore, participation in a lifestyle intervention is not associated with a decrease in MS medication use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2337:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Claudia H.

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is generally considered as a mild exanthematous disease to infants and young children worldwide. HFMD cases are usually mild and self-limiting but for few cases leads to complicated severe clinical outcomes, and even death. Previous studies have indicated that serum Ang II levels in patients with H7N9 infection were related to the severity of infection. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe HFMD remain unclear. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the progression of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the present study, 162 children including HFMD patients and healthy controls were recruited. The data was analyzed by time-series fashion. Concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) and noradrenaline (NA) in serum of patients were measured with ELISA. We established a mouse model for enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and determined concentrations of Ang II, NA in tissue lysates at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of the HFMD patients with mild or severe symptoms were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Additionally, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of severe cases were significantly higher than those mild cases and the increased concentrations of Ang II and NA showed the same time trend during the progression of HFMD in the severe cases. Furthermore, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in target organs of EV71-infected mice including brains, skeletal muscle, and lungs were increased with the progression of EV71 infection in mice. Histopathological alterations were observed in the brains, skeletal muscle and lungs of EV71-infected mice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study suggested that activation of the RAS is implicated in the pathogenesis of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f233c:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Zhang, Shuaiyin Chen, Guangyuan Zhou, Yuefei Jin, Rongguang Zhang, Haiyan Yang, Yuanlin Xi, Jingchao Ren, Guangcai Duan&lt;/p&gt;

This study was undertaken to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the progression of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the present study, 162 children including HFMD patients and healthy controls were recruited. The data was analyzed by time-series fashion. Concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) and noradrenaline (NA) in serum of patients were measured with ELISA. We established a mouse model for enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and determined concentrations of Ang II, NA in tissue lysates at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of the HFMD patients with mild or severe symptoms were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Additionally, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of severe cases were significantly higher than those mild cases and the increased concentrations of Ang II and NA showed the same time trend during the progression of HFMD in the severe cases. Furthermore, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in target organs of EV71-infected mice including brains, skeletal muscle, and lungs were increased with the progression of EV71 infection in mice. Histopathological alterations were observed in the brains, skeletal muscle and lungs of EV71-infected mice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study suggested that activation of the RAS is implicated in the pathogenesis of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197822</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197822</originId><author><name>Elizabeth R.

Fitness is determined by the ability of an organism to both survive and reproduce; however, the mechanisms that lead to increased survival may not have the same effect on reproductive success. We used nineteen natural &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; genotypes from the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Genetic Reference Panel to determine if adaptive plasticity following short-term acclimation through rapid cold-hardening (RCH) affects mating behavior and mating success. We confirmed that exposure to the acclimation temperature is beneficial to survival following cold stress; however, we found that this same acclimation temperature exposure led to less efficient male courtship and a significant decrease in the likelihood of mating. Cold tolerance and the capacity to respond plastically to cold stress were not correlated with mating behavior following acclimation, suggesting that the genetic control of the physiological effects of the cold temperature exposure likely differ between survival and behavioral responses. We also tested whether the exposure of males to the acclimation temperature influenced courtship song. This exposure again significantly increased courtship duration; however, courtship song was unchanged. These results illustrate costs of short-term acclimation on survival and reproductive components of fitness and demonstrate the pronounced effect that short-term thermal environment shifts can have on reproductive success.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f233a:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth R.

Background and objective &lt;p&gt;The distribution of body fat is closely related to cardiovascular disease and outcomes, although its impact on patient prognosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) has not been evaluated. We investigated the impact of truncal fat distribution on long-term clinical outcomes after DES treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 441 DES-treated patients, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed to assess total and regional body fat distribution after index PCI. The ratio of truncal fat to total body fat mass (%FM&lt;sub&gt;trunk&lt;/sub&gt;/FM&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;) was calculated as a representative parameter for truncal fat distribution. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite of ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), non-procedural myocardial infarction, cardiac death at 5 years.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the median follow-up duration of 1780 days, MACE occurred in 22.0% of patients, with the highest-quartile group of %FM&lt;sub&gt;trunk&lt;/sub&gt;/FM&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; having a higher rate than the lowest quartile group (27.8% vs. 15.3%; log rank &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.026). The difference was driven by a higher rate of ischemia-driven TVR (25.9% vs. 9.9%; log rank &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008).

Background &lt;p&gt;Activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an attractive approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. AMPK activation reduces glucose levels in animal models of type 2 diabetes by increasing glucose uptake in skeletal muscles and reducing hepatic glucose production. Furthermore, AMPK activation ameliorates hepatic steatosis in animal models. For the clinical development of AMPK activators it is essential to have a reliable target engagement marker for appropriate dose finding and to support proof of clinical principle. While the activation of AMPK by quantification of the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; in target tissues can be assessed pre-clinically, this is not feasible in clinical studies. Therefore, we attempted to identify and translate a peripheral target engagement biomarker downstream of AMPK activation for clinical use in blood samples.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;For pharmacological activation of AMPK, two AMPK activators were synthesized (compound 1 and 2). A compound with structural similarities but no pharmacological effect on AMPK phosphorylation was synthesized as negative control (compound 3). Whole blood from healthy volunteers was incubated with an AMPK activator for up to 6 hours and mRNA sequencing was performed. Additionally, human PBMCs were isolated to evaluate Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in Western blots. In order to enable identification of translatable biomarker candidates, blood samples from HanWistar rats treated for two weeks with an AMPK activator were also subjected to mRNA sequencing. Furthermore, concentration-response curves for four biomarker candidates were recorded in human blood samples using Nanostring nCounter technology. Finally, ZDF rats were treated with increasing doses of compound 2 for five weeks to investigate the glucose-lowering efficacy. To investigate changes of mRNA expression of two selected biomarker candidates in this ZDF rat study, qRT-PCR was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Pharmacological activation of AMPK in human PBMCs revealed an increase in Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK, confirming target engagement in these blood cells. RNA sequencing of human blood samples identified 608 deregulated genes after AMPK activation. Additionally, AMPK activation led to deregulation of 367 genes in whole blood from HanWistar rats which mapped to the respective human genes. 22 genes out of the intersection of genes deregulated in both species are proposed as potential translatable target engagement biomarker candidates. The most prominent genes were transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB, osteoactivin), calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGLYRP1) and Ras homolog gene family, member B (RHOB). Specificity for AMPK was shown by testing inactive compound 3 in HanWistar rats. The exposure-effect relationship for GPNMB was investigated in a subchronic study in diabetic ZDF rats. GPNMB showed a dose-dependent up-regulation both acutely and after subchronic dosing. GPNMB up-regulation correlated with an increased Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in liver and quadriceps muscle in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;GPNMB has been identified as a translatable target engagement biomarker for use in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd78:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rolf Grempler, Michael Wolff, Eric Simon, Ramona Schmid, Claudia Eisele, Kathrin Rieber, Elke Fischer, Sonja Mettel, Ogsen Gabrielyan, Denis Delic, Gerd Luippold, Norbert Redeman&lt;/p&gt;

GPNMB up-regulation correlated with an increased Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in liver and quadriceps muscle in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;GPNMB has been identified as a translatable target engagement biomarker for use in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-i?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-i?rss=1</originId><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-i?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><fingerprint>f2e24ce4</fingerprint><published>1525974002000</published><title>H-bond to deliver fluoride</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.9.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7da:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-c?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-c?rss=1</originId><author><name>Grocholski, B.</name></author><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-c?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Physics, Applied, Materials Science</item></keywords><fingerprint>3f850000</fingerprint><published>1526578752000</published><title>SnSe doped a different way</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/748.3.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395c4:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25625-z</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25625-z</originId><author><name>Yanyan Liu</name></author><crawled>1527059812886</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/G06IFxlwG_E/s41598-018-25625-z</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25625-z</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>58903e7f</fingerprint><published>1527058800000</published><title>Publisher Correction: Emergence of Different Recombinant Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Viruses, China</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Emergence of Different Recombinant Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Viruses, China&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Emergence of Different Recombinant Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Viruses, China, Published online: 23 May 2018;

The rate at which an element in a metabolic network accumulates genetic variation via new mutations depends on both the size of the mutational target it presents and its robustness to mutational perturbation. Quantifying the relationship between topological properties of network elements and the mutability of those elements will facilitate understanding the variation in and evolution of networks at the level of populations and higher taxa. We report an investigation into the relationship between two topological properties of 29 metabolites in the C. elegans metabolic network and the sensitivity of those metabolites to the cumulative effects of spontaneous mutation. The correlations between measures of network centrality and mutability are not statistically significant, but several trends point toward a weak positive association between network centrality and mutational sensitivity. There is a small but significant negative association between the mutational correlation of a pair of metabolites (rM) and the shortest path length between those metabolites. Positive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto. The weakness of the correlation between rM and the shortest path length between pairs of metabolites suggests that network locality is an important but not overwhelming factor governing mutational pleiotropy. These findings provide necessary background against which the effects of other evolutionary forces, most importantly natural selection, can be interpreted.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163a8950771:19f4946:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>A fundamental issue in evolutionary systems biology is understanding the relationship between the topological architecture of a biological network, such as a metabolic network, and the evolution of the network.

There is a small but significant negative association between the mutational correlation of a pair of metabolites (rM) and the shortest path length between those metabolites. Positive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto. The weakness of the correlation between rM and the shortest path length between pairs of metabolites suggests that network locality is an important but not overwhelming factor governing mutational pleiotropy. These findings provide necessary background against which the effects of other evolutionary forces, most importantly natural selection, can be interpreted.</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00316</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00316</originId><author><name>Abner A.

End-stage renal disease is strongly associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification (CVC) and there is currently no therapy targeted to treat CVC. SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee0:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel D.

The ability to arrange thoughts and actions in an appropriate serial order (the problem of serial order) is essential to complex behaviors such as language, reasoning and cognitive planning. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1–2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA≥26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21≤MoCA≤25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test.

The ability to arrange thoughts and actions in an appropriate serial order (the problem of serial order) is essential to complex behaviors such as language, reasoning and cognitive planning. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1–2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA≥26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21≤MoCA≤25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test. The ordering cost increased as a function of age across groups, indicating an aging-related decline in the ability of serial ordering. However, individual patients’ task performances were not correlated with their severity or duration of motor symptoms, or daily exposure to dopaminergic drugs. These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms.</content></content></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5253.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5253.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1527620470952</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5253.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>23c93f43</fingerprint><published>1527617175000</published><title>Correction for Woo et al., Control of motor coordination by astrocytic tonic GABA release through modulation of excitation/inhibition balance in cerebellum [Correction]</title><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5253</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>NEUROSCIENCE Correction for “Control of motor coordination by astrocytic tonic GABA release through modulation of excitation/inhibition balance in cerebellum,” by Junsung Woo, Joo Ok Min, Dae-Si Kang, Yoo Sung Kim, Guk Hwa Jung, Hyun Jung Park, Sunpil Kim, Heeyoung An, Jea Known, Jeongyeon Kim, Insop Shim, Hyung-Gun Kim, C.

Biological systems can share and collectively process information to yield emergent effects, despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must reliably flow into the rest of the population. We study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task. We present an impossibility result which strongly restricts reliable rumor spreading in such groups. Namely, we prove that, in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources—a process which requires linear time in the population size. Our results imply that in order to achieve efficient rumor spread a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or, alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise. We then corroborate this claim by providing new analyses of experimental data regarding recruitment in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis niger&lt;/i&gt; desert ants. Finally, in light of our theoretical results, we discuss strategies to overcome noise in other biological systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-ijtk1KgGA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163d63ebdc4:1bc492d:a96d255</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucas Boczkowski, Emanuele Natale, Ofer Feinerman, Amos Korman&lt;/p&gt;

The identification of germplasm resources is an important aspect of sugarcane breeding. The aim of this study was to introduce a new method for identifying &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny. First, we cloned and sequenced nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrDNA-ITS) sequences from 20 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms. Analysis of these nrDNA-ITS sequences showed a stable mutation at base 89. Primers (FO13, RO13, FI16, and RI16) were then designed for tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR based on mutations at base 89 of the nrDNA-ITS sequence. An additional 71 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms were identified using this tetra-primer ARMS PCR method, which confirmed that the method using the described primers successfully identified &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and progeny. These results may help improve the efficiency of modern molecular breeding of sugarcane and lay a foundation for identification of sugarcane germplasms and the relationships among them.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b9:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shan Yang, Xueting Li, Fei Huang, Yongji Huang, Xinlong Liu, Jiayun Wu, Qinnan Wang, Zuhu Deng, Rukai Chen, Muqing Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The challenges of detecting a BSJ from short read high throughput sequencing (HTS) data has steered software development to focus primarily on algorithmic methods to accurately capture BSJs. Here we present Ularcirc, the first software tool that provides a complete circRNA workflow from detection, integrated visualization, quality filtering of BSJ and forward splicing junctions (FSJ), through to sequence retrieval and downstream functional analysis. More importantly, Ularcirc uses an innovative method to filter out false positive circRNAs coined read alignment distribution (RAD) score which allows detection of circRNAs independent of gene annotations. We used Ularcirc to characterise circRNAs from public and in-house generated data sets and demonstrate how to discover (i) novel splicing patterns of parental transcripts, (ii) internal splicing patterns of circRNA, and (iii) the complexity of BSJ formation. Furthermore, we identify circRNAs that have potential open reading frames longer than their linear sequence. Finally, we have identified and validated the presence of a novel class of circRNA generated from ApoA4 transcripts whose BSJ derive from multiple sites within coding exons. Ularcirc can be accessed via https://github.com/VCCRI/Ularcirc.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163647150a9:3944afc:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique class of transcripts that can only be identified from sequence alignments spanning discordant junctions, commonly referred to as backsplice junctions (BSJ).

However, cell size often fluctuates significantly from cell to cell and from generation to generation. Here we present a unified framework to predict the statistics of cell size variations within a lineage tree of a proliferating population.

Background &lt;p&gt;Crime and violence causes massive disruptions to the health, survival and development of populations. In South Africa, incredibly high rates of crime and violence are noted. The country also has a very large youth population whose health, survival and development are key to economic growth. Among other efforts to encourage healthy youth development and the promotion of social activities such as sports, youth groups, choirs and so forth. This study examines the relationship between perceived community safety and the uptake of social activities among youth in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Data and methods &lt;p&gt;This paper uses data from the National Youth Lifestyle Survey (2008) with an unweighted sample of 4,391 youth (age12-22 years old). Using chi-square and logistic regression analysis the association between perceived community safety and social activity participation are tested.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that youth participation in social activities in South Africa is high (55% of males and 45% of females). Among males, the most prominent activity is sports (51.8%), while for females there is high participation in choir and singing groups (55.68%). More than 50% of males perceive their communities as risky while less than half of females feel the same. Male youth are more likely to participate in social activities if they perceive their communities as risky (OR = 1.04). Females (OR = 0.83), youth have a negative view of their future (OR = 0.43) are less likely to participate in social activities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There exists an association between youth’s perception of community safety and their participation in social activities. Whether sports and groups are protective or enabling environments for youth from unsafe communities is moot. More in-depth research is needed on why youth participate in these clubs and groups to truly understand the role of social activities in South African societies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7223:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicole De Wet, Oluwaseyi Somefun, Ndivhuwo Rambau&lt;/p&gt;

It occurs when an individual has a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21. This chromosome trisomy results in the overexpression of genes that is believed to be sufficient to interfere normal pathways and normal responses to stimulation, causing learning and memory deficiency. Therefore, by studying these proteins and the disturbance in pathways that are involved in learning and memory, we can consider drugs that would correct the observed perturbations, and therefore assist in enhancing the memory and learning. Here, from genes based on an earlier study that identified 77 proteins differentially expressed in normal and trisomic wild mice exposed to context fear conditioning (CFC), we provide a quantitative protein selection based on different feature selection techniques to select the most important proteins related to learning and memory. These techniques include Fisher score, Chi score, and correlation-based subset. In addition, a deep feature selection is utilized to extract high order proteins using deep neural networks. Three main experiments are carried out:studying the control mice&apos;s response, studying the trisomy mice&apos;s response, and studying the control-trisomy mice&apos;s response. In each experiment, support vector machine classifier is used to assess these selected proteins ability to distinguish between learned and not-learned mice to the fear conditioning event. By applying the deep feature selection, fifteen proteins were selected in control mice, nine in trisomy mice, and seven in control-trisomy mice achieving distinguishing accuracies of 93%, 99%, 84% respectively compared to 74%, 78%, and 71% average accuracies of other selection methods.

Success rates for catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation patients are currently low; however, there is a subset of patients for whom electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins alone is a successful treatment strategy. It is difficult to identify these patients because there are a multitude of factors affecting arrhythmia susceptibility and maintenance, and the individual contributions of these factors are difficult to determine clinically. We hypothesised that the combination of pulmonary vein (PV) electrophysiology and atrial body fibrosis determine driver location and effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We used bilayer biatrial computer models based on patient geometries to investigate the effects of PV properties and atrial fibrosis on arrhythmia inducibility, maintenance mechanisms, and the outcome of PVI. Short PV action potential duration (APD) increased arrhythmia susceptibility, while longer PV APD was found to be protective. Arrhythmia inducibility increased with slower conduction velocity (CV) at the LA/PV junction, but not for cases with homogeneous CV changes or slower CV at the distal PV. Phase singularity (PS) density in the PV region for cases with PV fibrosis was increased. Arrhythmia dynamics depend on both PV properties and fibrosis distribution, varying from meandering rotors to PV reentry (in cases with baseline or long APD), to stable rotors at regions of high fibrosis density. Measurement of fibrosis and PV properties may indicate patient specific susceptibility to AF initiation and maintenance. PV PS density before PVI was higher for cases in which AF terminated or converted to a macroreentry; thus, high PV PS density may indicate likelihood of PVI success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rn0Tfj7bu6A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163934cbc78:66798:d63e3ae2</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Caroline H.

The rise of ontology-based data representation in biology has also led to the development of several semantic similarity metrics that use different statistics to estimate similarity. Although semantic similarity has become a crucial computational tool in several applications, there has not been a formal evaluation of the statistical sensitivity of these metrics and their ability to recognize similarity between distantly related biological objects. Here, we present a statistical sensitivity comparison of five semantic similarity metrics (Jaccard, Resnik, Lin, Jiang &amp;amp; Conrath, and Hybrid Relative Specificity Similarity) representing three different kinds of metrics (Edge based, Node based, and Hybrid) and explore key parameter choices that can impact sensitivity. Furthermore, we compare four methods of aggregating individual annotation similarities to estimate similarity between two biological objects - All Pairs, Best Pairs, Best Pairs Symmetric, and Groupwise. To evaluate sensitivity in a controlled fashion, we explore two different models for simulating data with varying levels of similarity and compare to the noise distribution using resampling. Source data are derived from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase of evolutionary phenotypes. Our results indicate that the choice of similarity metric along with different parameter choices can substantially affect sensitivity. Among the five metrics evaluated, we find that Resnik similarity shows the greatest sensitivity to weak semantic similarity. Among the ways to combine pairwise statistics, the Groupwise approach provides the greatest discrimination among values above the sensitivity threshold, while the Best Pairs statistic can be parametrically tuned to provide the highest sensitivity. Our findings serve as a guideline for an appropriate choice and parameterization of semantic similarity metrics, and point to the need for improved reporting of the statistical significance of semantic similarity matches in cases where weak similarity is of interest.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163884a5d0d:6bbd3ed:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Semantic similarity has been used for comparing genes, proteins, phenotypes, diseases, etc. for various biological applications.

Várzea forests account for 17% of the Amazon basin and endure an annual inundation that can reach 14 m deep during 6–8 months. This flood pulse in combination with topography directly influences the várzea vegetation cover. Assemblages of several taxa differ significantly between unflooded &lt;i&gt;terra firme&lt;/i&gt; and flooded várzea forests, but little is known about the distribution of medium and large sized terrestrial mammals in várzea habitats. Therefore, our goal was to understand how those habitats influence mammalian species distribution during the dry season. Specifically, we: (1) compared the species composition between a terra firme (Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve) and a várzea forest (Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve); and (2) tested the influence of the várzea habitat classes on the number of records, occurrence and species composition of mammalian assemblages. The sampling design in each reserve consisted of 50 baited camera trap stations, with an overall sampling effort of 5015 camera trap days. We used Non-Metric Multidimension Scaling (NMDS) to compare species composition between terra firme and várzea forests, and used Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to assess how habitat types and a habitat diversity index affect mammal distributions. We recorded 21 medium and large sized mammalian species, including 20 species in terra firme and only six in várzea (3443 records). Flood pulse and isolation in várzea forest drove the dissimilarity between these two forest types. In várzea forest, medium size mammals, in general, avoided habitats associated with long flooding periods, while jaguars (&lt;i&gt;Panthera onca&lt;/i&gt;) appeared to prefer aquatic/terrestrial transition zones. Habitats that remain dry for longer periods showed more mammalian occurrence, suggesting that dispersion via soil is important even for semi-arboreal species. This is the first study to evaluate differential use of várzea habitats by terrestrial mammalian assemblages.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb921:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guilherme Costa Alvarenga, Emiliano Esterci Ramalho, Fabrício Beggiato Baccaro, Daniel Gomes da Rocha, Jefferson Ferreira-Ferreira, Paulo Estefano Dineli Bobrowiec&lt;/p&gt;

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505f:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, two-photon calcium imaging has become a standard tool to probe the function of neural circuits and to study computations in neuronal populations. However, the acquired signal is only an indirect measurement of neural activity due to the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium indicators. Different algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium measurements have been proposed in the past, but it is an open question how far performance can be improved. Here, we report the results of the &lt;i&gt;spikefinder&lt;/i&gt; challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a1WS4uygAIc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16383cd4876:d8bafa:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Berens, Jeremy Freeman, Thomas Deneux, Nicolay Chenkov, Thomas McColgan, Artur Speiser, Jakob H.

Recognition of the functional sites of genes is also a fundamental step in gene structure predictions in the most powerful programs. The best approaches to this type of recognition use sophisticated classifiers, such as support vector machines. However, with the rapid accumulation of sequence data, methods for combining many sources of evidence are necessary as it is unlikely that a single classifier can solve this type of problem with the best possible performance. A major issue is that the number of possible models to combine is large and the use of all of these models is impractical. In this paper, we present a framework that is based on floating search for combining as many classifiers as needed for the recognition of any functional sites of a gene.

Recognition of the functional sites of genes is also a fundamental step in gene structure predictions in the most powerful programs. The best approaches to this type of recognition use sophisticated classifiers, such as support vector machines. However, with the rapid accumulation of sequence data, methods for combining many sources of evidence are necessary as it is unlikely that a single classifier can solve this type of problem with the best possible performance. A major issue is that the number of possible models to combine is large and the use of all of these models is impractical. In this paper, we present a framework that is based on floating search for combining as many classifiers as needed for the recognition of any functional sites of a gene. The methodology can be used for the recognition of translation initiation sites, donor and acceptor splice sites and stop codons. Furthermore, we can combine any number of classifiers that are trained on any species. The method is also scalable to large datasets, as is shown in experiments in which the whole human genome is used. The method is also applicable to other recognition tasks. We present experiments on the recognition of these four functional sites in the human genome, which is used as the target genome, and use another 20 species as sources of evidence.

In the first excited state, the H‐Bs of the fluoride complex 1cFH2 are overall strengthened, which induces the weak fluorescence emission. In addition, molecular orbital analysis demonstrates that 1cFH2 has more obvious intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character in the S1 state than 1cH2 formed between the probe 1c and two water molecules, which also gives reason to the weaker fluorescence intensity of 1cFH2.

However, the behavior of such systems before steady-state is poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed the properties of the input-output curves for each of these systems as they approach steady-state. In ligand-receptor systems, the EC50 (concentration of the ligand that occupies 50% of the receptors) is higher before the system reaches steady-state. Based on this behavior, we have previously defined PRESS (for pre-equilibrium sensing and signaling), a general systems level mechanism cells may use to overcome input saturation. Originally, we showed that, given a step stimulation, PRESS operates when the kinetics of ligand-receptor binding are slower than the downstream signaling steps. Now, we show that, provided the input increases slowly, it is not essential for the ligand binding reaction itself to be slow. In addition, we demonstrate that covalent modification cycles and gene expression systems may also operate in PRESS mode. Thus, nearly all biochemical processes may operate in PRESS mode, suggesting that this mechanism may be ubiquitous in cell signaling systems.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163b304bfc1:2b10fcb:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Ligand-receptor systems, covalent modification cycles, and transcriptional networks are basic units of signaling systems and their steady-state properties are well understood. However, the behavior of such systems before steady-state is poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed the properties of the input-output curves for each of these systems as they approach steady-state. In ligand-receptor systems, the EC50 (concentration of the ligand that occupies 50% of the receptors) is higher before the system reaches steady-state. Based on this behavior, we have previously defined PRESS (for pre-equilibrium sensing and signaling), a general systems level mechanism cells may use to overcome input saturation. Originally, we showed that, given a step stimulation, PRESS operates when the kinetics of ligand-receptor binding are slower than the downstream signaling steps. Now, we show that, provided the input increases slowly, it is not essential for the ligand binding reaction itself to be slow. In addition, we demonstrate that covalent modification cycles and gene expression systems may also operate in PRESS mode.

Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7213:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Beau Oldenburg, Marijtje Van Duijn, René Veenstra&lt;/p&gt;

Exosomes are endosome-derived membrane vesicles that contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The exosomal transcriptome mediates intercellular communication, and represents an understudied reservoir of novel biomarkers for human diseases. Next-generation sequencing enables complex quantitative characterization of exosomal RNAs from diverse sources. However, detailed protocols describing exosome purification for preparation of exosomal RNA-sequence (RNA-Seq) libraries are lacking. Here we compared methods for isolation of exosomes and extraction of exosomal RNA from human cell-free serum, as well as strategies for attaining equal representation of samples within pooled RNA-Seq libraries. We compared commercial precipitation with ultracentrifugation for exosome purification and confirmed the presence of exosomes &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; both transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Exosomal RNA extraction was compared using four different RNA purification methods. We determined the minimal starting volume of serum required for exosome preparation and showed that high quality exosomal RNA can be isolated from sera stored for over a decade. Finally, RNA-Seq libraries were successfully prepared with exosomal RNAs extracted from human cell-free serum, cataloguing both coding and non-coding exosomal transcripts. This method provides researchers with strategic options to prepare RNA-Seq libraries and compare RNA-Seq data quantitatively from minimal volumes of fresh and archival human cell-free serum for disease biomarker discovery.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475054:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emily N.

This study describes differences in species richness and composition of the assemblages of galling insects and their host plants at different spatial scales. Sampling was conducted along altitudinal gradients composed of &lt;i&gt;campos rupestres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;campos de altitude&lt;/i&gt; of two mountain complexes in southeastern Brazil: Espinhaço Range and Mantiqueira Range. The following hypotheses were tested: i) local and regional richness of host plants and galling insects are positively correlated; ii) beta diversity is the most important component of regional diversity of host plants and galling insects; and iii) Turnover is the main mechanism driving beta diversity of both host plants and galling insects. Local richness of galling insects and host plants increased with increasing regional richness of species, suggesting a pattern of unsaturated communities. The additive partition of regional richness (γ) into local and beta components shows that local richnesses (α) of species of galling insects and host plants are low relative to regional richness; the beta (β) component incorporates most of the regional richness. The multi-scale analysis of additive partitioning showed similar patterns for galling insects and host plants with the local component (α) incorporated a small part of regional richness. Beta diversity of galling insects and host plants were mainly the result of turnover, with little contribution from nesting. Although the species composition of galling insects and host plant species varied among sample sites, mountains and even mountain ranges, local richness remained relatively low. In this way, the addition of local habitats with different landscapes substantially affects regional richness. Each mountain contributes fundamentally to the composition of regional diversity of galling insects and host plants, and so the design of future conservation strategies should incorporate multiple scales.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7217:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marcel Serra Coelho, Marco Antônio Alves Carneiro, Cristina Alves Branco, Rafael Augusto Xavier Borges, Geraldo Wilson Fernandes&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Globally the number of people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has risen significantly over the last few decades. Aligned to this is a growing use of community health workers (CHWs) to deliver T2DM self-management support with good clinical outcomes especially in High Income Countries (HIC). Evidence and lessons from these interventions can be useful for Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa that are experiencing a marked increase in T2DM prevalence.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to examine how CHW have been utilized to support T2DM self-management globally, their preparation for and supervision to perform their functions.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;The review was guided by a stepwise approach outlined in the framework for scoping reviews developed by Arksey and O’Malley. Peer reviewed scientific and grey literature was searched using a string of keywords, selecting English full-text articles published between 2000 and 2015. Articles were selected using inclusion criteria, charted and content analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1008 studies were identified of which 54 full text articles were selected. Most (53) of the selected studies were in HIC and targeted mostly minority populations in low resource settings. CHWs were mostly deployed to provide education, support, and advocacy. Structured curriculum based education was the most frequently reported service provided by CHWs to support T2DM self-management. Support services included informational, emotional, appraisal and instrumental support. Models of CHW care included facility linked nurse-led CHW coordination, facility-linked CHW led coordination and standalone CHW interventions without facility interaction.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;CHWs play several roles in T2DM self-management, including structured education, ongoing support and health system advocacy. Preparing and coordinating CHWs for these roles is crucial and needs further research and strengthening.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf4:3dd877af</id><engagementRate>5.0</engagementRate><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bonaventure Amandi Egbujie, Peter Arthur Delobelle, Naomi Levitt, Thandi Puoane, David Sanders, Brian van Wyk&lt;/p&gt;

Here we show that a daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein, Cep120, plays a critical inhibitory role at daughter centrioles. Depletion of Cep120 in quiescent mouse and human cells causes accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) components including Pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, Ninein and Cep170. The elevated PCM levels result in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome. Consequently, loss of Cep120 leads to aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. Our results indicate that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centriole, and defines a potentially new molecular defect underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35439</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item></keywords><fingerprint>f81e172c</fingerprint><published>1525824000000</published><title>A novel Cep120-dependent mechanism inhibits centriole maturation in quiescent cells</title><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35439</canonicalUrl><engagement>8</engagement><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The two centrioles of the centrosome in quiescent cells are inherently asymmetric structures that differ in age, morphology and function.

This work presents a novel computational method to elucidate metabolic changes that empower community formation and thus guide the optimization of co-cultures for a desired application.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</originId><author><name>Robert van Woesik</name></author><updated>1525813200000</updated><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>504f9ef5</fingerprint><published>1525813200000</published><title>Keeping up with sea-level rise: Carbonate production rates in Palau and Yap, western Pacific Ocean</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert van Woesik, Christopher William Cacciapaglia&lt;/p&gt;
Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion. Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506a:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert van Woesik, Christopher William Cacciapaglia&lt;/p&gt;

Cells switch between quiescence and proliferation states for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regeneration. At the restriction point (R-point), cells become irreversibly committed to the completion of the cell cycle independent of mitogen. The mechanism involving hyper-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and activation of transcription factor E2F is linked to the R-point passage. However, stress stimuli trigger exit from the cell cycle back to the mitogen-sensitive quiescent state after Rb hyper-phosphorylation but only until APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; inactivation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to investigate the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation in mammalian cells with respect to mitogen and stress signals. The model integrates the current mechanistic knowledge and accounts for the recent experimental observations with cells exiting quiescence and proliferating cells. We show that Cyclin E:Cdk2 couples Rb-E2F and APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable switches and temporally segregates the R-point and the G1/S transition. A redox-dependent mutual antagonism between APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; and its inhibitor Emi1 makes the inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable. We show that the levels of Cdk inhibitor (CKI) and mitogen control the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation. Further, we propose that shifting of the mitogen-induced transcriptional program to G2-phase in proliferating cells might result in an intermediate Cdk2 activity at the mitotic exit and in the immediate inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our study builds a coherent framework and generates hypotheses that can be further explored by experiments.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84553:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nishtha Pandey, P.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The standard clinical approach to non-occupational HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) focuses on biomedical aspects of the intervention, but may overlook co-occurring or ‘syndemic’ psychosocial problems that reinforce future vulnerability to HIV. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in a cohort of Ontario nPEP patients, and explored the relationship between syndemic burden and HIV risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between 07/2013-08/2016, we distributed a self-administered questionnaire to patients presenting to three clinics in Toronto and Ottawa seeking nPEP for sexual HIV exposures. We used validated screening tools to estimate the prevalence of depression (CES-D score ≥16), harmful alcohol use (AUDIT ≥8), problematic drug use (DUDIT ≥6 men/≥2 women), and sexual compulsivity (SCS ≥24) among men who have sex with men (MSM) respondents. In exploratory analyses, we examined the relationships between syndemic conditions using univariable logistic regression models, and the relationship between syndemic count (total number of syndemic conditions per participant) and HIV risk, as estimated by the HIRI-MSM score, using linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The 186 MSM included in the analysis had median age 31 (IQR = 26–36), including 87.6% having a college/undergraduate degree or higher. Overall, 53.8% screened positive for depression, 34.4% for harmful alcohol use, 30.1% for problematic drug use, and 16.1% for sexual compulsivity. Most participants (74.2%) had at least one syndemic condition and 46.8% had more than one. Exploratory analyses suggested positive associations between depression and harmful alcohol use (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.13, 3.94) and between harmful alcohol use and problematic drug use (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 0.65, 2.29). Syndemic count was associated with increased HIRI-MSM risk scores in univariable (2.2, 95%CI = 1.0, 3.3 per syndemic condition) and multivariable (2.1, 95%CI = 0.6, 3.6) linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of syndemic conditions in MSM seeking nPEP for sexual exposure is alarmingly high, and is associated with underlying HIV risk. Routine screening for these conditions may identify opportunities for intervention and could alleviate future vulnerability to HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2344:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Steven A.

Beyond previous studies, this work suggests the relevance of an integrated in silico, in vitro, and in vivo bioengineering approach as a basis for the safe and efficient clinical translation of TEHVs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x</originId><author><name>Mingnan Qu</name></author><crawled>1526635169773</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/vtjk1tSyyDE/s41598-018-26283-x</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>4e5f4cec</fingerprint><published>1526626800000</published><title>Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO2</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26283-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vtjk1tSyyDE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>511</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26283-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26283_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163728c07ed:5098e7a:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26283-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vtjk1tSyyDE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198079</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198079</originId><author><name>Ewelina Stelcer</name></author><updated>1528146000000</updated><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198079</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>e6cd5caf</fingerprint><published>1528146000000</published><title>Forced differentiation &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; leads to stress-induced activation of DNA damage response in hiPSC-derived chondrocyte-like cells</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198079</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ewelina Stelcer, Katarzyna Kulcenty, Marcin Rucinski, Karol Jopek, Magdalena Richter, Tomasz Trzeciak, Wiktoria Maria Suchorska&lt;/p&gt;
A human induced pluripotent stem cell line (GPCCi001-A) created by our group was differentiated towards chondrocyte-like cells (ChiPS) via monolayer culturing with growth factors. ChiPS are promising because they have the potential to be used in tissue engineering to regenerate articular cartilage. However, their safety must be confirmed before they can be routinely used in regenerative medicine. Using microarray analysis, we compared the ChiPS to both GPCCi001-A cells and chondrocytes. The analysis showed that, compared to both GPCCi001-A cells and chondrocytes, the expression of genes engaged in DNA damage and in the tumor protein p53 signalling pathways was significantly higher in the ChiPS. The significant amount of DNA double strand breaks and increased DNA damage response may lead to incomplete DNA repair and the accumulation of mutations and, ultimately, to genetic instability. These findings provide evidence indicating that the differentiation process &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; places stress on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

p38 has long been known as a central mediator of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in brown adipocytes, which positively regulate the transcription of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1). However, the physiological role of p38 in adipose tissues, especially the white adipose tissue (WAT), is largely unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking p38α in adipose tissues display a lean phenotype, improved metabolism, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, ablation of p38α causes minimal effects on brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult mice, as evident from undetectable changes in UCP-1 expression, mitochondrial function, body temperature (BT), and energy expenditure. In contrast, genetic ablation of p38α in adipose tissues not only markedly facilitates the browning in WAT upon cold stress but also prevents diet-induced obesity. Consistently, pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α remarkably enhances the browning of WAT and has metabolic benefits. Furthermore, our data suggest that p38α deficiency promotes white-to-beige adipocyte reprogramming in a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, inhibition of p38α stimulates the UCP-1 transcription through PKA and its downstream cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which form a positive feedback loop that functions to reinforce the white-to-beige phenotypic switch during cold exposure. Together, our study reveals that inhibition of p38α is able to promote WAT browning and confer metabolic benefits. Our study also indicates that p38α in WAT represents an exciting pharmacological target to combat obesity and metabolic diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uSUUK1J4vqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f3:f3bf0074</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shengjie Zhang, Hongchao Cao, Yan Li, Yanyan Jing, Shengnan Liu, Cheng Ye, Hui Wang, Shuxian Yu, Chengyuan Peng, Lijian Hui, Yu-cheng Wang, Haibing Zhang, Feifan Guo, Qiwei Zhai, Hui Wang, Ruimin Huang, Ling Zhang, Jingjing Jiang, Wei Liu, Hao Ying&lt;/p&gt;

The protein kinase (PK, kinome) family is one of the largest families in plants and regulates almost all aspects of plant processes, including plant development and stress responses. Despite their important functions, comprehensive functional classification, evolutionary analysis and expression patterns of the cotton PK gene family has yet to be performed on PK genes. In this study, we identified the cotton kinomes in the &lt;i&gt;Gossypium raimondii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium arboretum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gossypium barbadense&lt;/i&gt; genomes and classified them into 7 groups and 122–24 subfamilies using software HMMER v3.0 scanning and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. Some conserved exon-intron structures were identified not only in cotton species but also in primitive plants, ferns and moss, suggesting the significant function and ancient origination of these PK genes. Collinearity analysis revealed that 16.6 million years ago (Mya) cotton-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) events may have played a partial role in the expansion of the cotton kinomes, whereas tandem duplication (TD) events mainly contributed to the expansion of the cotton RLK group. Synteny analysis revealed that tetraploidization of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; contributed to the expansion of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; PKs. Global expression analysis of cotton PKs revealed stress-specific and fiber development-related expression patterns, suggesting that many cotton PKs might be involved in the regulation of the stress response and fiber development processes. This study provides foundational information for further studies on the evolution and molecular function of cotton PKs.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b5:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jun Yan, Guilin Li, Xingqi Guo, Yang Li, Xuecheng Cao&lt;/p&gt;

Synteny analysis revealed that tetraploidization of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; contributed to the expansion of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; PKs. Global expression analysis of cotton PKs revealed stress-specific and fiber development-related expression patterns, suggesting that many cotton PKs might be involved in the regulation of the stress response and fiber development processes. This study provides foundational information for further studies on the evolution and molecular function of cotton PKs.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198692</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198692</originId><author><name>Panagiotis Balermpas</name></author><updated>1528318800000</updated><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198692</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>c4f39229</fingerprint><published>1528318800000</published><title>Repeated in-field radiosurgery for locally recurrent brain metastases: Feasibility, results and survival in a heavily treated patient cohort</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198692</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Panagiotis Balermpas, Susanne Stera, Jens Müller von der Grün, Britta Loutfi-Krauss, Marie-Thérèse Forster, Marlies Wagner, Christian Keller, Claus Rödel, Volker Seifert, Oliver Blanck, Robert Wolff&lt;/p&gt;
Purpose &lt;p&gt;Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established primary treatment for newly diagnosed brain metastases with high local control rates. However, data about local re-irradiation in case of local failure after SRS (re-SRS) are rare. We evaluated the feasibility, efficacy and patient selection characteristics in treating locally recurrent metastases with a second course of SRS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively evaluated patients with brain metastases treated with re-SRS for local tumor progression between 2011 and 2017. Patient and treatment characteristics as well as rates of tumor control, survival and toxicity were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 32 locally recurrent brain metastases in 31 patients were irradiated with re-SRS. Median age at re-SRS was 64.9 years. The primary histology was breast cancer and non-small-cellular lung cancer (NSCLC) in respectively 10 cases (31.3%), in 5 cases malignant melanoma (15.6%). In the first SRS-course 19 metastases (59.4%) and in the re-SRS-course 29 metastases (90.6%) were treated with CyberKnife&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and the others with Gamma Knife. Median planning target volume (PTV) for re-SRS was 2.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (range, 0.1–37.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and median dose prescribed to the PTV was 19 Gy (range, 12–28 Gy) in 1–5 fractions to the median 69% isodose (range, 53–80%). The 1-year overall survival rate was 61.7% and the 1-year local control rate was 79.5%. The overall rate of radiological radio-necrosis was 16.1% and four patients (12.9%) experienced grade ≥ 3 toxicities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases after prior local SRS appears to be feasible with acceptable toxicity and can be considered as salvage treatment option for selected patients with high performance status.

Many implementations of pooled screens in mammalian cells rely on linking an element of interest to a barcode, with the latter subsequently quantitated by next generation sequencing. However, substantial uncoupling between these paired elements during lentiviral production has been reported, especially as the distance between elements increases. We detail that PCR amplification is another major source of uncoupling, and becomes more pronounced with increased amounts of DNA template molecules and PCR cycles. To lessen uncoupling in systems that use paired elements for detection, we recommend minimizing the distance between elements, using low and equal template DNA inputs for plasmid and genomic DNA during PCR, and minimizing the number of PCR cycles. We also present a vector design for conducting combinatorial CRISPR screens that enables accurate barcode-based detection with a single short sequencing read and minimal uncoupling.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd6f:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mudra Hegde, Christine Strand, Ruth E.

Aluminum-based adjuvants have widely been used in human vaccines since 1926. In the absence of antigens, aluminum-based adjuvants can initiate the inflammatory preparedness of innate cells, yet the impact of antigens on this response has not been investigated so far. In this study, we address the modulating effect of vaccine antigens on the monocyte-derived innate response by comparing processes initiated by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and by Infanrix, an Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-adjuvanted trivalent combination vaccine (DTaP), containing diphtheria toxoid (D), tetanus toxoid (T) and acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine antigens. A systems-wide analysis of stimulated monocytes was performed in which full proteome analysis was combined with targeted transcriptome analysis and cytokine analysis. This comprehensive study revealed four major differences in the monocyte response, between plain Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation conditions: (I) DTaP increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; did not; (II) Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increased the gene expression of &lt;i&gt;IFNγ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;IL-17a&lt;/i&gt; in contrast to the limited induction or even downregulation by DTaP; (III) increased expression of type I interferons-induced proteins was not observed upon DTaP stimulation, but was observed upon Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation; (IV) opposing regulation of protein localization pathways was observed for Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation, related to the induction of exocytosis by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alone. This study highlights that vaccine antigens can antagonize Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced programming of the innate immune responses at the monocyte level.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c15:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sietske Kooijman, Jolanda Brummelman, Cécile A.

Aluminum-based adjuvants have widely been used in human vaccines since 1926. In the absence of antigens, aluminum-based adjuvants can initiate the inflammatory preparedness of innate cells, yet the impact of antigens on this response has not been investigated so far. In this study, we address the modulating effect of vaccine antigens on the monocyte-derived innate response by comparing processes initiated by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and by Infanrix, an Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-adjuvanted trivalent combination vaccine (DTaP), containing diphtheria toxoid (D), tetanus toxoid (T) and acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine antigens.

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16383cd4876:d8bafb:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Hyun Bak, Seogjoo J.

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f2:f3bf0074</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;

Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198602</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198602</originId><author><name>Yuexin Xia</name></author><updated>1528232400000</updated><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198602</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>feae9dab</fingerprint><published>1528232400000</published><title>The prognostic significance of long noncoding RNAs in bladder cancer: A meta-analysis</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198602</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuexin Xia, Zhiyuan Liu, Weijian Yu, Shihang Zhou, Linnan Shao, Wenqian Song, Ming Liu&lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common urologic malignancies and it is urgently needed to identify novel potential prognostic biomarkers for predicting prognosis and progression of patients with BC in clinical practice. Previous research has revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played critical roles in BC, and may serve as novel potential prognostic biomarkers in patients with BC. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the prognostic potential of lncRNAs in BC patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). According to the predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 9 recently published articles comprising 13 lncRNAs and 666 BC patients were included into this meta-analysis. We analyzed the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the relationship between lncRNAs expression and survival outcomes. We also analyzed the odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the association between lncRNAs expression and clinicopathological characteristics, including histological grade, gender, multifocality, tumor size, and tumor stage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that high lncRNAs expression was associated with shorter overall survival in Asian BC patients (pooled HR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.35–4.00, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, random-effect). High lncRNAs expression levels were significantly associated with histological grade (G2-G3 vs. G1: OR = 3.857, 95%CI: 1.293–11.502, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015, random-effect).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In summary, this meta-analysis has demonstrated that lncRNAs could be used as potential prognostic markers for BC and high lncRNAs expression could predict poor prognosis among Asian BC patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd3:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuexin Xia, Zhiyuan Liu, Weijian Yu, Shihang Zhou, Linnan Shao, Wenqian Song, Ming Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is modeled to explore the mechanisms of this effective, but poorly understood, treatment for motor symptoms of drug-refractory Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. First, a neural field model of the corticothalamic-basal ganglia (CTBG) system is developed that reproduces key clinical features of Parkinson’s disease, including its characteristic 4–8 Hz and 13–30 Hz electrophysiological signatures. Deep brain stimulation of the STN is then modeled and shown to suppress the pathological 13–30 Hz (beta) activity for physiologically realistic and optimized stimulus parameters. This supports the idea that suppression of abnormally coherent activity in the CTBG system is a major factor in DBS therapy for Parkinson’s disease, by permitting normal dynamics to resume. At high stimulus intensities, nonlinear effects in the target population mediate wave-wave interactions between resonant beta activity and the stimulus pulse train, leading to complex spectral structure that shows remarkable similarity to that seen in steady-state evoked potential experiments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nyh-p6NdIb8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163ad15e82f:1385daa:c2c34441</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eli J.

Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163892bfa89:710ccdf:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function.

Since endophytes can affect metabolism of host plants, they are expected to be used to improve crop quality, especially for crops with organoleptic sensitive products such as wine grape. However, details of metabolic interactions between endophytes and host plants were less understood. In this work, we used high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the metabolites of fruit flesh cells of grape treated with dual culture of different endophytic fungal strains (EFS). We observed that the dual-culture with different fungal strains show different metabolites composition in grape cells. In response to different EFS, quantities of detected metabolites in grape cells varied from 6 to 17 in this assay, and 1 to 11 novel metabolites were introduced into metabolome of grape cells. Dual-culture with fungal strains CS2, RH16 and RH5 introduced the highest quantities (10 or 11) of novel metabolites in grape cells. More importantly, the modification of metabolic profiles in grape cells &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; fungal endophytes appeared to be fungal strain/genus-specificity. Overall, this work revealed that introduction of specific metabolites in host plants may be one consequence during the process of endophytes-host metabolic interactions, which raise the possibility to shape grape qualities and characteristics using tool of fungal endophytes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42264:5785ab88</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li-Hua Huang, Ming-Quan Yuan, Xiu-Jin Ao, An-Yun Ren, Han-Bo Zhang, Ming-Zhi Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Spices and herbs are key dietary ingredients used across cultures worldwide. Beyond their use as flavoring and coloring agents, the popularity of these aromatic plant products in culinary preparations has been attributed to their antimicrobial properties. Last few decades have witnessed an exponential growth of biomedical literature investigating the impact of spices and herbs on health, presenting an opportunity to mine for patterns from empirical evidence. Systematic investigation of empirical evidence to enumerate the health consequences of culinary herbs and spices can provide valuable insights into their therapeutic utility. We implemented a text mining protocol to assess the health impact of spices by assimilating, both, their positive and negative effects. We conclude that spices show broad-spectrum benevolence across a range of disease categories in contrast to negative effects that are comparatively narrow-spectrum. We also implement a strategy for disease-specific culinary recommendations of spices based on their therapeutic tradeoff against adverse effects. Further by integrating spice-phytochemical-disease associations, we identify bioactive spice phytochemicals potentially involved in their therapeutic effects. Our study provides a systems perspective on health effects of culinary spices and herbs with applications for dietary recommendations as well as identification of phytochemicals potentially involved in underlying molecular mechanisms.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1b:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by N.

Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of the human cornea is crucial for understanding the development of corneal diseases and impact of surgical treatments (e.g., corneal laser surgery, corneal cross-linking). Using a Surface Force Apparatus we investigated the transient viscous response of the anterior cornea from donor human eyes compressed between macroscopic crossed cylinders. Corneal biomechanics was analyzed using linear viscoelastic theory and interpreted in the framework of a biphasic model of soft hydrated porous tissues, including a significant contribution from the pressurization and viscous flow of fluid within the corneal tissue. Time-resolved measurements of tissue deformation and careful determination of the relaxation time provided an elastic modulus in the range between 0.17 and 1.43 MPa, and fluid permeability of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/(N∙s). The permeability decreased as the deformation was increased above a strain level of about 10%, indicating that the interstitial space between fibrils of the corneal stromal matrix was reduced under the effect of strong compression. This effect may play a major role in determining the observed rate-dependent non-linear stress-strain response of the anterior cornea, which underlies the shape and optical properties of the tissue.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd75:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Zappone, Navinkumar J.

Statistical inference is a widely-used, powerful tool for learning about natural processes in diverse fields. The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50% the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2a:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cole C.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Epiretinal traction is not responsible only for epiretinal but also intraretinal changes. This study aims to describe structural and vascular intraretinal changes after macular peeling in idiopathic (iERM) vs diabetic ERM (dERM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001). The GFAP expression was significantly higher in dERMs (p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The intraretinal changes are different in iERMs and dERMs, as increased expression of CEIFLs in iERMs vs ICs in dERMs. The CEIFLs are associated with worse anatomical and functional outcomes in iERMs, whereas GFAP espression in peeled ILMs is higher in dERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475067:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mario R.

We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001). The GFAP expression was significantly higher in dERMs (p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The intraretinal changes are different in iERMs and dERMs, as increased expression of CEIFLs in iERMs vs ICs in dERMs. The CEIFLs are associated with worse anatomical and functional outcomes in iERMs, whereas GFAP espression in peeled ILMs is higher in dERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198124</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198124</originId><author><name>Ingrid Mogren</name></author><updated>1527627600000</updated><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198124</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>f2e7f33d</fingerprint><published>1527627600000</published><title>Maternal height and risk of caesarean section in singleton births in Sweden—A population-based study using data from the Swedish Pregnancy Register 2011 to 2016</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198124</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ingrid Mogren, Maria Lindqvist, Kerstin Petersson, Carin Nilses, Rhonda Small, Gabriel Granåsen, Kristina Edvardsson&lt;/p&gt;
Caesarean section (CS) has short and long term adverse health consequences, and should therefore only be undertaken when necessary. Risk factors such as maternal age, maternal body mass index (BMI) and fetal weight have been extensively investigated in relation to CS, but the significance of maternal height has been less explored in Sweden. The aim was to investigate the significance of maternal height on risk of CS in a representative, population-based sample from Sweden, also taking into account confounders. Data on singleton births in the Swedish Pregnancy Register 2011 to 2016 were collected, including women with heights of 140 cm and above, constituting a sample of 581,844 women. Data were analysed with epidemiological and biostatistical methods. Mean height was 166.1 cm. Women born outside Sweden were significantly shorter than women born in Sweden (162.8 cm vs. 167.1 cm, p&amp;lt;0.001). There was a decreasing risk of CS with increasing maternal height. This effect remained after adjustment for other risk factors for CS such as maternal age, BMI, gestational age, parity, high birth weight and country of birth. Frequency of CS was higher among women born outside Sweden compared with Swedish-born women (17.3% vs. 16.0%), however, in a multiple regression model country of birth outside Sweden diminished as a risk factor for CS. Maternal height of 178–179 cm was associated with the lowest risk of CS (OR = 0.76, CI95% 0.71–0.81), whereas height below 160 cm explained 7% of CS cases. BMI and maternal age are established factors involved in clinical assessments related to birth, and maternal height should increasingly enjoy a similar status in these considerations. Moreover, when healthcare professionals are counselling pregnant women, taller stature should be more emphasized as a positive indicator for successful vaginal birth to increase pregnant women’s confidence in giving birth vaginally, with possible positive impacts for lowering CS rates.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1f:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ingrid Mogren, Maria Lindqvist, Kerstin Petersson, Carin Nilses, Rhonda Small, Gabriel Granåsen, Kristina Edvardsson&lt;/p&gt;

This paper applies the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method to investigate the long-range correlation of monthly mean temperatures from three typical measurement stations at Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang in Northeast China from 1909 to 2014. The results reveal the memory characteristics of the climate system in this region. By comparing the temperatures from different time periods and investigating the variations of its scaling exponents at the three stations during these different time periods, we found that the monthly mean temperature has long-range correlation, which indicates that the temperature in Northeast China has long-term memory and good predictability. The monthly time series of temperatures over the past 106 years also shows good long-range correlation characteristics. These characteristics are also obviously observed in the annual mean temperature time series. Finally, we separated the centennial-length temperature time series into two time periods. These results reveal that the long-range correlations at the Harbin station over these two time periods have large variations, whereas no obvious variations are observed at the other two stations. This indicates that warming affects the regional climate system’s predictability differently at different time periods. The research results can provide a quantitative reference point for regional climate predictability assessment and future climate model evaluation.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4d:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaohui Zheng, Yi Lian, Qiguang Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559154:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper we report an initial validation of the Shape Trail Test–Child Version (STT-CV) with a non-clinical sample of children aged 6 to 9 years. The STT-CV has been developed as an age-appropriate and culturally fair direct downward extension of the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of cognitive flexibility. Children completed the STT-CV and four established measures of executive functions that assessed working memory, inhibitory control and task switching. Results showed the expected age-based differences in completion times for both parts of the STT-CV (Trail A and Trail B). Children’s performance on the STT-CV correlated significantly with all four measures of executive functions. After controlling for the effects of chronological age, completion times for Trail B remained correlated with most other measures of executive functions. These findings provide emerging evidence for the utility of the STT-CV, and highlight the need for designing and using appropriate variants of the TMT in the behavioural assessment of cognitive flexibility in developmentally and culturally diverse populations.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b94a:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amy Y.

Since several physiological processes are involved and the relation among them is complicated, analyses of single-traits is insufficient in revealing the complex mechanism of altitude acclimatization. In this study, we examined whether these physiological responses could be studied as composite phenotypes which are represented by a linear combination of physiological traits. We developed a strategy which combines both spectral clustering and PLSPM to define composite phenotypes. We captured 14 composite phenotypes from 28 physiological traits of altitude acclimatization. Using these composite phenotypes, we applied k-means to reveal hidden physiological heterogeneity in altitude acclimatization. Furthermore, we employed linear regression to systematically model oxygen saturation (SpO2) changes in altitude acclimatization and evaluated the model fitness performance. And composite phenotypes based Model 2 has better fitness than single-traits based Model 1 in all measurement indices. Therefore, this new strategy of defining and applying composite phenotypes can be considered as a general strategy of complex traits.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163c6ceb34b:4719a67:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Altitude acclimatization is the physiological process of the human body adjusting to the decreased availability of oxygen.

In summary, mutant SEMA3A is a vascular normalizing agent that can be exploited to treat cancer and, potentially, other diseases characterized by pathological angiogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04554-5</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04554-5</originId><author><name>Cheng-Jian Zhang</name></author><crawled>1527672529736</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/p-Y0lqA8Jrk/s41467-018-04554-5</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04554-5</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>a00bc0aa</fingerprint><published>1527663600000</published><title>Precise synthesis of sulfur-containing polymers via cooperative dual organocatalysts with high activity</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Precise synthesis of sulfur-containing polymers via cooperative dual organocatalysts with high activity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precise synthesis of sulfur-containing polymers via cooperative dual organocatalysts with high activity, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04554-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04554-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sulfur-containing polymers are useful commodities, but there is still a big challenge to produce such polymers in a controlled fashion.

The Wiener polarity number (which, nowadays, known as the Wiener polarity index and usually denoted by &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) was devised by the chemist Harold Wiener, for predicting the boiling points of alkanes.

The protein is modelled by a patchy coarse-grained representation, where the protein-protein interfaces, determined in the past by x-ray diffraction, are represented by simplified two-body interaction potentials. Our results show that the oligomerization kinetics proceeds in two steps, with the formation of meta-stable trimeric units, and the subsequent assembly into the spherical aggregates. Data are in agreement with experimental observations regarding the prevalence of different aggregation states at specific ambient conditions.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b81:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinju Ma, Liyi Ma, Hong Zhang, Zhongquan Zhang, Youqiong Wang, Kai Li, Xiaoming Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Prenatal detection of the fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; status can be useful in the management of RhD incompatibility to identify fetuses at risk of hemolytic disease. Hemolytic disease causes morbidity and mortality of the fetus in the neonatal period. The routine use of antenatal and postnatal anti-D prophylaxis has reduced the incidence of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. This study describe the detection of fetal RhD antigens in blood of RhD negative pregnant women using a nanopolymer coated electrochemical biosensor for medical diagnosis. Cell free fetal DNA in maternal plasma was also used to genotyping fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; status using multiplex real-time PCR. Twenty-six RhD negative pregnant women in different gestational ages were included in the study. RhD positive fetal antibodies detected with a developed biosensor in maternal blood of RhD negative mothers. The electrochemical measurements were performed on a PalmSens potentiostat, and corundum ceramic based screen printed gold electrode combined with the reference Ag/AgCl electrode, and the auxiliary Au/Pd (98/2%) electrode. Fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; genotyping performed using fluorescence-based multiplex real-time PCR exons 5 and 7 of the &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; gene. The fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; status of 26 RhD negative cases were detected 21 as RhD positive and 5 as RhD negative with electrochemical biosensor. Fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; status confirmed with extracted fetal DNA in maternal plasma using multiplex real-time PCR &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; genotyping and by serological test after delivery. The new method for fetal RhD detection in early pregnancy is useful and can be carry out rapidly in clinical diagnosis. Using automated biosensors are reproducible, quick and results can be generated within a few minutes compared to noninvasive fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; genotyping from maternal plasma with real-time PCR-based techniques.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β1(unit for all markers: pg/mL) were increased from baseline by smaller increments in the navigation TKA cohort compared with the conventional TKA group at 24 hours (17.06 vs 29.39, p = 0.02; 0.51 vs 0.83, p = 0.16; –0.04 vs 0.36, p &amp;lt; 0.01 and –48.18 vs 63.24, p&amp;lt; 0.01, respectively) and at 72 hours (12.27 vs 16.87, p = 0.01; –0.40 vs 0.48, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 0.58 vs 0.98, p = 0.07 and –55.16 vs 63.71, p &amp;lt; 0.01, respectively). IL-10 levels in drainage fluids collected 24 hours after TKA were also significantly lower in the navigation group versus the conventional TKA group (8.55 vs 12.32, p &amp;lt; 0.01). According to our evidence, the merits of computer-assisted navigation TKA are augmented by low levels of inflammation markers.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd1:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shu-Jui Kuo, Horng-Chaung Hsu, Ching-Jen Wang, Ka-Kit Siu, Ya-Hung Hsu, Jih-Yang Ko, Chih-Hsin Tang&lt;/p&gt;

Cannibalism is a commonly observed phenomenon in arthropod species having relevant consequences for population dynamics and individual fitness. It is a context-dependent behaviour and an understanding of the factors affecting cannibalism rate is crucial to highlight its ecological relevance. In mosquitoes, cannibalism between larval stages has been widely documented, and the role of density, food availability and length of contact between individuals also ascertained. However, although mosquitoes can develop in temporary water habitats with very heterogeneous topologies, the role of the site shape where cannibals and victims co-occur has been instead overlooked. In this paper, we investigated this issue by using a simulation approach and laboratory cannibalism experiments between old (third- and fourth-instars) and young (first-instar) larvae of the tiger mosquito &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. Three virtual spaces with different shapes were simulated and the number of larval encounters was estimated in each one to assess whether the spatial shape affected the number of encounters between cannibal and victims. Then, experimental trials in containers with similar shapes to those used in the simulations were performed, and the cannibalism rate was estimated at 24 and 48h. Our results showed that the spatial shape plays a role on cannibalism interactions, affecting the number of encounters between individuals. Indeed, in the experimental trials performed, we observed the highest cannibalism rate in the container with the highest number of encounters predicted by the simulations. Interestingly, we found also that spatial shape can affect cannibalism not only by affecting the number of encounters, but also the number of encounters “favorable” for cannibalistic events. Temporary waters are inhabited by several species other than mosquitoes. Our results, showing an influence of the spatial shape on cannibalism in &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; larvae, add a new critical factor to those affecting ecological interactions in these habitats.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c29:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina Mastrantonio, Graziano Crasta, Arianna Puggioli, Romeo Bellini, Sandra Urbanelli, Daniele Porretta&lt;/p&gt;

Our results, showing an influence of the spatial shape on cannibalism in &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; larvae, add a new critical factor to those affecting ecological interactions in these habitats.</content></content></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/839?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/839?rss=1</originId><author><name>Hand, E.</name></author><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/839?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Astronomy, Science and Policy</item></keywords><fingerprint>3c8d6cb4</fingerprint><published>1527183688000</published><title>Rival giant telescopes join to seek U.S. funding</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/839.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce96a:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2</originId><author><name>Meihong Chen</name></author><crawled>1526980668897</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/rMN9sc_wO_s/s41598-018-26335-2</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26335-2</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>d92b991f</fingerprint><published>1526972400000</published><title>Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen protects lung from hypoxia/re-oxygenation injury by reducing hydroxyl radical production and inhibiting inflammatory responses, Published online: 22 May 2018;

Background &lt;p&gt;To accommodate training for unilaterally affected patients (e.g. stroke), the Lokomat (a popular robotic exoskeleton-based gait trainer) provides the possibility to set the amount of movement guidance for each leg independently. Given the interlimb couplings, such asymmetrical settings may result in complex effects, in which ipsilateral activity co-depends on the amount of guidance offered to the contralateral leg. To test this idea, the effect of asymmetrical guidance on muscle activity was explored.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;15 healthy participants walked in the Lokomat at two speeds (1 and 2 km/h) and guidance levels (30% and 100%), during symmetrical (both legs receiving 30% or 100% guidance) and asymmetrical conditions (one leg receiving 30% and the other 100% guidance) resulting in eight unique conditions. Activity of the right leg was recorded from Erector Spinae, Gluteus Medius, Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris, Medial Gastrocnemius and Tibialis Anterior.

Background &lt;p&gt;To accommodate training for unilaterally affected patients (e.g. stroke), the Lokomat (a popular robotic exoskeleton-based gait trainer) provides the possibility to set the amount of movement guidance for each leg independently. Given the interlimb couplings, such asymmetrical settings may result in complex effects, in which ipsilateral activity co-depends on the amount of guidance offered to the contralateral leg. To test this idea, the effect of asymmetrical guidance on muscle activity was explored.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;15 healthy participants walked in the Lokomat at two speeds (1 and 2 km/h) and guidance levels (30% and 100%), during symmetrical (both legs receiving 30% or 100% guidance) and asymmetrical conditions (one leg receiving 30% and the other 100% guidance) resulting in eight unique conditions. Activity of the right leg was recorded from Erector Spinae, Gluteus Medius, Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris, Medial Gastrocnemius and Tibialis Anterior. Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to assess whether ipsilateral muscle activity depended on guidance settings for the contralateral leg.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Muscle output amplitude not only depended on ipsilateral guidance settings, but also on the amount of guidance provided to the contralateral leg. More specifically, when the contralateral leg received less guidance, ipsilateral activity of Gluteus Medius and Medial Gastrocnemius increased during stance. Conversely, when the contralateral leg received more guidance, ipsilateral muscle activity for these muscles decreased.

Background &lt;p&gt;Creatine kinase (CK) has been associated with reduced inflammation in obesity while inflammation is associated with obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the relationship between CK and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in a general population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;CK and hs-CRP were measured in the population-based Tromsø study that included entire birth cohorts and random samples of citizens between 30–87 years of age. The analyses were performed sex-stratified in 5969 men and 6827 women.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;CK correlated negatively with hs-CRP in men (r = -0.08, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and women (r = -0.06, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). In univariable regression analyses, CK associated negatively with hs-CRP in men (&lt;i&gt;ß&lt;/i&gt; = -0.14, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.10, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and women (&lt;i&gt;ß&lt;/i&gt; = -0.13, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.08, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). Mean CK declined from the 2. to the 4. quartiles of hs-CRP in both genders (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001 for trends). There were positive correlations between CK and body mass index (BMI) in men (r = 0.10, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and women (r = 0.07, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed a 0.13 unit decrease in hs-CRP (mg/dl) per unit CK increase in men (95% CI -0.35 to -0.20) and 0.29 mg/dl in women (95% CI -0.36 to -0.21) when adjusted for age, BMI, lipids, s-glucose, s-creatinine, transaminases and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;CK were inversely and independently associated with hs-CRP in a general population. These data provide evidence that CK might have anti-inflammatory properties, but the mechanism and clinical implications are unclarified.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c21:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Svein Ivar Bekkelund, Stein Harald Johnsen&lt;/p&gt;

BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1–10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e37:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arturo Blazquez-Navarro, Thomas Schachtner, Ulrik Stervbo, Anett Sefrin, Maik Stein, Timm H.

Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24988?af=R</link><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24988?af=R</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 17, Page 1013-1017, June 30, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24988?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a0dd270c</fingerprint><published>1525850843000</published><title>Issue Information</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 17, Page 1013-1017, June 30, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1639679584a:2569c0:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/toc/1096987x/2018/39/17&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, Page 1013-1017, June 30, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25226?af=R</link><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25226?af=R</originId><author><name>KenSakata</name></author><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><description>Based on the energy decomposition analysis of an interacting system, we propose a method for force constant decomposition analysis with respect to the specific normal coordinate.

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by inter-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163846dad2c:e40dc:d63e3ae2</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;

Our ability to parse our acoustic environment relies on the brain’s capacity to extract statistical regularities from surrounding sounds. Previous work in regularity extraction has predominantly focused on the brain’s sensitivity to predictable patterns in sound sequences. However, natural sound environments are rarely completely predictable, often containing some level of randomness, yet the brain is able to effectively interpret its surroundings by extracting useful information from stochastic sounds. It has been previously shown that the brain is sensitive to the marginal lower-order statistics of sound sequences (i.e., mean and variance). In this work, we investigate the brain’s sensitivity to higher-order statistics describing temporal dependencies between sound events through a series of change detection experiments, where listeners are asked to detect changes in randomness in the pitch of tone sequences. Behavioral data indicate listeners collect statistical estimates to process incoming sounds, and a perceptual model based on Bayesian inference shows a capacity in the brain to track higher-order statistics. Further analysis of individual subjects’ behavior indicates an important role of perceptual constraints in listeners’ ability to track these sensory statistics with high fidelity. In addition, the inference model facilitates analysis of neural electroencephalography (EEG) responses, anchoring the analysis relative to the statistics of each stochastic stimulus. This reveals both a deviance response and a change-related disruption in phase of the stimulus-locked response that follow the higher-order statistics. These results shed light on the brain’s ability to process stochastic sound sequences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ROlsYNEAxXQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163acfd731a:122df8:ed160cc3</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Skerritt-Davis, Mounya Elhilali&lt;/p&gt;

Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase which plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulation of genes involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, invasion and self-renewal. Activity and biological function of EZH2 are regulated by posttranslational modifications. It is suggested that EZH2 stability may be regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which is an enzyme catalyzing the addition of GlcNAc moieties to target proteins. In this study, we determined the impact of OGT on expression of EZH2 target genes &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt;, that are involved in breast cancer progression. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both EZH2 and OGT are targeted to the promoter regions of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; and knockdown of EZH2 or OGT affects expression of studied genes in breast non-malignant (MCF10A) and cancer cells (MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231). The results showed that OGT silencing affects EZH2 binding to &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; promoter but the effect is cell-context dependent. Despite the slight decrease in EZH2 protein level in cells with OGT depletion, EZH2 binding to &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; was increased. Moreover, OGT binding to promoter regions of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; was increased in cells with knockdown of EZH2. Increased expression of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; in cells with OGT deregulation was associated with increased acetylation level of histone H3.

Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8e:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yui K.

NANOG has been demonstrated to play an essential role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, and its pseudogene, NANOGP8, is suggested to promote the cancer stem cell phenotype. As the roles of these genes are intimately involved with glioblastoma multiforme progression and exosomes are critical in intercellular communication, we conducted a detailed analysis of the association of the NANOG gene family with exosomes to identify diagnostic markers for cancer. Exosomes were precipitated from conditioned culture media from various cell lines, and NANOG gene fragments were directly amplified without DNA isolation using multiple primer sets. The use of the enzymes AlwNI and SmaI with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis functioned to distinguish NANOGP8 from other NANOG family members. Collectively, results suggest that the NANOG DNA associated with exosomes is not full length and that mixed populations of the NANOG gene family exist. Furthermore, sequence analysis of exosomal DNA amplified with a NANOGP8 specific primer set frequently showed an insertion of a 22 bp sequence into the 3’ UTR. The occurrence rate of this insertion was significantly higher in exosomal DNA clones from cancer cells as compared to normal cells. We have detected mixed populations of NANOG DNA associated with exosomes and have identified preferential modulations in the sequences from cancer samples. Our findings, coupled with the properties of exosomes, may allow for the detection of traditionally inaccessible cancers (i.e. GBM) through minimally invasive techniques. Further analysis of exosomal DNA sequences of NANOG and other embryonic stemness genes (OCT3/4, SOX2, etc.) may establish a robust collection of exosome based diagnostic markers, and further elucidate the mechanisms of cancer formation, progression, and metastasis.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406b:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Manjusha Vaidya, Michael Bacchus, Kiminobu Sugaya&lt;/p&gt;

Further analysis of exosomal DNA sequences of NANOG and other embryonic stemness genes (OCT3/4, SOX2, etc.) may establish a robust collection of exosome based diagnostic markers, and further elucidate the mechanisms of cancer formation, progression, and metastasis.</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302737v2?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302737v2?rss=1</originId><author><name>Celik, S.</name></author><crawled>1526758538458</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302737v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>a9e3218e</fingerprint><published>1526713200000</published><title>A probabilistic approach to using big data reveals Complex I as a potential Alzheimer&apos;s disease therapeutic target [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/19/302737</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Identifying gene expression markers for Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) neuropathology through meta-analysis is a complex undertaking because available data are often from different studies and/or brain regions involving study-specific confounders and/or region-specific biological processes.

Background &lt;p&gt;Maternal nutrition during pregnancy has been related to intrauterine brain development and neurodevelopmental disabilities in adult life. We aim to investigate associations between periconceptional maternal dietary patterns and prenatal cerebellar growth from the first trimester onwards.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;126 women with singleton non-malformed pregnancies were enrolled before 8 weeks of gestation in the Rotterdam periconceptional cohort between 2013 and 2015. Periconceptional maternal dietary patterns were extracted from food frequency questionnaires and associated with blood biomarkers and micronutrient intakes. Serial two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasound scans were performed at 9, 11, 22, 26 and 32 weeks of gestation for transcerebellar diameter (TCD) measurement. Linear mixed models were estimated to investigate associations between periconceptional maternal dietary patterns and longitudinal TCD measurements as a function of gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We performed a median of 4 scans per pregnancy, resulting in 570 total datasets. The success rate of TCD measurements was 87% (range 65–100%), depending on gestational age. The Mediterranean, Western, egg-rich and dairy-rich dietary patterns were extracted, explaining 37.2% of the overall variance of food intake in this population. The dairy-rich dietary pattern was positively associated with cerebellar growth trajectories (β = 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01; 0.03) √mm, p = 0.01). Maternal strong adherence to this dietary pattern increased TCD measurements by 0.8 standard deviation scores (SDs) compared to weak adherence, reflected in increased TCD estimates of 0.44 mm at 9 weeks (+6.8%), 0.88 mm at 22 weeks (+3.6%), and 1.17 mm at 32 weeks (+2.8%). No significant associations were detected for the Mediterranean, Western and egg-rich dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study shows a positive association between periconceptional maternal adherence to a dairy-rich dietary pattern and human prenatal TCD measurements as a proxy of cerebellar growth.

Phosphoinositide (PtdInsP) lipids recruit effector proteins to membranes to mediate a variety of functions including signal transduction and membrane trafficking. Each PtdInsP binds to a specific set of effectors through characteristic protein domains such as the PH, FYVE and PX domains. Domains with high affinity for a single PtdInsP species are useful as probes to visualize the distribution and dynamics of that PtdInsP. The endolysosomal system is governed by two primary PtdInsPs: phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], which are thought to localize and control early endosomes and lysosomes/late endosomes, respectively. While PtdIns(3)P has been analysed with mammalian-derived PX and FYVE domains, PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; indicators remain controversial. Thus, complementary probes against these PtdInsPs are needed, including those originating from non-mammalian proteins. Here, we characterized in mammalian cells the dynamics of the PH domain from PH-containing protein-1 from the parasite &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; (TgPH1), which was previously shown to bind PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, we show that TgPH1 retains membrane-binding in PIKfyve-inhibited cells, suggesting that TgPH1 is not a viable PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; marker in mammalian cells. Instead, PtdIns(3)P depletion using pharmacological and enzyme-based assays dissociated TgPH1 from membranes. Indeed, TgPH1 co-localized with Rab5-positive early endosomes. In addition, TgPH1 co-localized and behaved similarly to the PX domain of p40phox and FYVE domain of EEA1, which are commonly used as PtdIns(3)P indicators. Collectively, TgPH1 offers a complementary reporter for PtdIns(3)P derived from a non-mammalian protein and that is distinct from commonly employed PX and FYVE domain-based probes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bcc:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Krishna Chintaluri, Brady D.

Ischemic stroke remains an important cause of disability and mortality. Hypertension is a critical risk factor for the development of ischemic stroke. Control of risk factors, including hypertension, is therefore important for the prevention of ischemic stroke. Linalyl acetate (LA) has been reported to have therapeutic effects in ischemic stroke by modulating intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and having anti-oxidative properties. The preventive efficacy of LA has not yet been determined. This study therefore investigated the preventive efficacy of LA in rat aortas exposed to hypertension related-ischemic injury, and the mechanism of action of LA.Hypertension was induced &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; following ischemic injury to the aorta induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Effects of LA were assayed by western blotting, by determining concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by vascular contractility assays. LA significantly reduced systolic blood pressure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, LA suppressed ischemic injury-induced expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit p47&lt;sup&gt;phox&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as ROS production, LDH release, and ROS-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase suppression. These findings indicate that LA has anti-hypertensive properties that can prevent hypertension-related ischemic injury and can prevent NADPH oxidase-induced production of ROS.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd84:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Shan Hsieh, Soonho Kwon, Hui Su Lee, Geun Hee Seol&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aims of the study were to identify the associations between multimorbidity and specific physical function domains among community-dwelling adults in Singapore, and to examine sex differences in the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted using baseline data of 1,940 participants in the Population Health Index Survey conducted in the Central Region of Singapore from November 2015 to November 2016. Physical function was assessed using the Function Component of the Late-life Function and Disability Instrument and compared between men and women. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine associations between multimorbidity and different physical function domains for all participants, and in men and women separately.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of multimorbidity in the study population was 35.0% for adults aged 21 years and above, with no differences between men and women. Multimorbidity was associated with reduced upper extremity function, basic and advanced lower extremity function, and overall function in men and women after adjusting for demographic factors. Multimorbidity had a stronger association with advanced lower extremity function and overall physical function in women than in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings of this study indicate that multimorbidity is associated with physical function domains in men and women, and in particular advanced lower extremity for women. Effective community-based interventions need to be implemented to preserve physical function in individuals with multimorbidity to keep them functionally independent and physically active in the community. Additional focus on advanced lower extremity function for women is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a21a4:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lixia Ge, Chun Wei Yap, Bee Hoon Heng&lt;/p&gt;

The main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a 12-week water aerobics program in a real-life context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults. Fifteen volunteers (58.80 ± 14.32 years old) were part of an experimental group (Exercise), and eight volunteers (59.00 ± 12.26 years old) were part of the control group (Control). The Exercise performed 45 min of water aerobics twice a week for 12 weeks; no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period. The evaluations were performed the week before (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry, lipid profile and blood pressure. Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in post-training moment. However, there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced body fat (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced systolic blood pressure (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.14) and triglycerides (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19) in Exercise. Within groups changes showed that the training program caused an increase mainly in explosive strength in the upper limbs (0.26 m, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.49; ES = 0.63) In addition, there was a significant decrease in fat mass (-0.89%, 95% CI, -1.74, -0.03; ES = 0.61) and in the systolic blood pressure (-0.83 mmHg, -1.46, -0.19; ES = 0.71). Nonetheless, no significant changes were observed for the lipid profile. These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b94f:7cfe07d6</id><engagementRate>52.0</engagementRate><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Henrique Pereira Neiva, Luís Brandão Faíl, Mikel Izquierdo, Mário C.

A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate and improve the “late-night dining” options in a university dining hall. Surveys assessed student desires for late-night offerings, and evaluated students’ habits and motivations during late-night dining. Two interventions were implemented to see if students could be “nudged” into different choice patterns. In the first, a “veggie-heavy” entrée was added at the beginning of the entrée line, so that students would substitute an entrée containing vegetables for the alternatives. In the second, a snack-food bar was set up to cater to students who didn’t want to stand in the long entrée line, and preferred a snack. Data on food choice was collected during the interventions. Survey responses showed significant differences in the reasons females and males utilized late-night dining (p&amp;lt;0.001). We also found that students at late-night dining had a lower emphasis on health than the general student population. Even students at late-night who reported being health-conscious showed no difference in food selections from students who said health was not important (p = 0.883). Veggie-heavy entrées had mild success in increasing vegetable selection. However, veggie-heavy entrées were largely ignored when the other option was chicken nuggets. The snack bar was very popular. Entrée placement and convenience lines may have mild impacts on food selection in a late-night dining environment.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b946:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Bevet, Meredith T.

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses. Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f69:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alfred Obia, Jan Mulder, Sarah Elizabeth Hale, Neneng Laela Nurida, Gerard Cornelissen&lt;/p&gt;

The search for general properties in network structure has been a central issue for food web studies in recent years. One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c2c:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomás Ignacio Marina, Leonardo A.

True estimation of the contribution of proteasome-spliced peptides (PSPs) to the global Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) ligandome is critical. A recent study suggested that PSPs contribute up to 30% of the HLA ligandome.

To better estimate the actual number of PSPs, we present an alternative workflow. We performed de-novo sequencing of the HLA-peptide spectra and discarded all de-novo sequences found in the UniProt database. We checked whether the remaining de-novo sequences could match spliced peptides from human proteins. The spliced sequences were appended to the UniProt fasta file, which was searched by two search tools at a FDR of 1%. We find that maximally 2-4% of the HLA ligandome could be explained as spliced protein fragments. The majority of these potential PSPs have good peptide-spectrum match properties and are predicted to bind the respective HLA molecules.

The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ea:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ruben D.

Since the accuracies of the ZMM have been revealed to be sufficient in previous studies, it is highly desirable to clarify its practical performance. In this paper, the performance of the ZMM is compared with that of the smooth particle mesh Ewald method (SPME), where the both methods are implemented in molecular dynamics software package GROMACS. Extensive performance comparisons against a highly optimized, parameter‐tuned SPME implementation are performed for various‐sized water systems and two protein–water systems. We analyze in detail the dependence of the performance on the potential parameters and the number of CPU cores. Even though the ZMM uses a larger cutoff distance than the SPME does, the performance of the ZMM is comparable to or better than that of the SPME. This is because the ZMM does not require a time‐consuming electrostatic convolution and because the ZMM gains short neighbor‐list distances due to the smooth damping feature of the pairwise potential function near the cutoff length.

A prime example of such a question is enrichment of gene ontology (GO) classes in lists of genes. Our paper deals with two issues within this larger question. One is how to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) within a set of apparently enriched ontologies, and the second how to set that FDR within the context of assessing significance for addressing biological questions, to answer these questions we compare a random resampling method with a commonly used method for assessing FDR, the Benjamini Hochberg (BH) method.

Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment promotes glioma progression. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans appear in the ECM and on the cell surface, and can be catalyzed by dermatan sulfate epimerase to form chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) hybrid chains. Dermatan sulfate epimerase 1 (DSE) is overexpressed in many types of cancer, and CS/DS chains mediate several growth factor signals. However, the role of DSE in gliomas has never been explored. In the present study, we determined the expression of DSE in gliomas by consulting a public database and conducting immunohistochemistry on a tissue array. Our investigation revealed that DSE was upregulated in gliomas compared with normal brain tissue. Furthermore, high DSE expression was associated with advanced tumor grade and poor survival. We found high DSE expression in several glioblastoma cell lines, and DSE expression directly mediated DS chain formation in glioblastoma cells. Knockdown of DSE suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioblastoma cells. In contrast, overexpression of DSE in GL261 cells enhanced these malignant phenotypes and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tumor growth. Interestingly, we found that DSE selectively regulated heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)-induced signaling in glioblastoma cells. Inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 with afatinib suppressed DSE-enhanced malignant phenotypes, establishing the critical role of the ErbB pathway in regulating the effects of DSE expression. This evidence indicates that upregulation of DSE in gliomas contributes to malignant behavior in cancer cells. We provide novel insight into the significance of DS chains in ErbB signaling and glioma pathogenesis.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b78b:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Chieh Liao, Chih-Kai Liao, You-Huan Tsai, To-Jung Tseng, Li-Ching Chuang, Chyn-Tair Lan, Hung-Ming Chang, Chiung-Hui Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Bayesian phylogenetic approaches can take advantage of these data by simultaneously inferring the phylogenetic tree, evolutionary timescale, and demographic parameters (such as population growth rates), while naturally integrating uncertainty in all parameters.

The calculated activation barrier is 16 kcal/mol in agreement with the experimental evidence. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1639679584a:2569b7:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5338.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5338.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>Lu Zheng, Hui Dong, Xiaoyu Wu, Yen-Lin Huang, Wenbo Wang, Weida Wu, Zheng Wang, Keji Lai</name></author><crawled>1527009159129</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5338.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>75ee9012</fingerprint><published>1527005192000</published><title>Interferometric imaging of nonlocal electromechanical power transduction in ferroelectric domains [Applied Physical Sciences]</title><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5338</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>The electrical generation and detection of elastic waves are the foundation for acoustoelectronic and acoustooptic systems.

However, one challenge in accurately characterizing microbial communities is exogenous bacterial DNA contamination. This is particularly problematic for sites of low microbial biomass such as the urinary tract, placenta, and lower airway. Computational approaches have been proposed as a post-processing step to identify and remove potential contaminants, but their performance has not been independently evaluated. To identify the impact of decreasing microbial biomass on polymicrobial 16S rRNA gene sequencing experiments, we used a serial dilution of a mock microbial community. We evaluated two computational approaches to identify and remove contaminants: 1) identifying sequences that have an inverse correlation with DNA concentration implemented in Decontam and 2) predicting the proportion of experimental sample arising from defined contaminant sources implemented in SourceTracker. Results: As expected, the proportion of contaminant bacterial DNA increased with decreasing starting microbial biomass, with 79.12% of the most dilute sample arising from contaminant sequences. Inclusion of contaminant sequences in analyses leads to overinflated diversity estimates (up to 12 times greater than the expected values) and distorts microbiome composition. SourceTracker successfully removed over 98% of contaminants when the experimental environments are well defined. However, SourceTracker performed poorly when the experimental environment is unknown, failing to remove the majority of contaminants. Decontam successfully removed 74 - 91% of contaminants regardless of prior knowledge of the experimental environment. Conclusions: Our study indicates that computational methods can reduce the amount of contaminants in 16S rRNA gene sequencing experiments. The appropriate computational approach for removing contaminant sequences from an experiment depends on the prior knowledge about the microbial environment under investigation and can be evaluated with a dilution series of a mock microbial community.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16397a19bc8:459994:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Microbial communities are commonly studied using culture-independent methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559157:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cuiying Song, Wei Guan, Jihui Ma&lt;/p&gt;

Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods. Results: We extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, the newly methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods.

However, because of the variability of this gene, it has been difficult to design good universal PCR primers. Most primers used today are associated with gaps in the taxonomic coverage or amplification biases that make the results less reliable and impede the detection of species that are present in the sample. We identify new primers for insect metabarcoding using computational approaches (ECOPRIMERS and DEGEPRIME) applied to the most comprehensive reference databases of mitochondrial genomes of Hexapoda assembled to date. New primers are evaluated in silico against previously published primers in terms of taxonomic coverage and resolution of the corresponding amplicons. For the latter criterion, we propose a new index, exclusive taxonomic resolution, which is a more biologically meaningful measure than the standard index used today. Our results show that the best markers are found in the ribosomal RNA genes (12S and 16S); they resolve about 90% of the genetically distinct species in the reference database. Some markers in protein-coding genes provide similar performance but only at much higher levels of primer degeneracy. Combining two of the best individual markers improves the effective taxonomic resolution with up to 10%. The resolution is strongly dependent on insect taxon: COI primers detect 40% of Hymenoptera, while 12S primers detect 12% of Collembola. Our results indicate that amplicon-based metabarcoding of insect samples can be improved by choosing other primers than those commonly used today.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163738c2f85:527ab9d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Insect metabarcoding has been mainly based on PCR amplification of short fragments within the &apos;barcoding region&apos; of the gene COI.

Cities around the world are inundated by cars and suffer traffic congestion that results in excess delays, reduced safety and environmental pollution. The interplay between road infrastructure and travel choices defines the level and the spatio-temporal extent of congestion. Given the existing infrastructure, understanding how the route choice decisions are made and how travellers interact with each other is a crucial first step in mitigating traffic congestion. This is a problem with fundamental importance, as it has implications for other limited supply systems where agents compete for resources and reach an equilibrium. Here, we observe the route choice decisions and the traffic conditions through an extensive data set of GPS trajectories. We compare the actual paths followed by travellers to those implied by equilibrium conditions (i) at a microscopic scale, where we focus on individual path similarities, and (ii) at a macroscopic scale, where we perform network-level comparison of the traffic loads. We present that non-cooperative or selfish equilibrium replicates the actual traffic (to a certain extent) at the macroscopic scale, while the majority of individual decisions cannot be reproduced by neither selfish nor cooperative equilibrium models.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42265:5785ab88</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mehmet Yildirimoglu, Osman Kahraman&lt;/p&gt;

Recent experiments have demonstrated that visual cortex engages in spatio-temporal sequence learning and prediction. The cellular basis of this learning remains unclear, however. Here we present a spiking neural network model that explains a recent study on sequence learning in the primary visual cortex of rats. The model posits that the sequence learning and prediction abilities of cortical circuits result from the interaction of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. It also reproduces changes in stimulus-evoked multi-unit activity during learning. Furthermore, it makes precise predictions regarding how training shapes network connectivity to establish its prediction ability. Finally, it predicts that the adapted connectivity gives rise to systematic changes in spontaneous network activity. Taken together, our model establishes a new conceptual bridge between the structure and function of cortical circuits in the context of sequence learning and prediction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zOLtDY7_1Wk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163d10f9584:14e7082:a96d255</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Klos, Daniel Miner, Jochen Triesch&lt;/p&gt;

Jill E.Gready</name></author><crawled>1526330805274</crawled><description>Here, we describe a computational approach for studying enzymes that catalyze complex multi‐step reactions and apply it to Ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme that fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide within photosynthesis. In the 5‐step carboxylase reaction, the substrate Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP) first binds Rubisco and undergoes enolization before binding the second substrate, CO2. Hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex is followed by CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation. However, details of the roles and protonation states of active‐site residues, and sources of protons and water, remain highly speculative. Large‐scale computations on active‐site models provide a means to better understand this complex chemical mechanism. The computational protocol comprises a combination of hybrid semi‐empirical quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics within constrained molecular dynamics simulations, together with constrained gradient minimization calculations using density functional theory. Alternative pathways for hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex and associated active‐site protonation networks and proton and water sources were investigated. The main findings from analysis of the resulting energetics advocate major revision to existing mechanisms such that: hydration takes place anti to the CO2; both hydration and CC bond scission require early protonation of CO2 in the RuBP.CO2 complex; CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation reactions are concerted and, effectively, there is only one stable intermediate, the C3‐gemdiolate complex. Our main conclusions for interpreting enzyme kinetic results are that the gemdiolate may represent the elusive Michaelis–Menten‐like complex corresponding to the empirical Km (=Kc) with turnover to product via bond scission concerted with stereospecific protonation consistent with the observed catalytic rate. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25343?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>60a40e84</fingerprint><published>1526281661000</published><title>Revised mechanism of carboxylation of ribulose‐1,5‐biphosphate by rubisco from large scale quantum chemical calculations</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here, we describe a computational approach for studying enzymes that catalyze complex multi‐step reactions and apply it to Ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme that fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide within photosynthesis.

Because most human B cell lymphomas originate from GC B cells or B cells that have undergone the GC response, our data suggest that R-Ras2 may also regulate metabolism in B cell malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00017</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00017</originId><author><name>Zachary Ridgway, Xiaoxue Zhang, Amy G.

REEs in the environment can be absorbed by plants and sequestered by plant phytoliths. Acid rain can directly or indirectly affect plant physiological functions. Currently, the effects of REEs and acid rain on phytolith-REEs complex in plants are not yet fully understood. In this study, a high-silicon accumulation crop, rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.), was selected as a representative of plants, and orthogonal experiments were conducted under various levels of lanthanum [La(III)] and pH. The results showed that various La(III) concentrations could significantly improve the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III) in germinated rice seeds. A pH of 4.5 promoted phytolith La(III) sequestration, while a pH of 3.5 inhibited sequestration. Compared with the single treatment with La(III), the combination of La(III) and acid rain inhibited the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III). Correlation analysis showed that the efficiency of phytolith La(III) sequestration had no correlation with the production of phytolith but was closely correlated with the sequestration of phytolith La(III) and the physiological changes of germinated rice seeds. Phytolith morphology was an important factor affecting phytolith La(III) sequestration in germinated rice seeds, and the effect of tubes on sequestration was more significant than that of dumbbells. This study demonstrated that the formation of the phytolith and La(III) complex could be affected by exogenous La(III) and acid rain in germinated rice seeds.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b83:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yong Si, Lihong Wang, Qing Zhou, Xiaohua Huang&lt;/p&gt;

For about 70 years, L-glucose had been considered non-metabolizable by either mammalian or bacterial cells. Recently, however, an L-glucose catabolic pathway has been discovered in &lt;i&gt;Paracoccus laeviglucosivorans&lt;/i&gt;, and the genes responsible cloned. &lt;i&gt;Scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase is involved in the first step in the pathway that oxidizes L-glucose to produce L-glucono-1,5-lactone with concomitant reduction of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent manner. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex of &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and L-glucono-1,5-lactone at 1.8 Å resolution. The enzyme adopts a homo-tetrameric structure, similar to those of the inositol dehydrogenase family, and the electron densities of the bound sugar was clearly observed, allowing identification of the residues responsible for interaction with the substrate in the catalytic site. In addition to the conserved catalytic residues (Lys106, Asp191, and His195), another residue, His318, located in the loop region of the adjacent subunit, is involved in substrate recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of these residues in catalytic activity. We also report the complex structures of the enzyme with &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol and &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inosose. The Arg178 residue located in the flexible loop at the entrance of the catalytic site is also involved in substrate recognition, and plays an important role in accepting both L-glucose and inositols as substrates. On the basis of these structural features, which have not been identified in the known inositol dehydrogenases, and a phylogenetic analysis of IDH family enzymes, we suggest a novel subfamily of the GFO/IDH/MocA family.

Recently, however, an L-glucose catabolic pathway has been discovered in &lt;i&gt;Paracoccus laeviglucosivorans&lt;/i&gt;, and the genes responsible cloned. &lt;i&gt;Scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase is involved in the first step in the pathway that oxidizes L-glucose to produce L-glucono-1,5-lactone with concomitant reduction of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent manner. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex of &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and L-glucono-1,5-lactone at 1.8 Å resolution. The enzyme adopts a homo-tetrameric structure, similar to those of the inositol dehydrogenase family, and the electron densities of the bound sugar was clearly observed, allowing identification of the residues responsible for interaction with the substrate in the catalytic site. In addition to the conserved catalytic residues (Lys106, Asp191, and His195), another residue, His318, located in the loop region of the adjacent subunit, is involved in substrate recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of these residues in catalytic activity. We also report the complex structures of the enzyme with &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol and &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inosose. The Arg178 residue located in the flexible loop at the entrance of the catalytic site is also involved in substrate recognition, and plays an important role in accepting both L-glucose and inositols as substrates. On the basis of these structural features, which have not been identified in the known inositol dehydrogenases, and a phylogenetic analysis of IDH family enzymes, we suggest a novel subfamily of the GFO/IDH/MocA family. Since many enzymes in this family have not biochemically characterized, our results could promote to find their activities with various substrates.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198318</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198318</originId><author><name>Matthew K.

We determined the filtered tree species pool of Amazonian wetland forests, based on confirmed occurrence records, to better understand how tree diversity in wetland environments compares to tree diversity in the entire Amazon region. The tree species pool was determined using data from two main sources: 1) a compilation of published tree species lists plus one unpublished list of our own, derived from tree plot inventories and floristic surveys; 2) queries on botanical collections that include Amazonian flora, curated by herbaria and available through the SpeciesLink digital biodiversity database. We applied taxonomic name resolution and determined sample-based species accumulation curves for both datasets, to estimate sampling effort and predict the expected species richness using Chao’s analytical estimators. We report a total of 3 615 valid tree species occurring in Amazonian wetland forests. After surveying almost 70 years of research efforts to inventory the diversity of Amazonian wetland trees, we found that 74% these records were registered in published species lists (2 688 tree species). Tree species richness estimates predicted from either single dataset underestimated the total pooled species richness recorded as occurring in Amazonian wetlands, with only 41% of the species shared by both datasets. The filtered tree species pool of Amazonian wetland forests comprises 53% of the 6 727 tree species taxonomically confirmed for the Amazonian tree flora to date. This large proportion is likely to be the result of significant species interchange among forest habitats within the Amazon region, as well as &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; speciation processes due to strong ecological filtering. The provided tree species pool raises the number of tree species previously reported as occurring in Amazonian wetlands by a factor of 3.2.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c20:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Garcia Luize, José Leonardo Lima Magalhães, Helder Queiroz, Maria Aparecida Lopes, Eduardo Martins Venticinque, Evlyn Márcia Leão de Moraes Novo, Thiago Sanna Freire Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize the conserved molecular patterns in microorganisms and trigger myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and/or TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) pathways that are critical for host defense against microbial infection. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern TLR signaling remain incompletely understood. Regulator of calcineurin-1 (RCAN1), a small evolutionarily conserved protein that inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity, suppresses inflammation during &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; infection. Here, we define the roles for RCAN1 in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated TLR4 signaling. We compared the effects of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; LPS challenge on bone marrow-derived macrophages from both wild-type and RCAN1-deficient mice and found that RCAN1 deficiency increased the MyD88-NF-κB-mediated cytokine production (IL-6, TNF and MIP-2), whereas TRIF-interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE)-mediated cytokine production (IFNβ, RANTES and IP-10) was suppressed. RCAN1 deficiency caused increased IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activity in the MyD88-dependent pathway, but impaired ISRE activation and reduced IRF7 expression in the TRIF-dependent pathway. Complementary studies of a mouse model of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; LPS-induced acute pneumonia confirmed that RCAN1-deficient mice displayed greatly enhanced NF-κB activity and MyD88-NF-κB-mediated cytokine production, which correlated with enhanced pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils. By contrast, RCAN1 deficiency had little effect on the TRIF pathway &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings demonstrate a novel regulatory role of RCAN1 in TLR signaling, which differentially regulates MyD88 and TRIF pathways.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd6b:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zheng Pang, Robert D.

Q fever vaccine uptake among veterinary nurses in Australia is low, suggesting veterinarians are not recommending the vaccination to veterinary personnel. This study aimed to determine the willingness of veterinarians to recommend Q fever vaccination to veterinary personnel and to identify factors influencing Q fever vaccine uptake by veterinary nurses in Australia. An online cross sectional survey targeted veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia in 2014. Responses were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Factors significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with a willingness to recommend the vaccination, expressed by 35% (95% CI 31–38%) of veterinarians (n = 828), were (1) being very concerned for colleagues regarding &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; (OR 4.73), (2) disagreeing the vaccine is harmful (OR 3.80), (3) high Q fever knowledge (OR 2.27), (4) working within small animal practice (OR 1.67), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.55), and (6) age, with veterinarians under 39 years most likely to recommend vaccination. Of the veterinary nursing cohort who reported a known Q fever vaccination status (n = 688), 29% (95% CI 26–33%) had sought vaccination. This was significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with (1) agreeing the vaccine is important (OR 8.34), (2) moderate/high Q fever knowledge (OR 5.51), (3) working in Queensland (OR 4.00), (4) working within livestock/mixed animal practice (OR 3.24), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.86), (6) strong reliance on work culture for biosecurity information (OR 2.5), (7) perceiving personal exposure to &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; to be at least low/moderate (OR 2.14), and (8) both agreeing the vaccine is safe and working within a corporate practice structure (OR 4.28). The study identified the need for veterinarians to take greater responsibility for workplace health and safety promotion, and calls for better education of veterinary personnel to raise awareness of the potential for occupational exposure to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burnetii&lt;/i&gt; and improve the perception of the Q fever vaccine as being important, safe and cost-effective.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf3:3dd877af</id><engagementRate>12.0</engagementRate><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emily Sellens, Jacqueline M.

This was significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with (1) agreeing the vaccine is important (OR 8.34), (2) moderate/high Q fever knowledge (OR 5.51), (3) working in Queensland (OR 4.00), (4) working within livestock/mixed animal practice (OR 3.24), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.86), (6) strong reliance on work culture for biosecurity information (OR 2.5), (7) perceiving personal exposure to &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; to be at least low/moderate (OR 2.14), and (8) both agreeing the vaccine is safe and working within a corporate practice structure (OR 4.28). The study identified the need for veterinarians to take greater responsibility for workplace health and safety promotion, and calls for better education of veterinary personnel to raise awareness of the potential for occupational exposure to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burnetii&lt;/i&gt; and improve the perception of the Q fever vaccine as being important, safe and cost-effective.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04516-x</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04516-x</originId><author><name>Lisa C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Transgender persons are highly victimized, marginalized, disproportionately experience incarceration, and have alarmingly increased rates of HIV infection compared to cis-gender persons. Few studies have examined the HIV care continuum outcomes among transgender women (TW), particularly TW who are involved with the criminal justice (CJ) system.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To improve our understanding of HIV care continuum outcomes and risk behaviors among HIV-infected TW who are involved with the CJ system, we analyzed data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse-supported Seek, Test, Treat, Retain (STTR) Data Harmonization Initiative. Baseline data were pooled and analyzed from three U.S. STTR studies to examine HIV risk and care continuum indicators among CJ-involved HIV-infected TW compared to cisgender men (CM), matched on age (within 5 years) and study at a ratio of 1:5.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighty-eight TW and 440 CM were included in the study. Among matched participants, TW were more likely to report crack and cocaine use compared to CM (40%,16% respectively, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001); both TW and CM reported high rates of condomless sex (58%, 64%, respectively); TW were more likely than CM to have more than one sexual partner (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6, 5.2; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and have engaged in exchange sex (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 2.3, 6.6; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were no significant differences between TW and CM in the percentage currently taking ART (52%, 49%, respectively), the mean percent adherence to ART (77% for both groups), and the proportion who achieved viral suppression (61%, 58%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;HIV-infected CJ-involved TW and CM had similar use of ART and viral suppression but TW were more likely than matched CM to engage in exchange sex, have multiple sexual partners, and use crack/cocaine. TW and CM had similarly high rates of condomless sex and use of other drugs. TW require tailored risk reduction interventions, however both CJ-involved TW and CM require focused attention to reduce HIV risk and improve HIV continuum of care outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094064:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Curt G.

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of phosphorus (P) restriction on the deleterious effects of high fat diets on mineral metabolism. Twenty-four rats were allotted to 3 groups (n = 8 each) that were fed different diets for 7 months. Rats in group 1 were fed normal fat-normal P (0.6%) diet (NF-NP), rats in group 2 were fed high fat- normal P diet (HF-NP) and rats in group 3 were fed high fat-low P (0.2%) diet (HF-LP). Blood, urine and tissues were collected at the end of the experiments. When compared with the control group (NF-NP), rats fed HF diets showed increases in body weight, and in plasma concentrations of triglycerides and leptin, and decreased plasma calcitriol concentrations. In rats fed HF-NP plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was higher (279.6±39.4 pg/ml vs 160.6±25.0 pg/ml, p = 0.018) and renal klotho (ratio klotho/GAPDH) was lower (0.75±0.06 vs 1.06±0.08, p&amp;lt;0.01) than in rats fed NF-NP. Phosphorus restriction did not normalize plasma FGF23 or renal klotho; in fact, rats fed HF-LP, that only ingested an average of 22.9 mg/day of P, had higher FGF23 (214.7±32.4 pg/ml) concentrations than rats fed NF-NP (160.6±25.0 pg/ml), that ingested and average of 74.4 mg/day of P over a 7 month period. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that severe P restriction over a prolonged period of time (7 months) does not normalize the increase in circulating FGF23 induced by HF diets. These data indicate that the deleterious effects of high fat diet on the FGF23/klotho axis are not eliminated by reduced P intake.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84556:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Rios, Carmen Pineda, Ignacio Lopez, Juan Muñoz-Castañeda, Mariano Rodriguez, Escolastico Aguilera-Tejero, Ana I.

Background &lt;p&gt;Up to 25% of acute stroke patients first note symptoms upon awakening. We hypothesized that patients awaking with stroke symptoms may be safely treated with intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) using non-contrast head CT (NCHCT), if they meet all other standard criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The SAfety of Intravenous thromboLytics in stroke ON awakening (SAIL ON) was a prospective, open-label, single treatment arm, pilot safety trial of standard dose IV tPA in patients who presented with stroke symptoms within 0–4.5 hours of awakening. From January 30, 2013, to September 1, 2015, twenty consecutive wakeup stroke patients selected by NCHCT were enrolled. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in the first 36 hours. Secondary outcomes included NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours; and modified Rankin Score (mRS), NIHSS, and Barthel index at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The average age was 65 years (range 47–83); 40% were women; 50% were African American. The average NIHSS was 6 (range 4–11). The average time from wake-up to IV tPA was 205 minutes (range 114–270). The average time from last known well to IV tPA was 580 minutes (range 353–876). The median mRS at 90 days was 1 (range 0–5). No patients had sICH; two of 20 (10%) had asymptomatic ICH on routine post IV tPA brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Administration of IV tPA was feasible and may be safe in wakeup stroke patients presenting within 4.5 hours from awakening, screened with NCHCT. An adequately powered randomized clinical trial is needed.&lt;/p&gt; Clinical trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01643902.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094062:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Victor C.

We previously demonstrated that ME-Class, which uses a high-resolution model of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, is an effective tool to understand relationships between 5mC and expression.

Using ME-Class2 we analyze whole-genome single-base resolution 5mC and 5hmC datasets from 20 primary tissue and cell samples to uncover relationships between 5hmC and expression. The addition of 5hmC improves model performance for tissues with high-levels of 5hmC such as the brain. Our analysis further indicates that conversion of 5mC to 5hmC within 2kb of the transcription start site associates with distinct functions depending on the summed level of 5mC + 5hmC. Unchanged levels of 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. conversion from 5mC to stable 5hmC) associate with repression. Meanwhile, decreases in 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. 5hmC-mediated demethylation) associate with gene activation. As more large-scale, genome-wide, differential DNA methylation studies become available, tools such as ME-Class2 will prove invaluable to interpret epigenomic data and guide mechanistic studies into the function of 5hmC.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1634a7e4804:142267f:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Since the discovery of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) as a prominent DNA base modification found in mammalian genomes, an emergent question has been what role this mark plays in gene regulation. 5hmC is hypothesized to function as an intermediate in the demethylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and also in reactivation of silenced regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancers.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adults. People with OSAS have a higher risk of experiencing traffic accidents and occupational injuries (OIs). We aimed to clarify the diagnostic performance of a three-channel screening device (ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with the gold standard of full-night attended polysomnography (PSG) among hospital outpatients not referred for sleep-related symptoms. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether manual revision of the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore enhanced diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We investigated 68 patients with OI and 44 without OI recruited from the University Hospital Basel emergency room, using a cross-sectional study design. Participating patients spent one night at home with ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and within 2 weeks slept for one night at the sleep laboratory. We reanalyzed all ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; data after manual revision.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified significant correlations between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) autoscore and the AHI derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.525; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) autoscore and that derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.722; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore showed a sensitivity and specificity of 82% when comparing AHI ≥5 with the cutoff for AHI and/or ODI ≥15 from PSG. In Bland Altman plots the mean difference between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore and PSG was 2.75 with SD ± 8.80 (β = 0.034), and between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI revised score and PSG -1.50 with SD ± 9.28 (β = 0.060).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity compared with the gold standard (full-night attended PSG). However, Bland Altman plots revealed substantial fluctuations between PSG and ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore respectively manually revised score. This spread for the AHI from a clinical perspective is large, and therefore the results have to be interpreted with caution.

A new set of efficient solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force fields was developed for phospholipids and peptides. To enhance transferability, this model maps around four heavy atoms and their connected hydrogen atoms into a coarse-grained elementary bead based on functional group. The effective hybrid potential between any pair of beads is composed of a short-range repulsive soft-core potential that directly adopts the form of an explicit-solvent DPD model and a long-range attractive hydrophobic potential. The parameters of the attractive potentials for lipid molecules were obtained by fitting the explicit-solvent DPD simulation of one bead of any type in a water box, then finely tuning it until the bilayer membrane properties obtained in the explicit-solvent model were matched. These parameters were further extended to amino acids according to bead type. The structural and elastic properties of bilayer membranes, free energy profiles for a lipid flip-flop and amino acid analogues translocating across the membrane, and membrane pore formation induced by antimicrobial peptides obtained from this solvent-free DPD force field considerably agreed with the explicit-solvent DPD results. Importantly, the efficiency of this method is guaranteed to accelerate the assembly of vesicles composed of several thousand lipids by up to 50-fold, rendering the experimental liposome dynamics as well as membrane-peptide interactions feasible at accessible computational expense.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e37:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mingwei Wan, Lianghui Gao, Weihai Fang&lt;/p&gt;

Urban extent data play an important role in urban management and urban studies, such as monitoring the process of urbanization and changes in the spatial configuration of urban areas. Traditional methods of extracting urban-extent information are primarily based on manual investigations and classifications using remote sensing images, and these methods have such problems as large costs in labor and time and low precision. This study proposes an improved, simplified and flexible method for extracting urban extents over multiple scales and the construction of spatiotemporal models using DMSP/OLS nighttime light (NTL) for practical situations. This method eliminates the regional temporal and spatial inconsistency of thresholding NTL in large-scale and multi-temporal scenes. Using this method, we have extracted the urban extents and calculated the corresponding areas on the county, municipal and provincial scales in China from 2000 to 2012. In addition, validation with the data of reference data shows that the overall accuracy (OA), Kappa and F1 Scores were 0.996, 0.793, and 0.782, respectively. We increased the spatial resolution of the urban extent to 500 m (approximately four times finer than the results of previous studies). Based on the urban extent dataset proposed above, we analyzed changes in urban extents over time and observed that urban sprawl has grown in all of the counties of China. We also identified three patterns of urban sprawl: Early Urban Growth, Constant Urban Growth and Recent Urban Growth. In addition, these trends of urban sprawl are consistent with the western, eastern and central cities of China, respectively, in terms of their spatial distribution, socioeconomic characteristics and historical background. Additionally, the urban extents display the spatial configurations of urban areas intuitively. The proposed urban extent dataset is available for download and can provide reference data and support for future studies of urbanization and urban planning.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4f0:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yao Yao, Dongsheng Chen, Le Chen, Huan Wang, Qingfeng Guan&lt;/p&gt;

Peptidergic sensory neurons play a critical role in nociceptive pathways. To precisely define the function and plasticity of sensory neurons in detail, new tools such as transgenic mouse models are needed. We employed electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry to characterize in detail dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons expressing an inducible CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt; (CGRP-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); and compared them to DRG neurons expressing Nav1.8&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; (Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; (TRPV1-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and TRPV1-GFP (V1-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Tamoxifen effectively induced CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt; production in DRG. ≈87% of CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt;-expressing neurons were co-labeled CGRP antibody. Three small and two medium-large-sized (5HT3a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NPY2R&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and NPY2R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neuronal groups with unique electrophysiological profiles were CGRP-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were detected in all CGRP-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups, as well as in 5 additional neuronal groups: MrgprD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, MrgprD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CGRP&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, vGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ≈30% of trkC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Differences between TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; and Nav1.8&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; reporters were that unlike TRPV1-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; expression was detected in non-nociceptive vGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and trkC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; populations. Many TRPV1-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons did not respond to capsaicin. In contrast, V1-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were in 4 groups, each of which was capsaicin-sensitive. Finally, none of the analyzed reporter lines showed &lt;i&gt;cre&lt;/i&gt;-recombination in trkB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, calbindin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, 70% of trkC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or parvalbumin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, which together encompassed ≈20% of Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons. The data presented here increases our knowledge of peptidergic sensory neuron characteristics, while showing the efficiency and specificity manipulation of peptidergic neurons by the CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt; reporter. We also demonstrate that manipulation of all C- and A-nociceptors is better achieved with TRPV1-cre reporter. Finally, the described approach for detailed characterization of sensory neuronal groups can be applied to a variety of reporter mice.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b794:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mayur J.

Finally, the described approach for detailed characterization of sensory neuronal groups can be applied to a variety of reporter mice.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26170-5</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26170-5</originId><author><name>David Talavera</name></author><crawled>1526893870372</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/e7-eRL-hDlY/s41598-018-26170-5</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26170-5</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>22cff463</fingerprint><published>1526886000000</published><title>Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archetypal transcriptional blocks underpin yeast gene regulation in response to changes in growth conditions, Published online: 21 May 2018;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the association between preoperational factors and patients’ short-term outcome after proximal fibular osteotomy (PFO) and to provide a basis for detailed surgical indication and patient selection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing PFO between January 2015 and December 2015. Preoperational clinical data including gender, age, duration of disease, visual analogue score (VAS) and American Knee Society (KSS) score were collected. The radiological factors including hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA angle), condyle-plateau angle (CP angle), Kellgren and Lawrence grade (KL grade), joint space width of both compartments and settlement value were also considered. Patients were followed for at 12 months postoperatively. Both clinical and functional KSS scores were obtained. The outcome of interest was divided into clinical outcome and functional outcome. For each, two criteria were defined: satisfaction and significant improvement. Satisfaction is characterized by a KSS clinical or functional score over 70 points (excellent and good results); significant improvement refers to an increase in KSS scores of more than 15 points. Bivariate logistic regression for the association between preoperational factors and outcomes of interest was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to detect the independent factors affecting the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 84 patients and 111 knees were followed-up. Of these, 17 knees were from males and 94 were from females. The average age was 59.45±8.82 years. The average preoperational VAS score, KSS clinical and functional score were 7.08±1.41 points, 49.14±10.95 points and 44.97±17.71 points, respectively. According to KL grading, there were 17 knees of grade 2, 47 knees of grade 3, and 47 knees of grade 4. In clinical outcomes, there were 51 knees in the satisfaction group and 77 knees in the significant improvement group. In functional outcomes, 43 knees were in the satisfaction group and 76 knees in the significant improvement group. KSS clinical score (OR = 1.134, 95%CI = 1.067–1.205, P = 0.000) was the independent factor associated with clinical satisfaction. Age (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.000–1.150, P = 0.048), VAS score (OR = 1.679, 95%CI = 1.041–2.706, P = 0.033), KSS clinical (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.005–1.144, P = 0.034) and functional (OR = 1.100, 95%CI = 1.044–1.159, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.345, 95%CI = 1.119–1.617, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 7.540, 95%CI = 1.307–43.484, P = 0.024) were the independent factors associated with functional satisfaction. KSS clinical (OR = 0.905, 95%CI = 0.850–0.963, P = 0.002) score, CP angle (OR = 0.760, 95%CI = 0.593–0.973, P = 0.030) and medial joint space width (OR = 0.001, 95%CI = 0.000–0.107, P = 0.003) were the independent factors associated with significant clinical improvement; VAS score (OR = 1.582, 95%CI = 1.042–2.402, P = 0.031), KSS functional (OR = 0.888, 95%CI = 0.838–0.942, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.292, 95%CI = 1.101–1.518, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 9.990, 95%CI = 1.485–67.197, P = 0.018) were the independent factors associated with significant functional improvement.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The independent factors affecting postoperative clinical outcome after PFO were KSS clinical score, CP angle and medial joint space width. In addition, the independent factors that influenced functional outcome included age, VAS score, KSS score, HKA angle and settlement value. As objective radiological evidence, HKA angle and settlement value could be used as an important basis for patient selection for PFO.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2f:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Liu, Wei Chen, Qi Zhang, Xiaoli Yan, Fei Zhang, Tianhua Dong, Guang Yang, Yingze Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

A key characteristic of a clinical trial is its statistical power. Here we investigate whether the statistical power of a trial is related to the gender of first and last authors on the paper reporting the results of the trial. Based on an analysis of 31,873 clinical trials published between 1974 and 2017, we find that adequate statistical power was most often present in clinical trials with a male first author and a female last author (20.6%, 95% confidence interval 19.4-21.8%), and that this figure was significantly higher than the percentage for other gender combinations (12.5-13.5%; P&amp;lt;0.0001). The absolute number of female authors in clinical trials gradually increased over time, with the percentage of female last authors rising from 20.7% (1975-85) to 28.5% (after 2005). Our results demonstrate the importance of gender diversity in research collaborations and emphasize the need to increase the number of women in senior positions in medicine.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34412</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Human Biology and Medicine</item></keywords><fingerprint>8ed85df1</fingerprint><published>1528156800000</published><title>Adequate statistical power in clinical trials is associated with the combination of a male first author and a female last author</title><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34412</canonicalUrl><engagement>167</engagement><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Clinical trials have a vital role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of new treatments and interventions in medicine.

However, multi-mycotoxin exposure assessment in breast milk has received very limited attention so far, resulting in a poor understanding of exposure during the early months of life. Here, we present the development and first application of a highly sensitive, specific and quantitative assay assessing up to 28 mycotoxins including regulated (aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone) and emerging mycotoxins as well as key metabolites by LC-MS/MS. After careful optimization of the sample preparation procedure, a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) protocol combined with a freeze-out step was utilized for method validation after spiking blank breast milk matrix. The limits of quantification varied between 0.009 and 2.9 ng/mL, for most analytes extraction recovery (74-116%) and intermediate precision (2-25%) were satisfactory. To assess multi-mycotoxin exposure for the first time in breast milk, the method was applied to examine contamination in 75 samples from Ogun State, Nigeria. Most of the samples were either entirely free of mycotoxins or contaminated to a minimal extent. Interestingly, the most abundant mycotoxin was beauvericin, which was not reported in this biological fluid before, with concentrations up to 0.019 ng/mL. In conclusion, the method demonstrated to be fit for purpose to determine and quantify low background contaminations in human breast milk. Based on the high sensitivity of the novel analytical method, it was possible to deduce that tolerable daily intake values were not exceeded by breastfeeding in the examined infants.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Unraveling_Early-Life_Mycotoxin_Exposures_via_LC-MS_MS_Breast_Milk_Analysis/6391121</href></item></alternate><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>c517fcad</fingerprint><published>1527638400000</published><title>Unraveling Early-Life Mycotoxin Exposures via LC-MS/MS Breast Milk Analysis</title><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Infants are particularly susceptible towards the toxic effects of food contaminants including mycotoxins.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The CES-D is a widely used depression screening instrument. While numerous studies have analysed its psychometric properties using exploratory and various kinds of confirmatory factor analyses, only few studies used Rasch models and none a multidimensional one.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The present study applies a multidimensional Rasch model using a sample of 518 respondents representative for the Austrian general population aged 18 to 65. A one-dimensional model, a four-dimensional model reflecting the subscale structure suggested by [1], and a four-dimensional model with the background variables gender and age were applied.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;While the one-dimensional model showed relatively good fit, the four-dimensional model fitted much better. EAP reliability indices were generally satisfying and the latent correlations varied between 0.31 and 0.88. In the analysis involving background variables, we found a limited effect of the participants’ gender. DIF effects were found unveiling some peculiarities. The two-items subscale Interpersonal Difficulties showed severe weaknesses and the Positive Affect subscale with the reversed item wordings also showed unexpected results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While a one-dimensional over-all score might still contain helpful information, the differentiation according to the latent dimension is strongly preferable.

Hand hygiene practice in hospitals is unfortunately still widely insufficient, even though it is known that transmitting pathogens via hands is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour. Electronic monitoring and feedback devices were installed in hospital patient rooms on top of hand-rub dispensers, next to the doorway, for a period of 17 weeks. In the emoticon condition, screens at the devices activated whenever a person entered or exited the room. Before using the alcohol-based hand-rub dispenser, a frowny face was displayed, indicating that hand hygiene should be performed. If the dispenser was subsequently used, this picture changed to a smiley face to positively reinforce the correct behaviour. Hand hygiene behaviour in the emoticon rooms significantly outperformed the behaviour in three other tested conditions. The strong effect in this field experiment indicates that activating injunctive norms may be a promising approach to improve hand hygiene behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761228:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Gaube, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, Daniel Dollinger, Eva Lermer&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Quality of obstetric care may not be constant within clinics and hospitals. Night shifts and weekends experience understaffing and other organizational hurdles in comparison with the weekday morning shifts, and this may influence the risk of maternal deaths.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To analyze the hourly variation of maternal mortality within Mexican health institutions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a cross-sectional multivariate analysis of 3,908 maternal deaths and 10,589,444 births that occurred within health facilities in Mexico during the 2010–2014 period, using data from the Health Information Systems of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We fitted negative binomial regression models with covariate adjustment to all data, as well as similar models by basic cause of death and by weekdays/weekends. The outcome was the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), defined as the number of deaths occurred per 100,000 live births. Hour of day was the main predictor; covariates were day of the week, c-section, marginalization, age, education, and number of pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Risk rises during early morning, reaching 52.5 deaths per 100,000 live births at 6:00 (95% UI: 46.3, 62.2). This is almost twice the lowest risk, which occurred at noon (27.1 deaths per 100,000 live births [95% U.I.: 23.0, 32.0]). Risk shows peaks coinciding with shift changes, at 07:00, and 14:00 and was significantly higher on weekends and holidays.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests strong hourly fluctuations in the risk of maternal death with during early morning hours and around the afternoon shift change.

Study objectives &lt;p&gt;In order to increase the value of randomized response techniques (RRTs) as tools for studying sensitive issues, the present study investigated whether the prevalence estimate for a sensitive item π^s assessed with the unrelated questionnaire method (UQM) is influenced by changing the probability of receiving the sensitive question &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;A short paper-and-pencil questionnaire was distributed to 1.243 university students assessing the 12-month prevalence of physical and cognitive doping using two versions of the UQM with different probabilities for receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3). Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess whether the prevalence estimates for physical and cognitive doping differed significantly between &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. The order of questions (physical doping and cognitive doping) as well as the probability of receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3) were counterbalanced across participants. Statistical power analyses were performed to determine sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence estimate for physical doping with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 was 22.5% (95% CI: 10.8–34.1), and 12.8% (95% CI: 7.6–18.0) with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. For cognitive doping with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3, the estimated prevalence was 22.5% (95% CI: 11.0–34.1), whereas it was 18.0% (95% CI: 12.5–23.5) with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. Likelihood-ratio tests revealed that prevalence estimates for both physical and cognitive doping, respectively, did not differ significantly under &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3 (physical doping: &lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.25, &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt; = 1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.13; cognitive doping: &lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.49, &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt; = 1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.48).

Study objectives &lt;p&gt;In order to increase the value of randomized response techniques (RRTs) as tools for studying sensitive issues, the present study investigated whether the prevalence estimate for a sensitive item π^s assessed with the unrelated questionnaire method (UQM) is influenced by changing the probability of receiving the sensitive question &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;A short paper-and-pencil questionnaire was distributed to 1.243 university students assessing the 12-month prevalence of physical and cognitive doping using two versions of the UQM with different probabilities for receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3). Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess whether the prevalence estimates for physical and cognitive doping differed significantly between &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. The order of questions (physical doping and cognitive doping) as well as the probability of receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3) were counterbalanced across participants. Statistical power analyses were performed to determine sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence estimate for physical doping with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 was 22.5% (95% CI: 10.8–34.1), and 12.8% (95% CI: 7.6–18.0) with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. For cognitive doping with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3, the estimated prevalence was 22.5% (95% CI: 11.0–34.1), whereas it was 18.0% (95% CI: 12.5–23.5) with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. Likelihood-ratio tests revealed that prevalence estimates for both physical and cognitive doping, respectively, did not differ significantly under &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3 (physical doping: &lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.25, &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt; = 1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.13; cognitive doping: &lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.49, &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt; = 1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.48).

&lt;p&gt;A general situation in the field is when you have a big pile of RNA or DNA pieces, and you want to analyze them – sort them out, determine how many different ones are in there and which ones are present more than the others. This is the underlying problem that “RNA-seq” assays are trying to answer: when you perturb some cells by changing something about their environment, what genes’ transcriptions get affected? What protein levels go up or down? One reasonable proxy for those is the levels of various mRNAs, but there’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of RNA in a cell, and sorting through it looking for changes has been nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some steps that a lot of these assays use to clean up the sample and get it into a form that can be more easily analyzed. The clean-up often involves some method to get all the ribosomal RNA out of there or to direct your readout away from it somehow, because that’s the majority of the RNA in cell lysate, and you don’t want your assay technology chasing it. Then there’s usually a fragmentation step, to break up the mRNAs into useful-sized pieces (which will be reassembled later on, computationally). Another common step is the use of reverse transcriptase enzymes to make complementary DNA out of all those mRNA pieces, because our techniques to amplify and sequence DNA are so flippin’ powerful. There’s often a step that tries to stick some sort of unique tag/label/identifier onto each DNA piece as well, using ligase enzymes, to aid in keeping track of all this stuff. These enzymes are the key to the whole business, along with modern sequencer technology and its associated computing prowess to reassemble everything from the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickSeq&quot;&gt;“Click-seq” variant&lt;/a&gt; works, though. You take your pile of mRNAs and expose them to reverse transcriptase, as before. But this time, you feed in a set amount of azide-containing nucleotides along with the usual mix of normal 2-deoxynucleotides to make your complementary DNAs. The thing is, these are chain-terminating residues for the RT enzyme, so what you end up with is a random heap of cDNA pieces, all of which end (on the 3′) with an azidonucleotide. And these turn into handles for introducing those labels/barcodes/identifiers. This way you avoid having to do a separate fragmentation step, because the reverse transcriptase has already fragmented things for you as it randomly choked on the azidonucleotides. And you avoid having to use the ligase enzymes to label everything, which can be expensive – you put those on via azide/alkyne reactions instead. The clicked oligos are still viable for PCR and sequencing, as it turns out, so that part of the process works fine, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7514-3_6&quot;&gt;the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; avoids some recombination artifacts that the other variants can be vulnerable to (ligases ligating the wrong things, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, it’s also good for picking up real recombination events that might be biologically relevant, but rare on the absolute scale. This happens with some viruses, and the technique &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006365&quot;&gt;has been used&lt;/a&gt; to look at so-called “defective interfering” RNAs which emerge over time in viral infections. These are somewhat mysterious – in some cases, they seem to hijack and (as the name says) perhaps interfere with the usual infectious cycle, but they may also prolong it and make it worse. It looks like some viruses have evolved to let these things accumulate, and there must be a reason for that, too. The only way to unravel all that is with a good enough RNA analysis technique, and the clicked nucleotides just may be providing one.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00223</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00223</originId><author><name>Tianyang Ji, Chunchun Zhang, Li Zheng, Debra Dunaway-Mariano, Karen N.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to reveal the factors associated with virologic failure in sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV)-treated patients, and identify baseline NS5A or NS5B resistance-associated substitutions (RASs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Four hundred ninety-three patients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection were treated with SOF/LDV; 31 had a history of interferon (IFN)-free treatment with daclatasvir and asunaprevir. The effect of baseline RASs on the response to SOF/LDV therapy was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) was achieved in 476 patients (96.6%). The SVR12 rates in the patients with IFN-free treatment-naïve and retreatment were 97.6% and 80.6%, respectively. HCV elimination was not achieved in 17 patients, 11 (including 5 with IFN-free retreatment) of whom had virologic failure. Eight patients had coexisting NS5A RASs of Q24, L28 and/or R30, L31, or Y93 and one patient had coexisting NS5A RASs of P32L and A92K. Interestingly, 10 and 8 patients had NS5B A218S and C316N RAS respectively. According to a multivariate analysis, coexisting NS5A RASs, NS5A P32 RAS, NS5B A218 and/or C316 RASs, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase were associated with virologic failure. In the naïve patients, all patients without NS5B A218 and/or C316 RAS achieved an SVR12. Notably, the SVR12 rates of patients with coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were significantly lower (83.3%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although SOF/LDV therapy resulted in a high SVR12 rate, coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were associated with virologic failure. These results might indicate that the coexisting baseline RASs influence the therapeutic effects of SOF/LDV.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84562:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seiichi Mawatari, Kohei Oda, Kazuaki Tabu, Sho Ijuin, Kotaro Kumagai, Kunio Fujisaki, Masafumi Hashiguchi, Yukiko Inada, Hirofumi Uto, Yasunari Hiramine, Takeshi Kure, Takeshi Hori, Oki Taniyama, Ai Kasai, Tsutomu Tamai, Akihiro Moriuchi, Akio Ido&lt;/p&gt;

However, the genetic basis of sensitivity to anthracyclines remains unclear. We created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24h exposure to varying doxorubicin dosages. The transcriptomic response is substantial: the majority of genes are differentially expressed and over 6000 genes show evidence of differential splicing, the later driven by reduced splicing fidelity in the presence of doxorubicin. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell damage, which in turn is associated with in vivo ACT risk.

We created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24h exposure to varying doxorubicin dosages. The transcriptomic response is substantial: the majority of genes are differentially expressed and over 6000 genes show evidence of differential splicing, the later driven by reduced splicing fidelity in the presence of doxorubicin. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell damage, which in turn is associated with in vivo ACT risk. We detect 447 response-expression QTLs and 42 response-splicing QTLs, which are enriched in lower ACT GWAS &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values, supporting the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; relevance of our map of genetic regulation of cellular response to anthracyclines.</content></summary><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1633f898592:1fd1cb:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25795-w</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25795-w</originId><author><name>Yonghoon Hong</name></author><crawled>1525944150659</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Z6desYF4yzo/s41598-018-25795-w</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25795-w</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>189c742a</fingerprint><published>1525935600000</published><title>Au nanoparticle@hollow mesoporous carbon with FeCo/graphitic shell nanoparticls as a magnetically recyclable yolk–shell nanocatalyst for catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Au nanoparticle@hollow mesoporous carbon with FeCo/graphitic shell nanoparticls as a magnetically recyclable yolk–shell nanocatalyst for catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Au nanoparticle@hollow mesoporous carbon with FeCo/graphitic shell nanoparticls as a magnetically recyclable yolk–shell nanocatalyst for catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25795-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25795-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Au nanoparticle@hollow mesoporous carbon with FeCo/graphitic shell nanoparticls as a magnetically recyclable yolk–shell nanocatalyst for catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Z6desYF4yzo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163495bea83:125a9f8:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Au nanoparticle@hollow mesoporous carbon with FeCo/graphitic shell nanoparticls as a magnetically recyclable yolk–shell nanocatalyst for catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Au nanoparticle@hollow mesoporous carbon with FeCo/graphitic shell nanoparticls as a magnetically recyclable yolk–shell nanocatalyst for catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25795-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25795-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Au nanoparticle@hollow mesoporous carbon with FeCo/graphitic shell nanoparticls as a magnetically recyclable yolk–shell nanocatalyst for catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Z6desYF4yzo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027487?af=R</link><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027487?af=R</originId><author><name>S.

The ECDC modeling tool showed that the proportion of undiagnosed HIV infections declined from 50% in 1990 to 15% in 2015.

The incidence rate declined in 2000 and the decline of the number of newly acquired HIV infections, after a decline after 2003 is offset by population growth. The proportion of undiagnosed infections has declined to 15% but the number of undiagnosed infections remains stable.

Modules in the network are connected in a layered web that gives insight into the hierarchical organization of the cell.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26316-5</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26316-5</originId><author><name>Li-Jun Zuo</name></author><crawled>1527671824101</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/8wppCi9QTMA/s41598-018-26316-5</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26316-5</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>78fd7428</fingerprint><published>1527663600000</published><title>The Relationship between Cerebral White Matter Integrity and Cognitive Function in Mild Stroke with Basal Ganglia Region Infarcts</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Relationship between Cerebral White Matter Integrity and Cognitive Function in Mild Stroke with Basal Ganglia Region Infarcts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Relationship between Cerebral White Matter Integrity and Cognitive Function in Mild Stroke with Basal Ganglia Region Infarcts, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26316-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26316-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The Relationship between Cerebral White Matter Integrity and Cognitive Function in Mild Stroke with Basal Ganglia Region Infarcts&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/8wppCi9QTMA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163b0561ee5:256d7e7:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Relationship between Cerebral White Matter Integrity and Cognitive Function in Mild Stroke with Basal Ganglia Region Infarcts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Relationship between Cerebral White Matter Integrity and Cognitive Function in Mild Stroke with Basal Ganglia Region Infarcts, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26316-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26316-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The Relationship between Cerebral White Matter Integrity and Cognitive Function in Mild Stroke with Basal Ganglia Region Infarcts&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/8wppCi9QTMA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329714v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329714v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Lieven, C.</name></author><crawled>1527182547109</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329714v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>c6515471</fingerprint><published>1527145200000</published><title>A genome-scale metabolic model for Methylococcus capsulatus predicts reduced efficiency uphill electron transfer to pMMO.

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a zinc-dependent protease associated with early immune responses to &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection, macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation. We evaluated whether adjunctive inhibition of MMP-9 could improve the response to standard TB treatment in a mouse model that develops necrotic lesions. Six weeks after an aerosol infection with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, C3HeB/FeJ mice received standard TB treatment (12 weeks) comprising rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide alone or in combination with either anti-MMP-9 antibody, etanercept (positive control) or isotype antibody (negative control) for 6 weeks. Anti-MMP-9 and the isotype control had comparable high serum exposures and expected terminal half-life. The relapse rate in mice receiving standard TB treatment was 46.6%. Compared to the standard TB treatment, relapse rates in animals that received adjunctive treatments with anti-MMP-9 antibody or etanercept were significantly decreased to 25.9% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) and 29.8% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019) respectively, but were not different from the arm that received the isotype control antibody (25.9%).

Colditz, Adetunji T. Toriola, Guillermo Felipe López Sánchez, Davy Vancampfort, Mark Hamer, Brendon Stubbs, Thomas Waldhör&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the associations of handgrip strength and cognitive function in cancer survivors ≥ 60 years old using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data in two waves of NHANES (2011–2014) were aggregated. Handgrip strength in kilogram (kg) was defined as the maximum value achieved using either hand. Two cognitive function tests were conducted among adults 60 years and older. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) examines categorical verbal fluency (a component of executive function), and the Digital Symbol Substitution test (DSST) assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory. Survey analysis procedures were used to account for the complex sampling design of the NHANES. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations of handgrip strength with cognitive test scores, adjusting for confounders (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, depressive symptoms and leisure time physical activity).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 383 cancer survivors (58.5% women, mean age = 70.9 years, mean BMI = 29.3 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), prevalent cancer types were breast (22.9%), prostate (16.4%), colon (6.9%) and cervix (6.2%).

Background &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the associations of handgrip strength and cognitive function in cancer survivors ≥ 60 years old using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data in two waves of NHANES (2011–2014) were aggregated. Handgrip strength in kilogram (kg) was defined as the maximum value achieved using either hand. Two cognitive function tests were conducted among adults 60 years and older. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) examines categorical verbal fluency (a component of executive function), and the Digital Symbol Substitution test (DSST) assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory. Survey analysis procedures were used to account for the complex sampling design of the NHANES. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations of handgrip strength with cognitive test scores, adjusting for confounders (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, depressive symptoms and leisure time physical activity).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 383 cancer survivors (58.5% women, mean age = 70.9 years, mean BMI = 29.3 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), prevalent cancer types were breast (22.9%), prostate (16.4%), colon (6.9%) and cervix (6.2%). In women, each increase in kg of handgrip strength was associated with 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.33) higher score on AFT and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.30 to 1.35) higher score on DSST. In men, we observed an inverted U-shape association where cognitive function peaked at handgrip strength of 40–42 kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Handgrip strength, a modifiable factor, appears to be associated with aspects of cognitive functions in cancer survivors.

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636f49ddb2:4e2d26:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.

Haploinsufficiency, a dominant phenotype caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation, has been rarely observed. However, high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping of yeast morphological characteristics revealed haploinsufficiency phenotypes for more than half of 1,112 essential genes under optimal growth conditions. Additionally, 40% of the essential genes with no obvious phenotype under optimal growth conditions displayed haploinsufficiency under severe growth conditions. Haploinsufficiency was detected more frequently in essential genes than in nonessential genes. Similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were observed mostly in mutants with heterozygous deletion of functionally related genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency phenotypes were caused by functional defects of the genes. A global view of the gene network was presented based on the similarities of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Our dataset contains rich information regarding essential gene functions, providing evidence that single-cell phenotyping is a powerful approach, even in the heterozygous condition, for analyzing complex biological systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/T_6m60ob9nc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636a0d7f35:4c6cd:d63e3ae2</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shinsuke Ohnuki, Yoshikazu Ohya&lt;/p&gt;

An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. Methods: We designed mathematical models and fit them to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We used the model to predict the level of immune protection and morbidity for different inoculum doses and to explore what an optimal inoculum dose might be. Results: We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. We find that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity depends on the pathogen and both protection and morbidity do not always increase with increasing inoculum dose. An intermediate inoculum dose can provide the best balance between immune protection and morbidity, though this depends on the specific weighting of protection and morbidity.

Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. Methods: We designed mathematical models and fit them to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We used the model to predict the level of immune protection and morbidity for different inoculum doses and to explore what an optimal inoculum dose might be. Results: We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. We find that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity depends on the pathogen and both protection and morbidity do not always increase with increasing inoculum dose. An intermediate inoculum dose can provide the best balance between immune protection and morbidity, though this depends on the specific weighting of protection and morbidity. Conclusions: Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework which combines data and models can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.</content></content></item><item><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Expanding_the_Chemical_Space_of_Biocompatible_Fluorophores_Nanohoops_in_Cells/6261884</link><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Expanding_the_Chemical_Space_of_Biocompatible_Fluorophores_Nanohoops_in_Cells/6261884</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1526309352177</crawled><description>The synthesis of the first aqueous-soluble version of the carbon nanohoop scaffold is reported and its imaging capabilities in live cells are demonstrated.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16340d7cea2:14b5655:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew E.

The faculty of language is thought to be uniquely human. Recently, it has been claimed that songbirds are able to associate meaning with sound, comparable to the way that humans do. In human language, the meaning of expressions (semantics) is dependent on a mind-internal hierarchical structure (syntax). Meaning is associated with structure through the principle of compositionality, whereby the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meaning of its constituent parts and the mode of composition. We argue that while recent experimental findings on songbird call sequences offer exciting novel insights into animal communication, despite claims to the contrary, they are quite unlike what we find in human language. There are indeed remarkable behavioral and neural parallels in auditory-vocal imitation learning between songbirds and human infants that are absent in our closest evolutionary relatives, the great apes. But so far, there is no convincing evidence of syntax-determined meaning in nonhuman animals.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iFTIxhJ_hsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163cbf2cb5e:ded3d8:a96d255</id><engagementRate>0.08</engagementRate><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Johan J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Child marriage harms girls’ health and hinders progress toward development goals. Randomized studies have shown that providing financial incentives for girls’ education can effectively delay marriage, but larger-scale interventions are needed in light of slow progress toward curbing the practice. Many sub-Saharan African countries eliminated primary school tuition fees over the past two decades, resulting in massive increases in enrolment. We measured the effect of these policies on the probability of primary school completion and of marriage before 15 and 18 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used Demographic and Health Surveys to assemble a dataset of women born between 1970 and 2000 in 16 countries. These data were merged with longitudinal information on the timing of tuition fee elimination in each country. We estimated the impact of fee removal using fixed effects regression to compare changes in the prevalence of child marriage over time between women who were exposed to tuition-free primary schooling and those who were not.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The removal of tuition fees led to modest average declines in the prevalence of child marriage across all of the treated countries. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between countries. The prevalence of child marriage declined by 10–15 percentage points in Ethiopia and Rwanda following tuition elimination but we found no evidence that the removal of tuition fees had an impact on child marriage rates in Cameroon or Malawi. Reductions in child marriage were not consistently accompanied by increases in the probability of primary school completion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Eliminating tuition fees led to reductions in child marriage on a national scale in most countries despite challenges with implementation. Improving the quality of the education available may strengthen these effects and bolster progress toward numerous other public health goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e25:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alissa Koski, Erin C.

A universal turnaround has been detected in many countries of the World from shrinking to expanding forests. The forest area of western Europe expanded already in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Such early trends of forest resources cannot be associated with the rapid rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide nor with the anthropogenic climate change, which have taken place since the mid 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Modern, most recent spatial patterns of forest expansions and contractions do not correlate with the geography of climate trends nor with dry versus moist areas. Instead, the forest resources trends of nations correlate positively with UNDP Human Development Index. This indicates that forest resources of nations have improved along with progress in human well-being. Highly developed countries apply modern agricultural methods on good farmlands and abandon marginal lands, which become available for forest expansion. Developed countries invest in sustainable programs of forest management and nature protection. Our findings are significant for predicting the future of the terrestrial carbon sink. They suggest that the large sink of carbon recently observed in forests of the World will persist, if the well-being of people continues to improve. However, despite the positive trends in domestic forests, developed nations increasingly outsource their biomass needs abroad through international trade, and all nations rely on unsustainable energy use and wasteful patterns of material consumption.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fcc:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pekka E.

Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal deaths. The aetiology of preeclampsia is largely unknown but a polygenetic component is assumed. To explore this hypothesis, we performed an in-depth whole-exome sequencing study in women with (cases, N = 50) and without (controls, N = 50) preeclampsia. The women were identified in an unselected cohort of 2,545 pregnant women based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Medical Birth Registry. Matching DNA was obtained from a biobank containing excess blood from routine antenatal care visits. Novogene performed the whole-exome sequencing blinded to preeclampsia status. Variants for comparison between cases and controls were filtered in the Ingenuity Variant Analysis software. We applied two different strategies; a &lt;i&gt;disease association panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included variants in single genes associated with established clinical risk factors for preeclampsia, and a &lt;i&gt;gene panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included biological pathways harbouring genes previously reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Variant variability was compared in cases and controls at the level of biological processes, signalling pathways, and in single genes. Regardless of the applied strategy and the level of variability examined, we consistently found positive correlations between variant numbers in cases and controls (all R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s&gt;0.88). Contrary to what was expected, cases carried fewer variants in biological processes and signalling pathways than controls (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values ≤0.02). In conclusion, our findings challenge the hypothesis of a polygenetic aetiology for preeclampsia with a common network of susceptibility genes. The greater genetic diversity among controls may suggest a protective role of genetic diversity against the development of preeclampsia.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219b:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anette Tarp Hansen, Jens Magnus Bernth Jensen, Anne-Mette Hvas, Mette Christiansen&lt;/p&gt;

Stressor-exposure has been shown to exacerbate inflammation and change the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota; however stressor-induced effects on microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors are unknown. Thus, bacterial-produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as microbial community composition, were assessed in the colons of mice exposed to stress during infection with &lt;i&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/i&gt;. Mice were exposed to overnight restraint on 7 consecutive nights, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first exposure of restraint, mice were orally challenged with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt; or with vehicle. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SCFA levels measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Pathogen levels and colonic inflammation were also assessed 6 days post-infection. Results demonstrated that the microbial community structure and SCFA production were significantly affected by both stressor exposure and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt;-infection. Exposure to prolonged restraint in the absence of infection significantly reduced SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid). Multiple bacterial taxa were affected by stressor exposure, with the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; being significantly reduced and directly correlated with propionic acid. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; abundances were inversely correlated with colonic inflammation, supporting the contention that &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; helps to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses.

Typically, such proteomic profiles are interpreted intuitively or by simple correlation analysis. Here, we present a computational method to generate causal explanations for proteomic profiles using prior mechanistic knowledge in the literature, as recorded in cellular pathway maps. To demonstrate its potential, we use this method to analyze the cascading events after EGF stimulation of a cell line, to discover new pathways in platelet activation, to identify influential regulators of oncoproteins in breast cancer, to describe signaling characteristics in predefined subtypes of ovarian and breast cancers, and to highlight which pathway relations are most frequently activated across 32 cancer types.

Typically, such proteomic profiles are interpreted intuitively or by simple correlation analysis.

Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) that can modulate RNA splicing are used for the treatment of many genetic disorders. To enhance the efficacy of modulating splicing, it is important to optimize SSOs with regard to target sites, GC content, melting temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value), chemistries, and lengths. Thus, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay systems that allow for the rapid and simple screening of SSOs are essential for optimizing SSO design. In this study, we established a novel tri-chromatic reporter cell line for SSO screening. This reporter cell line is designed to express three different fluorescent proteins (blue, green, and red) and was employed for high content screening (HCS, also known as high content analysis; HCA) for the evaluation of SSO-induced exon skipping by analyzing the expression levels of fluorescent proteins. The blue fluorescent protein is stably expressed throughout the cell and is useful for data normalization using cell numbers. Furthermore, both the green and red fluorescent proteins were used for monitoring the splicing patterns of target genes. Indeed, we demonstrated that this novel reporter cell line involving HCS leads to a more rapid and simple approach for the evaluation of exon skipping than widely used methods, such as RT-PCR, western blotting, and quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, a brief screening of Locked nucleic acids (LNA)-based SSOs targeting exon 51 in &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt; was performed using the reporter cell line. The LNA-based SSO cocktail shows high exon 51 skipping in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the LNA-based SSO cocktails display high exon 51 skipping activities on endogenous &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b3:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takenori Shimo, Keisuke Tachibana, Satoshi Obika&lt;/p&gt;

Clinical data suggest that the neuroendocrine stress response is chronically dysregulated in a subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), potentially contributing to both disease progression and the development of psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. Whether neuroendocrine dysregulation and psychiatric comorbidities reflect direct effects of epilepsy-related pathologies, or secondary effects of disease burden particular to humans with epilepsy (i.e. social estrangement, employment changes) is not clear. Animal models provide an opportunity to dissociate these factors. Therefore, we queried whether epileptic mice would reproduce neuroendocrine and behavioral changes associated with human epilepsy. Male FVB mice were exposed to pilocarpine to induce status epilepticus (SE) and the subsequent development of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Morning baseline corticosterone levels were elevated in pilocarpine treated mice at 1, 7 and 10 weeks post-SE relative to controls. Similarly, epileptic mice had increased adrenal weight when compared to control mice. Exposure to acute restraint stress resulted in hypersecretion of corticosterone 30 min after the onset of the challenge. Anatomical analyses revealed reduced Fos expression in infralimbic and prelimbic prefrontal cortex, ventral subiculum and basal amygdala following restraint. No differences in Fos immunoreactivity were found in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, hippocampal subfields or central amygdala. In order to assess emotional behavior, a second cohort of mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests, including sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, 24h home-cage monitoring and forced swim. Epileptic mice showed increased anhedonic behavior, hyperactivity and anxiety-like behaviors. Together these data demonstrate that epileptic mice develop HPA axis hyperactivity and exhibit behavioral dysfunction. Endocrine and behavioral changes are associated with impaired recruitment of forebrain circuits regulating stress inhibition and emotional reactivity. Loss of forebrain control may underlie pronounced endocrine dysfunction and comorbid psychopathologies seen in temporal lobe epilepsy.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2b:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aynara C.

However, a small subset of early-stage cases develop progressive and fatal disease.

We evaluated the use of next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing of the T cell receptor β gene (&lt;i&gt;TCRB&lt;/i&gt;) in lesional skin biopsies to predict progression and survival in a discovery cohort of 208 patients with CTCL (177 with MF) from a 15-year longitudinal observational clinical study. We compared these data to the results in an independent validation cohort of 101 CTCL patients (87 with MF). The tumor clone frequency (TCF) in lesional skin, measured by high-throughput sequencing of the &lt;i&gt;TCRB&lt;/i&gt; gene, was an independent prognostic factor of both progression-free and overall survival in patients with CTCL and MF in particular. In early-stage patients, a TCF of &gt;25% in the skin was a stronger predictor of progression than any other established prognostic factor (stage IB versus IA, presence of plaques, high blood lactate dehydrogenase concentration, large-cell transformation, or age). The TCF therefore may accurately predict disease progression in early-stage MF. Early identification of patients at high risk for progression could help identify candidates who may benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before their disease becomes treatment-refractory.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1634619c5fc:d47db8:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a malignancy of skin-tropic memory T cells.

In early-stage patients, a TCF of &gt;25% in the skin was a stronger predictor of progression than any other established prognostic factor (stage IB versus IA, presence of plaques, high blood lactate dehydrogenase concentration, large-cell transformation, or age). The TCF therefore may accurately predict disease progression in early-stage MF. Early identification of patients at high risk for progression could help identify candidates who may benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before their disease becomes treatment-refractory.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25769-y</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25769-y</originId><author><name>B.

Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in Ontario, Canada. We describe the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario and examine trends in the incidence of non-disseminated and disseminated LD. LD surveillance data from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) from 2005–2014 were mapped to symptoms according to syndrome groups (erythema migrans (EM), flu-like, cardiac, neurologic or arthritic) and disease stages (early localized, early disseminated or late disseminated). During the study period, 1,230 cases due to &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdoferi&lt;/i&gt; were reported in Ontario with annual incidence rates ranging from 0.32 (2006) to 2.16 (2013) cases per 100,000 population. Seventy percent of cases had EM and the proportion of cases with EM increased over time. Other clinical manifestations included flu-like (75%), arthritic (42%), neurologic (41%) and cardiac (6%) symptoms. Early localized disease (n = 415) manifested with EM (87%) and flu-like (57%) symptoms; early disseminated disease (n = 216) manifested with neurologic (94%), cardiac (10%) and EM (63%) symptoms; and late disseminated disease (n = 475) manifested with EM (62%), neurologic (55%), cardiac (9%), and arthritic symptoms (i.e., arthralgia (93%) and arthritis (7%)). Early localized and early disseminated cases (88% each) occurred primarily from May through September, compared to late disseminated cases (81%). The proportion of cases reported to public health within 30 days of illness onset increased during the study period, while the proportion of cases reported within 1–3 months and &gt;3 months decreased. Geographical variations characterized by higher incidence of early localized disease and earlier public health notification (within 30 days of illness onset) occurred in regions with established or recently established LD risk areas, while later public health notification (&gt;3 months after illness onset) was reported more frequently in regions with recently established or no identified risk areas. This is the first study to describe the clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario, Canada. The observed geographical variations in the epidemiology of LD in Ontario reinforce the need for regionally focused public health strategies aimed at increasing awareness, promoting earlier recognition and reporting, and encouraging greater uptake of preventive measures.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84558:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karen O.

A new labeling reagent for vitamin analysis, 2-amino-10-ethyl acridine ketone (AEAO), has been synthesized and successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples. The reaction of AEAO with vitamins could proceed easily and quickly in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) as condensing reagent within 45 min. The derivatives exhibited excellent fluorescence property with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 430 nm, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to the optimization of pre-column derivatization. Solid phase extraction with HLB cartridges was used for the extraction and purification of water-soluble vitamins in tea samples. The LODs for vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 were 2.56 and 2.22 ng mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples. The study provided a highly sensitive method for accurate analysis of trace vitamins from natural products.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f49:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Baolei Fan, Jinmao You, Yourui Suo, Chunqi Qian&lt;/p&gt;

Verbal autopsy methods have been developed to determine medical causes of deathforprioritizing disease control programs. Additional information on social causesmay facilitate designing of more appropriate prevention strategies. Use of social autopsy in investigations of causes of adult deaths has been limited. Therefore, acommunity-based study was conducted in NandpurKalour Block of Fatehgarh Sahib District in Punjab (India)for finding social causes of adult deaths. An integrated verbal and social autopsy toolwas developed and verbal autopsies of 600 adult deaths, occurring over a reference period of one year, were conducted in 2014. Quantitative analysis described the socio-demographic characteristics of the deceased, number and type of consultations from health care providers, and type of care received during illness. Qualitative data was analyzed to find out social causes of death by thematic analysis. The median duration of illness from symptom onset till death was 9 days (IQR = 1–45 days). At the onset of illness, 72 (12%) deceased utilized home remedies and 424 (70.7%)received care from a clinic/hospital, and 104 (17.3%) died withoutreceiving any care. The number of medical consultations varied from one to six (median = 2). The utilization of government health facilities and qualified allopathic doctor increased with each consultation (p value&amp;lt;0.05). The top five social causes of adult deaths in a rural area of Punjab in India. (1) Non availability of medical practitioner in the vicinity, (2) communication gaps between doctor and patient on regular intake of medication, (3) delayed referral by service provider, (4) poor communication with family on illness, and (5) perception of illness to be ‘mild’ by the family or care taker. To conclude, social autopsy tool should be integrated with verbal autopsy tool for identification of individual, community, and health system level factors associated with adult mortality.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b947:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mamta Gupta, Manmeet Kaur, P.

Ferns are an important component of ecosystems around the world. Studies of the impacts that global changes may have on ferns are scarce, yet emerging studies indicate that some species may be particularly sensitive to climate change. The lack of research in this subject is much more aggravated in the case of epiphytes, and especially those that live under temperate climates. A mathematical model was developed for two temperate epiphytic ferns in order to predict potential impacts on spore germination kinetics, in response to different scenarios of global change, coming from increasing temperature and forest fragmentation. Our results show that an increasing temperature will have a negative impact over the populations of these temperate epiphytic ferns. Under unfragmented forests the germination percentage was comparatively less influenced than in fragmented patches. This study highlight that, in the long term, populations of the studied epiphytic temperate ferns may decline due to climate change. Overall, epiphytic fern communities will suffer changes in diversity, richness and dominance. Our study draws attention to the role of ferns in epiphytic communities of temperate forests, emphasizing the importance of considering these plants in any conservation strategy, specifically forest conservation. From a methodological point of view, the model we propose could be easily used to dynamically monitor the status of ecosystems, allowing the quick prediction of possible future scenarios, which is a crucial issue in biodiversity conservation decision-making.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f76:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jose María Gabriel y Galán, Antonio Murciano, Laure Sirvent, Abel Sánchez, James E.

Animal paths are analogous to intractable mathematical problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the shortest path problem (SPP). Both the TSP and SPP require an individual to find the shortest path through multiple targets but the TSP demands a return to the start, while the SPP does not. Vervet monkeys are very efficient in solving TSPs but this species is a multiple central place forager that does not always return to the same sleeping site and thus theoretically should be selected to find solutions to SPPs rather than TSPs. We examined path choice by wild vervets in an SPP experimental array where the shortest paths usually differed from those consistent with common heuristic strategies, the nearest-neighbor rule (NNR–go to the closest resource that has not been visited), and the convex hull (put a mental loop around sites, adding inner targets in order of distance from the edge)–an efficient strategy for TSPs but not SPPs. In addition, humans solving SPPs use an initial segment strategy (ISS–choose the straightest path at the beginning, only turning when necessary) and we looked at vervet paths consistent with this strategy. In 615 trials by single foragers, paths usually conformed to the NNR and rarely the slightly more efficient convex hull, supporting that vervets may be selected to solve SPPs. Further, like humans solving SPPs, vervets showed a tendency to use the ISS. Paths consistent with heuristics dropped off sharply, and use of the shortest path increased, when heuristics led to longer paths showing trade-offs in efficiency versus cognitive load. Two individuals out of 17, found the shortest path most often, showing inter-individual variation in path planning. Given support for the NNR and the ISS, we propose a new rule-of-thumb termed the “region heuristic” that vervets may apply in multi-destination routes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1c:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Julie Annette Teichroeb, Eve Ann Smeltzer&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Due to the surrounding bone, the human inner ear is relatively inaccessible and difficult to reach for cellular and molecular analyses. However, these types of investigations are needed to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology and progression of several inner ear disorders. Moreover, the fluid from the inner ear cannot be sampled for micro-chemical analyses from healthy individuals &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, in the present paper, we studied patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) undergoing trans-labyrinthine surgery (TLS). Our primary aim was to identify perilymph proteins in patients with VS on an individual level. Our second aim was to investigate the proteins identified at a functional level and our final aim was to search for biological markers for tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients underwent TLS for sporadic VS. Perilymph was aspirated through the round window before opening the labyrinth. One sample was contaminated and excluded resulting in 15 usable samples. Perilymph samples were analyzed with an online tandem LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Data were analyzed with MaxQuant software to identify the total number of proteins and to quantify proteins in individual samples. Protein function was analyzed using the PANTHER Overrepresentation tool. Associations between perilymph protein content, clinical parameters, tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter were assessed using Random Forest and Boruta. In total, 314 proteins were identified; 60 in all 15 patients and 130 proteins only once in 15 patients. Ninety-one proteins were detected in at least 12 out of 15 patients. Random Forest followed by Boruta analysis confirmed that alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (P02765) was an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss. In addition, functional analysis showed that numerous processes were significantly increased in the perilymph. The top three enriched biological processes were: 1) secondary metabolic processes; 2) complement activation and 3) cell recognition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The proteome of perilymph in patients with vestibular schwannoma has an inter-individual stable section. However, even in a cohort with homogenous disease, the variation between individuals represented the majority of the detected proteins. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, P02765, was shown to be an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss, a finding that needs to be verified in other studies. In pathway analysis perilymph had highly enriched functions, particularly in terms of increased immune and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84555:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jesper Edvardsson Rasmussen, Göran Laurell, Helge Rask-Andersen, Jonas Bergquist, Per Olof Eriksson&lt;/p&gt;

Associations between perilymph protein content, clinical parameters, tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter were assessed using Random Forest and Boruta. In total, 314 proteins were identified; 60 in all 15 patients and 130 proteins only once in 15 patients. Ninety-one proteins were detected in at least 12 out of 15 patients. Random Forest followed by Boruta analysis confirmed that alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (P02765) was an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss. In addition, functional analysis showed that numerous processes were significantly increased in the perilymph. The top three enriched biological processes were: 1) secondary metabolic processes; 2) complement activation and 3) cell recognition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The proteome of perilymph in patients with vestibular schwannoma has an inter-individual stable section. However, even in a cohort with homogenous disease, the variation between individuals represented the majority of the detected proteins. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, P02765, was shown to be an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss, a finding that needs to be verified in other studies. In pathway analysis perilymph had highly enriched functions, particularly in terms of increased immune and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05158-1</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05158-1</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1526394139339</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05158-1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>402e1176</fingerprint><published>1526367600000</published><title>Aluminium producers promise a cleaner smelting pot</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>10</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aluminium producers promise a cleaner smelting pot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminium producers promise a cleaner smelting pot, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05158-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05158-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Industrial partnership and new anode technology could provide a greener way to make the metal — but cleaner electricity sources are also needed.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05158-1/d41586-018-05158-1_15761212.jpg</url></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163642e32cb:37f5b22:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aluminium producers promise a cleaner smelting pot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminium producers promise a cleaner smelting pot, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05158-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05158-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Industrial partnership and new anode technology could provide a greener way to make the metal — but cleaner electricity sources are also needed.</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323964v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323964v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Li, A.</name></author><crawled>1526500452469</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323964v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>da9bf896</fingerprint><published>1526454000000</published><title>The Carcinogenome Project: In-vitro Gene Expression Profiling of Chemical Perturbations to Predict Long-Term Carcinogenicity [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/16/323964</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Most chemicals in commerce have not been evaluated for their carcinogenic potential.

While previous studies have shown that human behavior adjusts in response to uncertainty, it is still not well understood how uncertainty is estimated and represented. As probability distributions are high dimensional objects, only constrained families of distributions with a low number of parameters can be specified from finite data. However, it is unknown what the structural assumptions are that the brain uses to estimate them. We introduce a novel paradigm that requires human participants of either sex to explicitly estimate the dispersion of a distribution over future observations. Judgments are based on a very small sample from a centered, normally distributed random variable that was suggested by the framing of the task. This probability density estimation task could optimally be solved by inferring the dispersion parameter of a normal distribution. We find that although behavior closely tracks uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis and resists an explanation with simple heuristics, it is hardly consistent with parametric inference of a normal distribution. Despite the transparency of the simple generating process, participants estimate a distribution biased towards the observed instances while still strongly generalizing beyond the sample. The inferred internal distributions can be well approximated by a nonparametric mixture of spatially extended basis distributions. Thus, our results suggest that fluctuations have an excessive effect on human uncertainty judgments because of representations that can adapt overly flexibly to the sample. This might be of greater utility in more general conditions in structurally uncertain environments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o3YR8jyibrQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163cbf78bf1:de5cd6:c2c34441</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Schustek, Rubén Moreno-Bote&lt;/p&gt;

While numerous papers have illuminated the worthiness of research collaboration, relatively few have addressed its prerequisites. In our study, seven prerequisites for research collaboration were extracted from the existing literature, and 460 student researchers were surveyed for their perceptions of the prerequisites’ importance. Focusing on voluntary research collaborations rather than brokered ones, it was found that socially oriented prerequisites such as reciprocal interactions, accountability, trust, and equality are perceived of more importance than prerequisites of psychical proximity, networking channels, and funds and material supplies (substance- and entity-related prerequisites). With latent regression analyses, we also found that Chinese and older, more experienced researchers are inclined to stress the importance of equality. Researchers of different cohorts prioritise substance- and entity-related prerequisites disparately. Specifically, Chinese researchers emphasise the necessity of funds, while researchers from first-tier universities place more value on networking channels. Disciplinary differences for the prerequisite of proximity were also discovered. Based on these results, discussion and implications were referred.

In our study, seven prerequisites for research collaboration were extracted from the existing literature, and 460 student researchers were surveyed for their perceptions of the prerequisites’ importance. Focusing on voluntary research collaborations rather than brokered ones, it was found that socially oriented prerequisites such as reciprocal interactions, accountability, trust, and equality are perceived of more importance than prerequisites of psychical proximity, networking channels, and funds and material supplies (substance- and entity-related prerequisites). With latent regression analyses, we also found that Chinese and older, more experienced researchers are inclined to stress the importance of equality. Researchers of different cohorts prioritise substance- and entity-related prerequisites disparately. Specifically, Chinese researchers emphasise the necessity of funds, while researchers from first-tier universities place more value on networking channels. Disciplinary differences for the prerequisite of proximity were also discovered. Based on these results, discussion and implications were referred. Further suggestions on research collaboration studies are rendered.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</originId><author><name>Heidi Marjonen</name></author><updated>1526418000000</updated><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>de22e66e</fingerprint><published>1526418000000</published><title>Early prenatal alcohol exposure alters imprinted gene expression in placenta and embryo in a mouse model</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi Marjonen, Mia Toivonen, Laura Lahti, Nina Kaminen-Ahola&lt;/p&gt;
Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can harm the embryonic development and cause life-long consequences in offspring’s health. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of PAE we have used a mouse model of early alcohol exposure, which is based on maternal &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; ingestion of 10% (v/v) ethanol for the first eight days of gestation (GD 0.5–8.5). Owing to the detected postnatal growth-restricted phenotype in the offspring of this mouse model and both prenatal and postnatal growth restriction in alcohol-exposed humans, we focused on imprinted genes &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like growth factor 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Igf2)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Paternally expressed gene 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Peg3)&lt;/i&gt;, which all are known to be involved in embryonic and placental growth and development. We studied the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation level at the &lt;i&gt;Igf2/H19&lt;/i&gt; imprinting control region (ICR), &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; differentially methylated region 1, &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; ICR and &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; ICR in 9.5 embryonic days old (E9.5) embryos and placentas by using MassARRAY EpiTYPER. To determine alcohol-induced alterations globally, we also examined methylation in long interspersed nuclear elements (Line-1) in E9.5 placentas. We did not observe any significant alcohol-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. We explored effects of PAE on gene expression of E9.5 embryos as well as E9.5 and E16.5 placentas by using quantitative PCR. The expression of growth promoter gene &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; was decreased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas. The expression of negative growth controller &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt; was significantly increased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos compared to controls, and conversely, a trend of decreased expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas were observed. Furthermore, increased &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos was also detected. Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b90:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi Marjonen, Mia Toivonen, Laura Lahti, Nina Kaminen-Ahola&lt;/p&gt;

Perinatal depression is common, and left untreated can have significant and long-lasting consequences for women, their children and their families. Migrant women are at particular risk of perinatal depression as a result of a multitude of stressors experienced before, during and after migration. Identification of perinatal depression among migrant women—particularly those living in low- and middle-income regions—remains challenging, partly due to the lack of locally-validated and culturally appropriate screens tools. This study formally validates Burmese and Sgaw Karen versions of the &lt;i&gt;Refugee Health Screener-15&lt;/i&gt; (RHS-15) as a screening tool for perinatal depression among migrant women living on the Thai-Myanmar border. The &lt;i&gt;Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of DSM-IV Disorders&lt;/i&gt; (SCID) was used as the gold-standard comparator. Complete results were obtained for 235 Burmese-speaking and 275 Sgaw Karen-speaking women. Despite displaying reasonable psychometric properties, a number of shortcomings associated with the RHS-15 limited its utility in this setting. The Likert-type response categories of the RHS-15 proved problematic in this low-literacy population. Combined with the relative superiority and greater ease of administration of the SCID, the RHS-15 is not recommended as the tool of choice for detecting perinatal depression in this setting.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163887e5d08:6c1ae76:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gracia Fellmeth, Emma Plugge, Mina Fazel, Prakaykaew Charunwattana, François Nosten, Raymond Fitzpatrick, Julie A.

This study aims to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCa with bioinformatics. Methods: Original gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE64318 and GSE46602 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted differential screens of the expression of genes (DEGs) between two groups using the R software limma package. The interactions between the differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted and merged with the target genes. Co-expression of the miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected to construct the mRNA-miRNA and -lncRNA interaction networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and the transcription factors were annotated. The expression of hub genes in the TCGA datasets was verified to improve the reliability of our analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that 60 miRNAs, 1578 mRNAs and 61 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks were composed of 5 miRNA nodes, 13 lncRNA nodes, and 45 mRNA nodes. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the nuclei and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of transcription, related to sequence-specific DNA binding, and participated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. These pathways are related to cancer and focal adhesion signalling pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs, 6 lncRNAs, 6 mRNAs and 2 TFs play important regulatory roles in the interaction network. The expression levels of EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1, DLG4, TGFBR1 and KIT were significantly different between PCa and normal prostate tissue. Conclusion: Based on the current study, large-scale effects of interrelated mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs were revealed and a model for predicting the mechanism of PCa was provided. This study provides new insight for the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of PCa and valuable clues for further research.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636a914ef8:44b6aff:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Purpose: Prostate cancer (PCa) causes a common male urinary system malignant tumour, and the molecular mechanisms of PCa remain poorly understood.

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1.

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood. Finally, we found ANKK1 expression in regenerative fibers of muscles from dystrophic patients. Future studies in ANKK1 biology and the pathological response of muscles will reveal whether this protein is a novel muscle disease biomarker.</content></content></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4851.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4851.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>Paul J.

&lt;i&gt;Lactococcus lactis&lt;/i&gt; is an ovoid bacterium that forms filaments during planktonic and biofilm lifestyles by uncoupling cell division from cell elongation. In this work, we investigate the role of the leading peptidoglycan synthase PBP2b that is dedicated to cell elongation in ovococci. We show that the localization of a fluorescent derivative of PBP2b remains associated to the septal region and superimposed with structural changes of FtsZ during both vegetative growth and filamentation indicating that PBP2b remains intimately associated to the division machinery during the whole cell cycle. In addition, we show that PBP2b-negative cells of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lactis&lt;/i&gt; are not only defective in peripheral growth; they are also affected in septum positioning. This septation defect does not simply result from the absence of the protein in the cell growth machinery since it is also observed when PBP2b-deficient cells are complemented by a catalytically inactive variant of PBP2b. Finally, we show that round cells resulting from β-lactam treatment are not altered in septation, suggesting that shape elongation as such is not a major determinant for selection of the division site. Altogether, we propose that the specific PBP2b transpeptidase activity at the septum plays an important role for tagging future division sites during &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lactis&lt;/i&gt; cell cycle.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2345:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Blandine David, Marie-Clémence Duchêne, Gabrielle Laurie Haustenne, Daniel Pérez-Núñez, Marie-Pierre Chapot-Chartier, Xavier De Bolle, Eric Guédon, Pascal Hols, Bernard Hallet&lt;/p&gt;

Mortality is higher for adults admitted to hospital and for babies born on weekends compared to weekdays. This study compares in-hospital mortality and in children admitted to hospital on weekends and weekdays. Details for all acute medical admissions to hospitals in Scotland for children aged ≤16 years between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2000 and 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2013 were obtained. Death was linked to day of admission. There were 570,403 acute medical admissions and 334 children died, including 83 who died after an admission on Saturday or Sunday and 251 who died following admission between Monday and Friday. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a child dying after admission on a weekend compared to weekday was 1.03 [95% CI 0.80 to 1.32]. The OR for a child admitted over the weekend requiring intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) care was 1.24 [1.16 to 1.32], but the absolute number of admissions to HDU and ICU per day were similar on weekends and weekdays. We see no evidence of increased in-hospital paediatric mortality after admission on a weekend. The increased risk for admission to ITU or HDU with more serious illness over weekends is explained by fewer less serious admissions.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122a:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Barwise-Munro, Maryam Al-Mahtot, Steve Turner&lt;/p&gt;

Yu&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic drug, has activity in preclinical models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Potential mechanisms of action include degrading constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) or inhibiting other drug-resistance pathways (e.g., Wnt-signaling). Published pharmacokinetics data suggests that niclosamide has poor oral bioavailability, potentially limiting its use as a cancer drug. Therefore, we launched a Phase I study testing oral niclosamide in combination with enzalutamide, for longer and at higher doses than those used to treat helminthic infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a Phase I dose-escalation study testing oral niclosamide plus standard-dose enzalutamide in men with metastatic CRPC previously treated with abiraterone. Niclosamide was given three-times-daily (TID) at the following dose-levels: 500, 1000 or 1500mg. The primary objective was to assess safety. Secondary objectives, included measuring AR-V expression from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the AdnaTest assay, evaluating PSA changes and determining niclosamide’s pharmacokinetic profile.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;20 patients screened and 5 enrolled after passing all screening procedures. 13(65%) patients had detectable CTCs, but only one was AR-V+. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 3 patients on the 500mg TID cohort; however, both (N = 2) subjects on the 1000mg TID cohort experienced DLTs (prolonged grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; and colitis). The maximum plasma concentration ranged from 35.7–82 ng/mL and was not consistently above the minimum effective concentration in preclinical studies. There were no PSA declines in any enrolled subject. Because plasma concentrations at the maximum tolerated dose (500mg TID) were not consistently above the expected therapeutic threshold, the Data Safety Monitoring Board closed the study for futility.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Oral niclosamide could not be escalated above 500mg TID, and plasma concentrations were not consistently above the threshold shown to inhibit growth in CRPC models.

These results indicate that exposure to multiple parasites influences the rate and type of host-parasite coevolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197672</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197672</originId><author><name>Wei Wang</name></author><updated>1527109200000</updated><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197672</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>1d934016</fingerprint><published>1527109200000</published><title>Anthropometry-based 24-h urinary creatinine excretion reference for Chinese children</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197672</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wang, Cong Du, Laixiang Lin, Wen Chen, Long Tan, Jun Shen, Elizabeth N.

To establish 24-h urinary creatinine excretion reference ranges based on anthropometry in healthy Chinese children, a cross-sectional survey was conducted using twice-sampled 24-h urine and anthropometric variables. Age- and sex-specific 24-h creatinine excretion reference ranges (crude and related to individual anthropometric variables) were derived. During October 2013 and May 2014, urine samples were collected. Anthropometric variables were measured in the first survey. Data of 710 children (377 boys and 333 girls) aged 8–13 years who completed the study were analyzed. No significant difference was observed in 24-h urine volumes between the two samples (median [interquartile range): 855.0 [600.0–1272.0) mL vs. 900.0 [660.0–1220.0) mL, P = 0.277). The mean 24-h urine creatinine excretion was regarded as representative of absolute daily creatinine excretion in children. Sex-specific, body-weight-adjusted creatinine excretion reference values were 15.3 mg/kg/day (0.1353 mmol/kg/day) for boys and 14.3 mg/kg/day (0.1264 mmol/kg/day) for girls. Differences were significant between boys and girls within the same age group but not across different age groups within the same sex. Ideal 24-h creatinine excretion values for height were derived for potential determination of the creatinine height index. These data can serve as reference ranges to calculate ratios of analyte to creatinine. The creatinine height index can be used to assess somatic protein status.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f232f:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wang, Cong Du, Laixiang Lin, Wen Chen, Long Tan, Jun Shen, Elizabeth N.

Background &lt;p&gt;Recent studies showed that increased fresh fruit consumption is significantly associated with lower risks of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD); other studies suggested that albuminuria is associated with diabetes, hypertension, and CVD. Therefore, we hypothesized that lower fresh fruit consumption is associated with higher risk of incident albuminuria among Chinese adults in rural areas, where fresh fruit consumption level is very low and prevalence of albuminuria is high.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis in a village-based cohort study of 3574 participants aged ≥ 30 years from the Handan Eye Study conducted from 2006 to 2013. Albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 35.4% of the participants never or rarely consumed fresh fruits, and 33.9, 21.6, and 9.1% consumed fresh fruits 1–3 times/month, 1–2 times/week, and ≥ 3 times/week, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 5.6 years, albuminuria developed in 17.6% (n = 629) of the participants. Compared with participants who consumed fresh fruits ≥ 3 times/week, the multivariable adjustment odds ratios (ORs) for incident albuminuria associated with fruit consumption 1–2 times/week, 1–3 times/month, and no or rare consumption were 1.58 (95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.05–2.40), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.17–2.58), and 1.78 (95% CI, 1.20–2.64), respectively. After excluding participants with diabetes, the association remained significant.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Lower fresh fruit consumption was significantly associated with higher risk of incident albuminuria, and fresh fruit consumption frequency could be an essential intervention target to prevent albuminuria in rural China.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e24:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jiangping Wen, Jie Hao, Ye Zhang, Yuanbo Liang, Sizhen Li, Fenghua Wang, Xinrong Duan, Xiaohui Yang, Kai Cao, Bingsong Wang, Xinxin Lu, Ningli Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. Bovine NK-lysins, a type of AMP, have been predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells. Bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides demonstrate antimicrobial activity against various bacterial pathogens, including several involved in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in cattle; however, such studies are yet to be performed with one important contributor to the BRDC, &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Thirty-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the functional region helices 2 and 3 of bovine NK-lysins NK1, NK2A, NK2B, and NK2C were evaluated for killing activity on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Among four peptides, NK2A and NK2C showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested. All four NK-lysin peptides induced rapid plasma membrane depolarization in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; at two concentrations tested. However, based on propidium iodide uptake, only NK2A and NK2C appeared capable of causing structural damage to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; plasma membrane. Confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy further suggested NK-lysin-induced damage to the plasma membrane. Taken together, the findings in this study suggest that plasma membrane depolarization alone was insufficient to induce lethality, but disruption/permeabilization of the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; plasma membrane was the cause of lethality.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rohana P.

However, in contrast to the chromosome-bound kinetochore structure, how the diffusion-prone cortical machinery is organized to generate large spindle-pulling forces remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a light-induced reconstitution system in human cells. We find that induced cortical targeting of NuMA, but not dynein, is sufficient for spindle pulling. This spindle-pulling activity requires dynein-dynactin recruitment by NuMA&apos;s N-terminal long arm, dynein-based astral microtubule gliding, and NuMA&apos;s direct microtubule-binding activities. Importantly, we demonstrate that cortical NuMA assembles specialized focal structures that cluster multiple force-generating modules to generate cooperative spindle-pulling forces. This clustering activity of NuMA is required for spindle positioning, but not for spindle-pole focusing.

However, in contrast to the chromosome-bound kinetochore structure, how the diffusion-prone cortical machinery is organized to generate large spindle-pulling forces remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a light-induced reconstitution system in human cells. We find that induced cortical targeting of NuMA, but not dynein, is sufficient for spindle pulling. This spindle-pulling activity requires dynein-dynactin recruitment by NuMA&apos;s N-terminal long arm, dynein-based astral microtubule gliding, and NuMA&apos;s direct microtubule-binding activities. Importantly, we demonstrate that cortical NuMA assembles specialized focal structures that cluster multiple force-generating modules to generate cooperative spindle-pulling forces. This clustering activity of NuMA is required for spindle positioning, but not for spindle-pole focusing.

solvent-ligand interactions play a major role in nanocrystal synthesis, dispersion
formulation and assembly, there is currently no direct method to study this.
Here we examine the broadening of 1H NMR resonances associated with
bound ligands, and turn this poorly understood descriptor into a tool to assess
solvent-ligand interactions. We show that the line broadening has both a homogeneous
and a heterogeneous component. The former is nanocrystal-size dependent and the
latter results from solvent-ligand interactions. Our model is supported by
experimental and theoretical evidence that correlates broad NMR lines with poor
ligand solvation. This correlation is found across a wide range of solvents,
extending from water to hexane, for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic ligand
types, and for a multitude of oxide, sulfide and selenide nanocrystals. Our findings
thus put forward NMR line shape analysis as an indispensable tool to form,
investigate and manipulate nanocolloids.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Solvent-Ligand_Interactions_in_Colloidal_Nanocrystals/6447884</href></item></alternate><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3f27f8e3</fingerprint><published>1528243200000</published><title>Solvent-Ligand Interactions in Colloidal Nanocrystals</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Although
