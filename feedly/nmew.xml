Background &lt;p&gt;Segmentation of heterogeneous patient populations into parsimonious and relatively homogenous groups with similar healthcare needs can facilitate healthcare resource planning and development of effective integrated healthcare interventions for each segment. We aimed to apply a data-driven, healthcare utilization-based clustering analysis to segment a regional health system patient population and validate its discriminative ability on 4-year longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality data.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted data from the Singapore Health Services Electronic Health Intelligence System, an electronic medical record database that included healthcare utilization (inpatient admissions, specialist outpatient clinic visits, emergency department visits, and primary care clinic visits), mortality, diseases, and demographics for all adult Singapore residents who resided in and had a healthcare encounter with our regional health system in 2012. Hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward’s linkage) and K-means cluster analysis using age and healthcare utilization data in 2012 were applied to segment the selected population. These segments were compared using their demographics (other than age) and morbidities in 2012, and longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 146,999 subjects, five distinct patient segments “Young, healthy”; “Middle age, healthy”; “Stable, chronic disease”; “Complicated chronic disease” and “Frequent admitters” were identified. Healthcare utilization patterns in 2012, morbidity patterns and demographics differed significantly across all segments. The “Frequent admitters” segment had the smallest number of patients (1.79% of the population) but consumed 69% of inpatient admissions, 77% of specialist outpatient visits, 54% of emergency department visits, and 23% of primary care clinic visits in 2012. 11.5% and 31.2% of this segment has end stage renal failure and malignancy respectively. The validity of cluster-analysis derived segments is supported by discriminative ability for longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016. Incident rate ratios for healthcare utilization and Cox hazards ratio for mortality increased as patient segments increased in complexity. Patients in the “Frequent admitters” segment accounted for a disproportionate healthcare utilization and 8.16 times higher mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data-driven clustering analysis on a general patient population in Singapore identified five patient segments with distinct longitudinal healthcare utilization patterns and mortality risk to provide an evidence-based segmentation of a regional health system’s healthcare needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195243</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>dfc2be54</fingerprint><author><name>Lian Leng Low</name></author><updated>1522962000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195243</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Leng Low, Shi Yan, Yu Heng Kwan, Chuen Seng Tan, Julian Thumboo&lt;/p&gt;

Ruwald, Tommi Bo Lindhardt, Gunnar H. Gislason, Christian Torp-Pedersen, Jannik L. Pallisgaard&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;The management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with rate-lowering or anti-arrhythmic drugs has markedly changed over the last decade, but it is unknown how these changes have affected patients with NVAF with a permanent pacemaker (PPM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Through Danish nationwide registries, patients with NVAF and a PPM were identified from 2001 to 2012. Changes in concomitant pharmacotherapy and comorbidities were tested using the Cochran–Armitage trend test and linear regression. Patients with NVAF were identified to calculate the proportional amount of PPM implants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 12,231 NVAF patients with a PPM were included in the study, 55.6% of which were men. Median age was 78 years (interquartile range 70–84). From 2001 to 2012, the number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased from 850 to 1344, while the number of NVAF patients increased from 67,478 to 127,261. Thus, the proportional amount of NVAF patients with a PPM decreased from 1.3% to 1.1% (p = 0.015). Overall 45.9% had atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than one year and the proportion declined from 55.5% to 42.4% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Diabetes mellitus increased from 7.2% to 16.8% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Heart failure (HF) decreased from 36.7% to 29.3% (p = 0.010) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 32.4% to 26.1% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Beta-blocker use increased from 38.1% to 58.0% (p &amp;lt;0.001), while digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drug use decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the absolute number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased while the proportional amount decreased. The number of NVAF patients receiving a PPM within one year of AF diagnosis decreased. The prevalence of DM increased, while the prevalence of HF and IHD was high but decreasing.

Background &lt;p&gt;The management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with rate-lowering or anti-arrhythmic drugs has markedly changed over the last decade, but it is unknown how these changes have affected patients with NVAF with a permanent pacemaker (PPM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Through Danish nationwide registries, patients with NVAF and a PPM were identified from 2001 to 2012. Changes in concomitant pharmacotherapy and comorbidities were tested using the Cochran–Armitage trend test and linear regression. Patients with NVAF were identified to calculate the proportional amount of PPM implants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 12,231 NVAF patients with a PPM were included in the study, 55.6% of which were men. Median age was 78 years (interquartile range 70–84). From 2001 to 2012, the number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased from 850 to 1344, while the number of NVAF patients increased from 67,478 to 127,261. Thus, the proportional amount of NVAF patients with a PPM decreased from 1.3% to 1.1% (p = 0.015). Overall 45.9% had atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than one year and the proportion declined from 55.5% to 42.4% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Diabetes mellitus increased from 7.2% to 16.8% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Heart failure (HF) decreased from 36.7% to 29.3% (p = 0.010) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 32.4% to 26.1% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Beta-blocker use increased from 38.1% to 58.0% (p &amp;lt;0.001), while digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drug use decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the absolute number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased while the proportional amount decreased.

Preservation of residual hearing after cochlear implant is an important issue with regards to hearing performance. Various methods of steroid administration have been widely used in clinical practice to reduce inflammation and preserve residual hearing. Here we compare the effect of different routes of dexamethasone administration on intracochlear inflammation and residual hearing in guinea pig ears. Dexamethasone was delivered into the guinea pigs either through intracochlear, intratympanic or systemic route. The intracochlear concentration of dexamethasone, residual hearing, inflammatory cytokines and histopathologic changes were evaluated over time. A higher intracochlear dexamethasone concentration was observed after intracochlear administration than through the other routes. Residual hearing was better preserved with local dexamethasone administration as was supported by the reduced inflammatory cytokines, more hair cell survival and less severe intracochlear fibrosis and ossification concurrently seen in the local delivery group than in the systemic group. The results demonstrate that local dexamethasone delivery can reduce intracochlear inflammation and preserve residual hearing better than in systemically administered dexamethasone.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>7d78ed53</fingerprint><author><name>Ah-Ra Lyu</name></author><updated>1522443600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ah-Ra Lyu, Dong Hyun Kim, Seung Hun Lee, Dong-Sik Shin, Sun-Ae Shin, Yong-Ho Park&lt;/p&gt;

The present study is aimed at assessing the feasibility of delivering the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine to girls through a school-based program in Hong Kong, as well as to examine the facilitators and barriers associated with their participation. We approached 1,229 eligible girls aged 9 to 14 at eight schools in Hong Kong to join the program and then delivered the bivalent HPV vaccine at 0 and 6 months over the course of one school year. The students and their parents completed separate questionnaires to indicate their decision on whether or not to participate, and to assess their knowledge of cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine. The overall vaccine uptake was 81.4% (1,000/1,229) for the first dose and 80.8% (993/1,229) for the second dose. Parents and students were given separate questionnaires and asked whether or not they would like to participate in the vaccination program. 87.1% (1,010/1,160) of parents and 84.9% (974/1,147) of students indicated that they would join the program. The reasons associated with parents’ decision not to vaccinate their daughters primarily included concerns around side effects and safety. Multivariate regression analysis showed that parents who thought that the vaccine would protect their daughter from getting cervical cancer (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.39–7.15, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01), and those who reported having a doctor’s recommendation (OR = 4.54, 95% CI = 1.05–19.57, p &amp;lt; .05) were more likely to join the program. In contrast, parents who had never heard of the vaccine (OR = .15, 95% CI = .03–.71, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .02), those who were willing to pay more than HK$2,000 for the vaccine (OR = .39, 95% CI = .19–.81, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05), or had a preference to access it through a private clinic (OR = .44, 95% CI = .26–.75, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01) were significantly less likely to allow their daughter to join the program. Delivery of the HPV vaccine with high uptake rate in a school setting is feasible in Hong Kong. Engaging key stakeholders including school administrators, teachers and community physicians, and providing relevant information on safety and vaccine effectiveness to parents were important to the success of the program.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194159</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>f40dca57</fingerprint><author><name>Winnie Wing Yan Yuen</name></author><updated>1521147600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194159</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Winnie Wing Yan Yuen, Albert Lee, Paul K.

Parents and students were given separate questionnaires and asked whether or not they would like to participate in the vaccination program. 87.1% (1,010/1,160) of parents and 84.9% (974/1,147) of students indicated that they would join the program. The reasons associated with parents’ decision not to vaccinate their daughters primarily included concerns around side effects and safety. Multivariate regression analysis showed that parents who thought that the vaccine would protect their daughter from getting cervical cancer (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.39–7.15, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01), and those who reported having a doctor’s recommendation (OR = 4.54, 95% CI = 1.05–19.57, p &amp;lt; .05) were more likely to join the program. In contrast, parents who had never heard of the vaccine (OR = .15, 95% CI = .03–.71, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .02), those who were willing to pay more than HK$2,000 for the vaccine (OR = .39, 95% CI = .19–.81, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05), or had a preference to access it through a private clinic (OR = .44, 95% CI = .26–.75, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01) were significantly less likely to allow their daughter to join the program. Delivery of the HPV vaccine with high uptake rate in a school setting is feasible in Hong Kong. Engaging key stakeholders including school administrators, teachers and community physicians, and providing relevant information on safety and vaccine effectiveness to parents were important to the success of the program.</description><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194159</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16262a9dfb1:5a33ca5:34f43e70</id><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>Titanium Nitride (TiN)

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype E almost exclusively occurs in African people, and its presence is more commonly associated with the development of chronic HBV (CHB) infection. Moreover, an epidemiological link has been found between the distribution of HBV genotype E infection and African countries with high incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma. As part of a programme for the health assessment of migrants, we evaluated 358 young African subjects for HBV infection; 58.1% (208/358) were positive for an HBV marker, and 54 (25.5%) had CHB. Eighty-one percent of the CHB subjects were infected with HBV genotype E, with a median serum HBV-DNA of 3.2 (IQR: 2.7–3.6) logIU/ml. All patients had high serum HBsAg titres (10,899 [range 5,359–20,272] IU/ml), and no correlation was found between HBsAg titres and HBV-DNA plasma levels. RT sequence analysis showed the presence of a number of immune escape mutations: strains from all of the patients had a serine at HBsAg position 140; 3 also had T116N, Y100C, and P142L+S143L substitutions; and 1 had a G112R substitution. Six (18%) patients had stop-codons at position 216. In 5 of the 9 (26.5%) CHB patients, ultrasound liver biopsy, quantification of total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA, and RT/HBsAg sequencing were performed. The median (IQR) total intrahepatic HBV-DNA was 766 (753–1139) copies/1000 cells, and the median (IQR) cccDNA was 17 (10–27) copies/1000 cells. Correlations were observed for both total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA with serum HBV-DNA, while no correlation was found for the HBsAg titres. A difference of 2.5/1,000 nucleotides was found in the HBsAg sequences obtained from plasma and from liver tissue, with 3 cases of possible viral anatomical compartmentalization. In conclusion, a high rate of CHB infection due to the E genotype was demonstrated in a group of immigrants from Western Africa. An analysis of the viral strains obtained showed the virological characteristics of immune escape, which may be the cause of viral replication persistence. Moreover, a fair percentage of stop codon mutations were found. The lack of correlation between HBsAg titres and plasma or intrahepatic HBV-DNA found in these subjects suggests a pathway of virus production that is not linked to HBsAg secretion. Studies with a larger number of patients with CHB due to the E genotype are advisable to corroborate these observations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195045</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>65b3ef36</fingerprint><author><name>Vincenzo Malagnino</name></author><updated>1522357200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195045</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vincenzo Malagnino, Romina Salpini, Gaetano Maffongelli, Arianna Battisti, Lavinia Fabeni, Lorenzo Piermatteo, Luna Colagrossi, Vanessa Fini, Alessandra Ricciardi, Cesare Sarrecchia, Carlo Federico Perno, Massimo Andreoni, Valentina Svicher, Loredana Sarmati&lt;/p&gt;

The biological pacemaker approach is an alternative to cardiac electronic pacemakers. Its main objective is to create pacemaking activity from added or modified distribution of spontaneous cells in the myocardium. This paper aims to assess how automaticity strength of pacemaker cells (i.e. their ability to maintain robust spontaneous activity with fast rate and to drive neighboring quiescent cells) and structural linear anisotropy, combined with density and spatial distribution of pacemaker cells, may affect the macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker. A stochastic algorithm was used to randomly distribute pacemaker cells, with various densities and spatial distributions, in a semi-continuous mathematical model. Simulations of the model showed that stronger automaticity allows onset of spontaneous activity for lower densities and more homogeneous spatial distributions, displayed more central foci, less variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for similar spatial patterns, but more variability in those same variables for dissimilar spatial patterns. Compared their isotropic counterparts, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; anisotropic monolayers had less central foci and displayed more variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for both similar and dissimilar spatial patterns.

To grow straight and upright, plants need to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation (tilting) experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observations of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>7ec64172</fingerprint><author><name>Renaud Bastien</name></author><updated>1522357200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Renaud Bastien, Olivia Guayasamin, Stéphane Douady, Bruno Moulia&lt;/p&gt;

The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.</description><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529839:34f43e70</id><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1522950073000</published><title>Tumor-agnostic therapy gets on TRK</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/45.4.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Kiberstis, P.

Bats lower the emission SPL when approaching a target. The SPL reduction has been explained by intensity compensation which implies that bats adjust the emission SPL to perceive the retuning echoes at the same level. For a better understanding of this control mechanism we recorded the echolocation signals of four &lt;i&gt;Myotis myotis&lt;/i&gt; with an onboard microphone when foraging in the passive mode for rustling mealworms offered in two feeding dishes with different target strength, and determined the reduction rate for the emission SPL and the increase rate for the SPL of the returning echoes. When approaching the dish with higher target strength bats started the reduction of the emission SPL at a larger reaction distance (1.05 ± 0.21 m) and approached it with a lower reduction rate of 7.2 dB/halving of distance (hd), thus producing a change of echo rate at the ears of + 4 dB/hd. At the weaker target reaction distance was shorter (0.71 ± 0.24 m) and the reduction rate (9.1 dB/hd) was higher, producing a change of echo rate of—1.2 dB/hd. Independent of dish type, bats lowered the emission SPL by about 26 dB on average. In one bat where the echo SPL from both targets could be measured, the reduction of emission SPL was triggered when the echo SPL surpassed a similar threshold value around 41–42 dB. Echo SPL was not adjusted at a constant value indicating that &lt;i&gt;Myotis myotis&lt;/i&gt; and most likely all other bats do not use a closed loop system for intensity compensation when approaching a target of interest.

The growing area of European hazelnut (&lt;i&gt;Corylus avellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is increasing, as well as the number of producing countries, and there is a pressing need for new improved cultivars. Hazelnut conventional breeding process is slow, due to the length of juvenile phase and the high heterozygosity level. The development of genetic linkage maps and the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to QTL (quantitative trait loci) of agronomic interest are essential tools for speeding up the selection of seedlings carrying desired traits through marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to enrich a previous linkage map and confirm QTL related to time of leaf budburst, using an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; population obtained by crossing Tonda Gentile delle Langhe with Merveille de Bollwiller. Genotyping-by-Sequencing was used to identify a total of 9,999 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Well saturated linkage maps were constructed for each parent using the double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. A reciprocal translocation was detected in Tonda Gentile delle Langhe between two non-homologous chromosomes.

The growing area of European hazelnut (&lt;i&gt;Corylus avellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is increasing, as well as the number of producing countries, and there is a pressing need for new improved cultivars. Hazelnut conventional breeding process is slow, due to the length of juvenile phase and the high heterozygosity level. The development of genetic linkage maps and the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to QTL (quantitative trait loci) of agronomic interest are essential tools for speeding up the selection of seedlings carrying desired traits through marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to enrich a previous linkage map and confirm QTL related to time of leaf budburst, using an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; population obtained by crossing Tonda Gentile delle Langhe with Merveille de Bollwiller. Genotyping-by-Sequencing was used to identify a total of 9,999 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Well saturated linkage maps were constructed for each parent using the double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. A reciprocal translocation was detected in Tonda Gentile delle Langhe between two non-homologous chromosomes. Applying a bioinformatic approach, we were able to disentangle ‘pseudo-linkage’ between markers, removing markers around the translocation breakpoints and obtain a linear order of the markers for the two chromosomes arms, for each linkage group involved in the translocation. Twenty-nine QTL for time of leaf budburst were identified, including a stably expressed region on LG_02 of the Tonda Gentile delle Langhe map. The stability of these QTL and their coding sequence content indicates promise for the identification of specific chromosomal regions carrying key genes involved in leaf budburst.</description><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195408</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16277feec6e:11ab9b:a077e55f</id><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004274</link><unread>True</unread><title>Dynamic frontotemporal systems process space and time in working memory</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth L.

How do we rapidly process incoming streams of information in working memory, a cognitive mechanism central to human behavior? Dominant views of working memory focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but human hippocampal recordings provide a neurophysiological signature distinct from the PFC. Are these regions independent, or do they interact in the service of working memory? We addressed this core issue in behavior by recording directly from frontotemporal sites in humans performing a visuospatial working memory task that operationalizes the types of identity and spatiotemporal information we encounter every day. Theta band oscillations drove bidirectional interactions between the PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL; including the hippocampus). MTL theta oscillations directed the PFC preferentially during the processing of spatiotemporal information, while PFC theta oscillations directed the MTL for all types of information being processed in working memory. These findings reveal an MTL theta mechanism for processing space and time and a domain-general PFC theta mechanism, providing evidence that rapid, dynamic MTL–PFC interactions underlie working memory for everyday experiences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5Z-HrtFgn-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1522431724528</recrawled><crawled>1522431618158</crawled><updated>1522443600000</updated><fingerprint>5d873c0a</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004274</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004274</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides.

The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence.

The signaling scaffold protein GIT1 is expressed widely throughout the brain, but its function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains elusive. Mice lacking GIT1 have been proposed as a model for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, due to alterations in basal locomotor activity as well as paradoxical locomotor suppression by the psychostimulant amphetamine. Since we had previously shown that GIT1-knockout mice have normal locomotor activity, here we examined GIT1-deficient mice for ADHD-like behavior in more detail, and find neither hyperactivity nor amphetamine-induced locomotor suppression. Instead, GIT1-deficient mice exhibit profound learning and memory defects and reduced synaptic structural plasticity, consistent with an intellectual disability phenotype. We conclude that loss of GIT1 alone is insufficient to drive a robust ADHD phenotype in distinct strains of mice. In contrast, multiple learning and memory defects have been observed here and in other studies using distinct GIT1-knockout lines, consistent with a predominant intellectual disability phenotype related to altered synaptic structural plasticity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194350</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>f97b806f</fingerprint><author><name>Amanda C.

Reporter virus is a versatile tool to visualize and to analyze virus infections. However, for flaviviruses, it is difficult to maintain the inserted reporter genes on the viral genome, limiting its use in several studies that require homogeneous virus particles and several rounds of virus replication. Here, we showed that flanking inserted GFP genes on both sides with ribosome-skipping 2A sequences improved the stability and the consistency of their fluorescent signals for dengue-virus-serotype 2 (DENV2) reporter viruses. The reporter viruses can infect known susceptible mammalian cell lines and primary CD14+ human monocytes. This design can accommodate several fluorescent protein genes, enabling the generation of multi-color DENV2-16681 reporter viruses with comparable replication capabilities, as demonstrated by their abilities to maintain their fluorescent intensities during co-infections and to exclude superinfections regardless of the fluorescent tags.

All you have to do to appreciate the horrors of this field is to step into a lab that does it for a living: stacks and stacks and stacks of plates, each with a slightly different set of conditions (buffers, concentrations, additives, protein construct, and son on) to try, once again, to get a protein crystal that diffracts well enough for structure determination. It’s especially tricky to get the ones with your small molecule sitting inside them at its binding site, but when you do, the payoffs can be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing such things at the quality levels needed, though, is an absolute black art. There are trends (sometimes), better ideas about starting points (sometimes), rational modifications of the protein sequence to increase your chances (sometimes), but in the end, it still comes down to relentless empirical try-it-and-see. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25971&quot;&gt;latest paper&lt;/a&gt; (writeup by &lt;em&gt;C&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i15/Cryo-electron-microscopy-reveals-protein.html?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=CEN&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is looking at a well-known protein crystal (glucose isomerase) that is also well known to exist it two polymorphic forms (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/28/down-at-the-crystal-surface&quot;&gt;that last post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject for more on polymorphs). What isn’t well known is why it forms these particular two types of crystals and how that happens. In virtually every case of polymorphism, we have little or no clue about such things, and I’m very glad to see clues starting to be unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these authors have done is to start the crystallization process in ammonium sulfate solution and then freeze the solutions (liquid nitrogen) at various time points, imaging the crystals thus found by electron microscopy. And there are some surprises. At the twenty-second time point, there are already “nanorod” crystals forming, which are, on the average, &lt;em&gt;two protein molecules wide and twelve molecules long&lt;/em&gt;. You are not going to get too much earlier in the crystal formation process than that. The concentration of the nanorods increases over time. However, their length does not: they seem stuck at this size. They do start to associate into fibrils as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other things happening as well. There are other species in there (trimer, tetramers, single-file chains), and after about thirty minutes you can also see faceted nanocrystals of the two known bulk polymorphs, one prismatic and rodlike and one rhombic. The smallest of each are in the 100 nM range along their shortest edges. Trying the experiment using PEG instead of ammonium sulfate (another known set of conditions for producing these protein crystals) shows that the useful concentration range for the additive is much narrower, but in both cases, at the low end of the range you get rhombic, and at the high end you get prismatic. With PEG, though, if you keep pushing it, you get no crystals at all, but rather an amorphous gel-like state. And in none of the PEG experiments did they ever observe the nanorods seen in ammonium sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Nature, C&amp;amp;E News&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-264x300.jpeg 264w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals-300x341.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Crystals.jpeg 700w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13431&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gelation pathway seemed to involve fibril formation as well, which looked in the earlier experiments like it might be a precursor to formation of the rhombic crystals. Weirdly, the authors found that you can take some of that gel and use it to nucleate another protein solution, one that would otherwise form only the rhombic crystals, and form the prismatic crystals with it instead (which is a bizarre thought to me, and probably to a lot of other people who don’t crystallize things for a living). You actually see the crystals growing out of the surface of the lump of gelatinous protein gorp, as shown at right. This is order out of chaos, for sure; I’ll bet that the temperature of the solution at that interface is changing just to make the thermodynamics of all that loss of entropy work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the early stages of crystal formation like this allowed the authors to come up with all the plausible models of the nanorods and compare those to experimental data. One clearly matches better than the rest of them, so now we know what the earliest crystal formation contacts are, and can start to explain why. The preferred mode of contact buries a lot more negative charges in the protein surface, and the paper goes into detail about how this can explain the effects of sulfate ions in the solution versus PEG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it appears that the prismatic crystals (from ammonium sulfate) are made up of bunches of nanorods, rather than growing molecule-by-molecule, which is also contrary to the mental pictures that many of us have. Meanwhile, the rhombic crystals grow more like the traditional picture, monomer by monomer. The nanorod form, though, can also be trapped in a metastable fibril state, starting off as individual fibrils and going on to a gel, with too high an activation energy to dissociate and form prismatic crystals. But its surface can nucleate the formation of such crystals (as in the above photo). At really high PEG concentrations you get a different gel, which is not composed of fibrils, and seems to be a complete dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they don’t see any evidence for, though, is another mode predicted by theory (and which I mentioned in the last post on this stuff): formation of phase-separated nanodroplets that then crystallize. Those nanodroplets take us back to the hot topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;protein condensates&lt;/a&gt; inside cells, and perhaps its a good thing that they’re not invariably precursors to forming protein crystals (!) That is very likely the reason that such condensates seem to feature intrinsically disordered proteins as well, to avoid the crystallization problem. . .&lt;/p&gt;

Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands. Forests showed less resistance to climate stress and a higher chance of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions. If this scenario occurs, the forest ecosystems would have less chance of adaptation compared to savannas or grasslands because of their narrow climate niche. Therefore, we can conclude that a possible consolidation of non-analogous climatic conditions would lead to a loss of resilience in the forest ecosystem, significantly increasing the chance of a critical transition event to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover (e.g., savanna or grassland).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194654</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>7b32af6e</fingerprint><author><name>Luciano J.

Background &lt;p&gt;This study explored spatial-temporal variation in diagnoses of gonorrhoea to identify and quantify endemic areas and clusters in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes of partner notification (PN) across England, UK.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Endemic areas and clusters were identified using a two-stage analysis with Kulldorff’s scan statistics (SaTScan).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2,571,838 tests, 53,547 diagnoses were gonorrhoea positive (positivity = 2.08%). The proportion of diagnoses in heterosexual males was 1.5 times that in heterosexual females. Among index cases, men who have sex with men (MSM) were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhoea than heterosexual males (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and deprivation rank, 4 endemic areas were identified including 11,047 diagnoses, 86% of which occurred in London. 33 clusters included 17,629 diagnoses (34% of total diagnoses in 2012 and 2013) and spanned 21 locations, some of which were dominated by heterosexually acquired infection, whilst others were MSM focused. Of the 53,547 diagnoses, 14.5% (7,775) were the result of PN. The proportion of patients who attended services as a result of PN varied from 0% to 61% within different age, gender and sexual orientation cohorts. A third of tests resulting from PN were positive for gonorrhoea. 25% of Local Authorities (n = 81, 95% CI: 20.2, 29.5) had a higher than expected proportion for female PN diagnoses as compared to 16% for males (n = 52, 95% CI: 12.0, 19.9).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The English gonorrhoea epidemic is characterised by spatial-temporal variation.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, and survival signatures are urgently needed to better monitor treatment. MiRNAs displayed vital regulatory roles on target genes, which was necessary involved in the complex disease. We therefore examined the expression levels of miRNAs and genes to identify robust signatures for survival benefit analyses. First, we reconstructed subpathway graphs by embedding miRNA components that were derived from low-throughput miRNA-gene interactions. Then, we randomly divided the data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into training and testing sets, and further formed 100 subsets based on the training set. Using each subset, we identified survival-related miRNAs and genes, and identified survival subpathways based on the reconstructed subpathway graphs. After statistical analyses of these survival subpathways, the most robust subpathways with the top three ranks were identified, and risk scores were calculated based on these robust subpathways for AML patient prognoses. Among these robust subpathways, three representative subpathways, path: 05200_10 from Pathways in cancer, path: 04110_20 from Cell cycle, and path: 04510_8 from Focal adhesion, were significantly associated with patient survival in the TCGA training and testing sets based on subpathway risk scores.

This allows numerous applications. First, ~90% of insertions in essential genes cause a severe loss-of-function phenotype, an effective way to mutagenize genes. Interestingly, 12/14 chromosomes engineered through CRISPR do not carry second-site lethal mutations. Second, 26/36(70%) of lethal insertions tested are rescued with a single &lt;i&gt;UAS-&lt;/i&gt;cDNA construct. Third, loss-of-function phenotypes associated with many &lt;i&gt;GAL4&lt;/i&gt; insertions can be reverted by excision with &lt;i&gt;UAS-flippase&lt;/i&gt;. Fourth, &lt;i&gt;GAL4 &lt;/i&gt;driven&lt;i&gt; UAS-GFP/RFP&lt;/i&gt; reports tissue and cell type specificity of gene expression with high sensitivity.

Activation of the amino acid starvation response (AAR) increases lifespan and acute stress resistance as well as regulates inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of AAR pharmacologically by Halofuginone (HF) significantly inhibits production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and provides protection from intestinal inflammation in mice. HF inhibits IL-1β through general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2)–dependent activation of the cytoprotective integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, resulting in rerouting of IL-1β mRNA from translationally active polysomes to inactive ribocluster complexes—such as stress granules (SGs)—via recruitment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) T cell–restricted intracellular antigen-1(TIA-1)/TIA-1–related (TIAR), which are further cleared through induction of autophagy. GCN2 ablation resulted in reduced autophagy and SG formation, which is inversely correlated with IL-1β production. Furthermore, HF diminishes inflammasome activation through suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which IL-1β is regulated by AAR and further suggests that administration of HF might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AhBKSDqeXkQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1522951034312</recrawled><crawled>1522950975641</crawled><engagementRate>0.14</engagementRate><updated>1522962000000</updated><fingerprint>d1fa6099</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005317</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005317</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Srikanth Battu, Sumbul Afroz, Jeevan Giddaluru, Saima Naz, Weishan Huang, Saratchandra Singh Khumukcham, Rafiq Ahmad Khan, SaleemYousuf Bhat, Insaf Ahmed Qureshi, Bramanandam Manavathi, Aleem Ahmed Khan, Avery August, Seyed Ehtesham Hasnain, Nooruddin Khan&lt;/p&gt;

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1523306525319</recrawled><crawled>1523296582770</crawled><updated>1523307600000</updated><fingerprint>55f062a</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006075</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006075</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schröder, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator of ecosystem functioning but how ecosystem WUE responds to climate change including precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition increases is still unknown. To investigate such responses, an experiment with a randomized block design with water (spring snowfall or summer water addition) and nitrogen addition was conducted in a temperate steppe of northern China. We investigated net ecosystem CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (NEP), gross ecosystem production (GEP) and evapotranspiration (ET) to calculate ecosystem WUE (WUEnep = NEP/ET or WUEgep = GEP/ET) under spring snow and summer water addition with or without N addition from 2011 to 2013. The results showed that spring snow addition only had significant effect on ecosystem WUE in 2013 and summer water addition showed positive effect on ecosystem WUE in 2011 and 2013, as their effects on NEP and GEP is stronger than ET. N addition increased ecosystem WUE in 2012 and 2013 both in spring snow addition and summer water addition for its increasing effects on NEP and GEP but no effect on ET. Summer water addition had less but N addition had greater increasing effects on ecosystem WUE as natural precipitation increase indicating that natural precipitation regulates ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition. Moreover, WUE was tightly related with atmospheric vapor-pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), precipitation and soil moisture indicating the regulation of climate drivers on ecosystem WUE. In addition, it also was affected by aboveground net primary production (ANPP). The study suggests that ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition is determined by the change in carbon process rather than that in water process, which are regulated by climate change in the temperate steppe of northern China.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194198</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>8298f28e</fingerprint><author><name>Xiaolin Zhang</name></author><updated>1520888400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194198</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaolin Zhang, Penghui Zhai, Jianhui Huang, Xiang Zhao, Kuanhu Dong&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, the contents of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were significantly increased by cold treatment. In summary, these results indicate that the metabolome and transcriptome of tartary buckwheat are extensively affected by cold stresses.</description><crawled>1520857339724</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/278432v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1629a5229db:116835:7c9981b6</id><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46964</link><published>1522998000000</published><title>Erratum: Extracellular α-synuclein induces sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 uncoupled from inhibitory G-protein leaving β-arrestin signal intact</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: Extracellular α-synuclein induces sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 uncoupled from inhibitory G-protein leaving β-arrestin signal intact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: Extracellular α-synuclein induces sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 uncoupled from inhibitory G-protein leaving β-arrestin signal intact, Published online: 06 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46964&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/srep46964&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: Extracellular α-synuclein induces sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 uncoupled from inhibitory G-protein leaving β-arrestin signal intact&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/BW4zDQt1wSE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4d758215</fingerprint><author><name>Lifang Zhang</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46964</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46964</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: Extracellular α-synuclein induces sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 uncoupled from inhibitory G-protein leaving β-arrestin signal intact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: Extracellular α-synuclein induces sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 uncoupled from inhibitory G-protein leaving β-arrestin signal intact, Published online: 06 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46964&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/srep46964&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: Extracellular α-synuclein induces sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 uncoupled from inhibitory G-protein leaving β-arrestin signal intact&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/BW4zDQt1wSE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523007498715</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/BW4zDQt1wSE/srep46964</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1627ce6dc86:82285c0:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1522479600000</published><title>Protein structure and function analyses to understand the implication of mutually exclusive splicing [NEW RESULTS]</title><content><content>Alternative splicing (AS) has been suggested as one of the major processes expanding the diversity of proteomes in multicellular organisms.

Elucidation of the neural correlates of time perception constitutes an important research topic in cognitive neuroscience. The focus to date has been on durations in the millisecond to seconds range, but here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine brain functional connectivity during much longer durations (i.e., 15 min). For this purpose, we conducted an initial exploratory experiment followed by a confirmatory experiment. Our results showed that those participants who overestimated time exhibited lower activity of beta (18–30 Hz) at several electrode sites. Furthermore, graph theoretical analysis indicated significant differences in the beta range (15–30 Hz) between those that overestimated and underestimated time. Participants who underestimated time showed higher clustering coefficient compared to those that overestimated time. We discuss our results in terms of two aspects. FFT results, as a linear approach, are discussed within localized/dedicated models (i.e., scalar timing model). Second, non-localized properties of psychological interval timing (as emphasized by intrinsic models) are addressed and discussed based on results derived from graph theory. Results suggested that although beta amplitude in central regions (related to activity of BG-thalamocortical pathway as a dedicated module) is important in relation to timing mechanisms, the properties of functional activity of brain networks; such as the segregation of beta network, are also crucial for time perception. These results may suggest subjective time may be created by vector units instead of scalar ticks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195380</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>ba2774aa</fingerprint><author><name>Amir Hossein Ghaderi</name></author><updated>1523048400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195380</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amir Hossein Ghaderi, Shadi Moradkhani, Arvin Haghighatfard, Fatemeh Akrami, Zahra Khayyer, Fuat Balcı&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Different outcomes among patients hospitalized for bleeding after starting anticoagulation could influence choice of anticoagulant. We compared length of hospitalization, proportion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and 30- and 90-day mortality for adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An US commercial database of 38 million members from 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2014 was used to examine adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin (2,446), dabigatran (442), or rivaroxaban (256). Outcomes included difference in mean total length of hospitalization, proportion of ICU admissions, mean length of ICU stay, and all-cause 30- and 90-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Warfarin users were older and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression modeling with propensity score weighting showed warfarin users were hospitalized 2.0 days longer (95% CI 1.8–2.3; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than dabigatran users and 2.6 days longer (95% CI 2.4–2.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. Dabigatran users were hospitalized 0.6 days longer (95% CI 0.2–1.0; p = 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in the proportion of ICU admissions. Among ICU admissions, warfarin users stayed 3.0 days (95% CI 1.9–3.9; p &amp;lt; 0.001) longer than dabigatran users and 2.4 days longer (95% CI 0.9–3.7; p = 0.003) than rivaroxaban users. There was no difference in ICU stay between dabigatran and rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with shorter hospitalizations; however, there were no differences in 30- and 90-day mortality.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the effects of dopaminergic interventions on pain remains questionable. This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed at exploring the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain evoked by cold stimulation and on spontaneous pain in patients with lumbar radicular (neuropathic) pain.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data was collected from 35 patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (18 men, mean age 56.2±13 years). The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In addition, apomorphine prolonged cold pain tolerance but not threshold in the painful site (from a median of 43.0 seconds (IQR = 63.0) at baseline to 51.0 seconds (IQR = 78.0) at 120 min, p = 0.02). Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195287</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>845996b</fingerprint><author><name>May Haddad</name></author><updated>1522962000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195287</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by May Haddad, Dorit Pud, Roi Treister, Erica Suzan, Elon Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Priming and activating immune stimuli have profound effects on macrophages, however, studies generally evaluate stimuli in isolation rather than in combination. In this study we have investigated the effects of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory stimuli either alone or in combination on macrophage metabolism. These stimuli include host factors such as IFNγ and ovalbumin-immunoglobulin immune complexes, or pathogen factors such as LPS. Untargeted LC-MS based metabolomics provided an in-depth profile of the macrophage metabolome, and revealed specific changes in metabolite abundance upon either individual stimuli or combined stimuli. Here, by factoring in an interaction term in the linear model, we define the metabolome interactome. This approach allowed us to determine whether stimuli interact in a synergistic or antagonistic manner. In conclusion this study demonstrates a robust approach to interrogate immune-metabolism, especially systems that model host-pathogen interactions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194126</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>69e7caf8</fingerprint><author><name>Kevin M.

Members of the &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; genus of mosquitoes are widely recognized as vectors of viral diseases. &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; is its most invasive species, and are known to carry viruses such as Dengue, Chikugunya and Zika. Its emerging importance puts &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; on the forefront of genetic interaction and evolution studies. However, a panel of suitable reference genes specific for this insect is as of now undescribed. Nine reference genes, namely &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;eEF1-γ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;eIF2α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PP2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPL32&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPS17&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PGK1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ILK&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;STK&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated. Expression patterns of the candidate reference genes were observed in a total of seventeen sample types, separated by stage of development and age. Gene stability was inferred from obtained quantification data through three widely cited evaluation algorithms i.e. BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder. No single gene showed a satisfactory degree of stability throughout all developmental stages. Therefore, we propose combinations of &lt;i&gt;PGK&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ILK&lt;/i&gt; for early embryos; &lt;i&gt;RPL32&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RPS17&lt;/i&gt; for late embryos, all four larval instars, and pupae samples; &lt;i&gt;eEF1-γ&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;STK&lt;/i&gt; for adult males; &lt;i&gt;eEF1-γ&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;RPS17&lt;/i&gt; for non-blood fed females; and &lt;i&gt;eEF1-γ&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;eIF2α&lt;/i&gt; for both blood-fed females and cell culture.

Background &lt;p&gt;We have reported that WNT10A plays a critical role in the growth of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells, i.e.; wound healing/scarring. To ascertain the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; regulatory, central functions of WNT10A, we examined the net effects of WNT10A depletion using &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice (&lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We generated &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;mice, displaying a range of unique phenotypes of morpho/organogenetic failure, such as growth retardation, alopecia, kyphosis and infertility, and then focused on the functions of WNT10A in wound healing. We subjected C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) or &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;mice to skin ulcer formation. The &lt;i&gt;WNT10A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;mice had significantly larger injured areas and delayed wound healing, which were associated with (a) a smaller number of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and microvessels; and (b) more reduced expression and synthesis of collagen, compared with WT mice with intact WNT10A expression, especially in those with activated myofibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These observations indicate that WNT10A signaling can play a pivotal in vivo role in wound healing by regulating the expression and synthesis of collagen, as one of fibrogenic factors, at least in part, and critical &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; roles of WNT10A-mediated effective wound healing are extremely closely associated with collagen expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195156</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>66079f8e</fingerprint><author><name>Ke-Yong Wang</name></author><updated>1522357200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195156</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ke-Yong Wang, Sohsuke Yamada, Hiroto Izumi, Manabu Tsukamoto, Tamiji Nakashima, Takashi Tasaki, Xin Guo, Hidetaka Uramoto, Yasuyuki Sasaguri, Kimitoshi Kohno&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The WHO recommends maternity waiting homes (MWH) as one intervention to improve maternal and newborn health. However, persistent structural, cultural and financial barriers in their design and implementation have resulted in mixed success in both their uptake and utilization. Guidance is needed on how to design a MWH intervention that is acceptable and sustainable. Using formative research and guided by a sustainability framework for health programs, we systematically collected data from key stakeholders and potential users in order to design a MWH intervention in Zambia that could overcome multi-dimensional barriers to accessing facility delivery, be acceptable to the community and be financially and operationally sustainable.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We used a concurrent triangulation study design and mixed methods. We used free listing to gather input from a total of 167 randomly sampled women who were pregnant or had a child under the age of two (n = 59), men with a child under the age of two (n = 53), and community elders (n = 55) living in the catchment areas of four rural health facilities in Zambia. We conducted 17 focus group discussions (n = 135) among a purposive sample of pregnant women (n = 33), mothers-in-law (n = 32), traditional birth attendants or community maternal health promoters (n = 38), and men with a child under two (n = 32). We administered 38 semi-structured interviews with key informants who were identified by free list respondents as having a stake in the condition and use of MWHs. Lastly, we projected fixed and variable recurrent costs for operating a MWH.Respondents most frequently mentioned distance, roads, transport, and the quality of MWHs and health facilities as the major problems facing pregnant women in their communities. They also cited inadequate advanced planning for delivery and the lack of access to delivery supplies and baby clothes as other problems. Respondents identified the main problems of MWHs specifically as over-crowding, poor infrastructure, lack of amenities, safety concerns, and cultural issues. To support operational sustainability, community members were willing to participate on oversight committees and contribute labor. The annual fixed recurrent cost per 10-bed MWH was estimated as USD543, though providing food and charcoal added another $3,000USD. Respondents identified water pumps, an agriculture shop, a shop for baby clothes and general goods, and grinding mills as needs in their communities that could potentially be linked with an MWH for financial sustainability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings informed the development of an intervention model for renovating existing MWH or constructing new MWH that meets community standards of safety, comfort and services offered and is aligned with government policies related to facility construction, ownership, and access to health services. The basic strategies of the new MWH model include improving community acceptability, strengthening governance and accountability, and building upon existing efforts to foster financial and operational sustainability. The proposed model addresses the problems cited by our respondents and challenges to MWHs identified by in previous studies and elicits opportunities for social enterprises that could serve the dual purpose of meeting a community need and generating revenue for the MWH.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194535</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>73d28ef6</fingerprint><author><name>Nancy A.

Our understanding on the importance of viral lysis in the functioning of tropical estuarine ecosystem is limited. This study examines viral infection of prokaryotes and subsequent lysis of cells belonging to different morphotypes across a salinity gradient in monsoon driven estuarine ecosystem (Cochin estuary, India). High standing stock of viruses and prokaryotes accompanied by lytic infection rates in the euryhaline/mesohaline region of the estuary suggests salinity to have an influential role in driving interactions between prokaryotes and viruses. High prokaryotic mortality rates, up to 42% of prokaryote population in the pre-monsoon season is further substantiated by a high virus to prokaryote ratio (VPR), suggesting that maintenance of a high number of viruses is dependent on the most active fraction of bacterioplankton. Although myoviruses were the dominant viral morphotype (mean = 43%) throughout the study period, there was significant variation among prokaryotic morphotypes susceptible to viral infection. Among them, the viral infected short rod prokaryote morphotype with lower burst estimates (mean = 18 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was dominant (35%) in the dry seasons whereas a substantial increase in cocci forms (30%) infected by viruses with high burst size (mean = 31 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident during the monsoon season. Such preferential infections of prokaryotic morphopopulations with respect to seasons can have a strong and variable impact on the carbon and energy flow in this tropical ecosystem.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194020</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>85a5d3b8</fingerprint><author><name>Vijayan Jasna</name></author><updated>1520974800000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194020</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vijayan Jasna, Angia Sriram Pradeep Ram, Ammini Parvathi, Telesphore Sime-Ngando&lt;/p&gt;

Jehu, Hiram Cantù, Allen Hill, Caroline Paquette, Julie N. Côté, Julie Nantel&lt;/p&gt;
We aimed to determine the effects of levodopa medication on the performance of a repetitive pointing task while standing, and to investigate the optimal trial duration in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, and older adults. Seventeen individuals with Parkinson’s disease (5 freezers) and 9 older adults stood on force platforms for 30 s and 120 s while performing a bilateral repetitive pointing task, tracked by motion capture. Participants with Parkinson’s disease were assessed on and off medication and older adults were also assessed on separate days. The main findings were that: 1) on medication, participants with Parkinson’s exhibited greater center of pressure root mean square in the medial-lateral direction, greater velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions, and greater range in the medial-lateral direction than off medication; 2) longer trial durations resulted in greater center of pressure range in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and greater coefficient of variation in finger pointing on the least affected side; 3) Parkinson’s participants exhibited larger range in the medial-lateral direction compared to older adults; 4) off medication, freezers presented with less range and root mean square in the anterior-posterior direction than non-freezers; and 5) a correlation emerged between the freezing of gait questionnaire and pointing asymmetry and the coefficient of variation of pointing on the most affected side. Therefore, Parkinson’s medication may increase instability during a repetitive pointing task. Longer trials may provide a better depiction of sway by discriminating between those with and without neurological impairment. Individuals with Parkinson’s were less stable than older adults, supporting that they are at a greater risk for falls. The greater restrictive postural strategy in freezers compared to non-freezers is likely a factor that augments fall-risk. Lastly, the link between freezing of gait and upper-limb movement indicates that freezing may manifest first in the lower-limbs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>15afb55e</fingerprint><author><name>Deborah A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication. Participants were sampled purposefully and taking through in-depth interviews using an interview guide. Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability. Other factors identified to influence non-adherence included polypharmacy practice; tight work schedules; social norms; poor prescription instruction by health providers; and knowledge and experience of medication.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Findings suggests the need for health providers to adopt therapeutic approaches that take into account patients’ beliefs, values and norms in administering medications. Sensitisation of patients and caregivers during admission on the implication of non-adherence, as well as interventions that monitor and provide feedback mechanisms on patients’ medication taking behaviour holds promise for maximising diabetes and hypertensive medication adherence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193995</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>14c67ba6</fingerprint><author><name>Roger A.

Antithyroid drugs are generally selected as the first-line treatment for Graves’ Disease (GD); however, the existence of patients showing resistance or severe side effects to these drugs is an important issue to be solved. The (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] is a multi-functional protein that activates the tissue renin-angiotensin system and is an essential constituent of vacuolar H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase, necessary for the autophagy-lysosome pathway. (P)RR is cleaved to soluble (s)(P)RR, which reflects the status of (P)RR expression. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate whether serum s(P)RR concentration can be used as a biomarker to predict the outcome of antithyroid drug treatment in GD patients. Serum s(P)RR levels were measured in 54 untreated GD patients and 47 control participants. Effects of medical treatment with antithyroid drugs on these levels were investigated in GD patients. Serum s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in patients with Graves’ disease than in control subjects (P&amp;lt;0.005) and were significantly reduced after medical treatment for Graves’ disease. High serum s(P)RR levels were associated with resistance to antithyroid drug treatment, suggesting that serum s(P)RR concentration can be used as a useful biomarker to predict the outcome of antithyroid drug treatment in these patients. Patients with Graves’ disease with low body mass index showed higher levels of serum soluble (pro)renin receptor levels than those with high body mass index. In addition, in patients with Graves’ disease, serum triglyceride levels were negatively correlated with serum soluble (pro)renin receptor levels. All these data indicated an association between low nutrient condition due to hyperthyroidism and increased (pro)renin receptor expression in these patients, suggesting that (pro)renin receptor expression could be increased in the process of stimulating intracellular energy production via activating autophagy function to compensate energy loss.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195464</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>59d0f88f</fingerprint><author><name>Yuki Mizuguchi</name></author><updated>1522962000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195464</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Mizuguchi, Satoshi Morimoto, Shihori Kimura, Noriyoshi Takano, Kaoru Yamashita, Yasufumi Seki, Kanako Bokuda, Midori Yatabe, Junichi Yatabe, Daisuke Watanabe, Takashi Ando, Atsuhiro Ichihara&lt;/p&gt;

Light and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition are among the important environmental factors influencing plant growth and forest regeneration. We used &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt;, a dominant broadleaf tree species native to the deciduous forests of Northern China, to study the combined effects of light exposure and N addition on leaf physiology and individual plant growth. In the greenhouse, we exposed &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt; seedlings to one of two light conditions (8% and 80% of full irradiation) and one of three N treatments (0, 6, and 12 g N m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). After 87 d, we observed that nitrogen deposition had no significant effects on the seedlings regardless of light exposure. In addition, shade significantly reduced plant height, basal diameter, leaf number, total biomass, gas exchange capacity, and carbohydrate content. In contrast, however, shade significantly increased the amount of photosynthetic pigment, above-ground biomass allocation, and specific leaf area. There was also a hierarchical plasticity among the different seedling characteristics. Compared to traits of growth, biomass, biomass allocation and leaf morphology, the leaf physiology, including photosynthetic pigment, gas exchange, carbohydrate, and PUNE, is more sensitive to light conditions. Among the biomass allocation parameters, the leaf and root mass ratios had a relatively low phenotypic plasticity. The seedlings had high foliar physiological plasticity under various light conditions.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the photochemical degradation of trypan blue (TB) and to identify decomposition products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Defined solution samples of TB and a mixture with lutein/zeaxanthin were exposed to blue light. Thermal degradation processes were ruled out using controls not subjected to irradiation. All samples were analyzed using optical microscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Degradation kinetics were determined based on changes in absorbance; intermediates were identified by analyzing mass differences of characteristic fragment ion peaks within the fragmentation patterns, and assignments were verified by NMR.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photochemical degradation, which can be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin. Intermediates vary depending on the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin. The self-sensitized photodegradation of TB occurs under generation of dimethyl sulfate and presumed formation of phenol. In contrast, within the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin the decomposition of TB indicates the formation of methoxyamine and sulfonyl arin. Thermal degradation processes were not observed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photodegradation that may be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin and results in the formation of cytotoxic decomposition products.

Our findings contribute to understand degradation mechanisms of TB and may elucidate previous clinical and experimental observations of cellular toxicity after TB application.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195849</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16266f2b14f:605c2a3:34f43e70</id><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><published>1522134000000</published><title>Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03793-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ramin Skibba explores a history of unresolved questions beyond the Copenhagen interpretation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5a608048</fingerprint><author><name>Ramin Skibba</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einstein, Bohr and the war over quantum theory, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03793-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ramin Skibba explores a history of unresolved questions beyond the Copenhagen interpretation.</description><crawled>1522145603919</crawled><engagement>225</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03793-2/d41586-018-03793-2_15559644.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f55:34f43e70</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195095</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Hippocampal protein kinase D1 is necessary for DHPG-induced learning and memory impairments in rats</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wang, Florian Duclot, Bradley R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of learning and memory impairments remains a challenge. Recent investigations have shown that the activation of group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) in cultured hippocampal neurons by application of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) causes the regulated internalization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which subsequently activates protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Through phosphorylating the C-terminals of the NMDAR GluN2 subunits, PKD1 down-regulates the activity of remaining (non-internalized) surface NMDARs. The knockdown of PKD1 does not affect the DHPG-induced inhibition of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) but prevents the DHPG-induced inhibition of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, we investigated the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effects of bilateral infusions of DHPG into the hippocampal CA1 area of rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object discrimination (NOD) tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 300 adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250–280 g) were used for behavioral tests. One hundred ninety four were used in MWM test and the other 106 rats in the NOD test. Following one week of habituation to the vivarium, rats were bilaterally implanted under deep anesthesia with cannulas aimed at the CA1 area of the hippocampus (CA1 coordinates in mm from Bregma: AP -3.14; lateral +/-2; DV -3.0). Through implanted cannulas artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), the group1 mGluR antagonist 6-Methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, or the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673 were infused into the bilateral hippocampal CA1 areas (2 μL per side, over 5 min). The effects of these infusions and the effects of PKD1 knockdown were examined in MWM or NOD test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;DHPG infusion increased the latency to reach the platform in the MWM test and reduced the preference for the novel object in the NOD task. We found that the DHPG effects were dose-dependent and could be maintained for up to 2 days. Notably, these effects could be prevented by pre-infusion of the group1 mGluR antagonist MPEP, the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673, or by PKD1 knockdown in the hippocampal CA1 area.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Altogether, these findings provide direct evidence that PKD1-mediated signaling may play a critical role in the induction of learning and memory impairments by DHPG infusion into the hippocampal CA1 area.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>6755c000</fingerprint><author><name>Wei Wang</name></author><updated>1522789200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195095</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wang, Florian Duclot, Bradley R.

We conducted a document analysis that explored publication ethics and authorship in the context of population biobanks from both a theoretical (e.g. normative documents) and practical (e.g. biobank-specific documentation) perspective. The aim was to provide an overview of the state of authorship attribution in population biobanks and attempt to fill the gap in discussions around the issue. Our findings demonstrate that the most common approach adopted in both the normative and biobank-specific documentation is acknowledgment. A co-authorship approach was second and highlighted concerns surrounding the fairness of imposing authorship of the scientific leadership as a condition to access data and biosamples, as well as the alignment with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ criteria such as what is deemed a significant contribution and how to ensure accountability. Based on these findings, we propose a three-prong approach, that may be cumulative, to address the issue of authorship attribution in the context of population biobanks, namely 1) the biobank should be appropriately acknowledged; 2) an invitation for co-authorship should be made based on the spirit of collaboration and provided a substantial contribution has been made; and 3) a citation/referencing option should be available.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194997</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>6520608</fingerprint><author><name>Erika Kleiderman</name></author><updated>1521838800000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194997</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erika Kleiderman, Amy Pack, Pascal Borry, Ma’n Zawati&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Body Mass Index (BMI), like most human phenotypes, is substantially heritable. However, BMI is not normally distributed; the skew appears to be structural, and increases as a function of age. Moreover, twin correlations for BMI commonly violate the assumptions of the most common variety of the classical twin model, with the MZ twin correlation greater than twice the DZ correlation. This study aimed to decompose twin correlations for BMI using more general skew-t distributions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Same sex MZ and DZ twin pairs (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 7,086) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry were included. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to decompose twin correlations for BMI into multiple mixture distributions. LPA was performed using the default normal mixture distribution and the skew-t mixture distribution. Similar analyses were performed for height as a comparison. Our analyses are then replicated in an independent dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A two-class solution under the skew-t mixture distribution fits the BMI distribution for both genders. The first class consists of a relatively normally distributed, highly heritable BMI with a mean in the normal range. The second class is a positively skewed BMI in the overweight and obese range, with lower twin correlations. In contrast, height is normally distributed, highly heritable, and is well-fit by a single latent class. Results in the replication dataset were highly similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that two distinct processes underlie the skew of the BMI distribution. The contrast between height and weight is in accord with subjective psychological experience: both are under obvious genetic influence, but BMI is also subject to behavioral control, whereas height is not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194968</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>c59c7c25</fingerprint><author><name>Siny Tsang</name></author><updated>1522270800000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194968</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siny Tsang, Glen E.

Wind has a significant effect on the control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), resulting in changes in their ground speed and direction, which has an important influence on the results of integrated optimization of UAV task allocation and path planning. The objective of this integrated optimization problem changes from minimizing flight distance to minimizing flight time. In this study, the Euclidean distance between any two targets is expanded to the Dubins path length, considering the minimum turning radius of fixed-wing UAVs. According to the vector relationship between wind speed, UAV airspeed, and UAV ground speed, a method is proposed to calculate the flight time of UAV between targets. On this basis, a variable-speed Dubins path vehicle routing problem (VS-DP-VRP) model is established with the purpose of minimizing the time required for UAVs to visit all the targets and return to the starting point. By designing a crossover operator and mutation operator, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, the results of which show that an effective UAV task allocation and path planning solution under steady wind can be provided.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>5e6e4f2a</fingerprint><author><name>He Luo</name></author><updated>1521666000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by He Luo, Zhengzheng Liang, Moning Zhu, Xiaoxuan Hu, Guoqiang Wang&lt;/p&gt;

By designing a crossover operator and mutation operator, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, the results of which show that an effective UAV task allocation and path planning solution under steady wind can be provided.</description><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162aef7f1ab:1bf4339:9aea0a7d</id><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04257-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parenting methods of elusive caecilians are described.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a73657d8</fingerprint><crawled>1523353907627</crawled><engagementRate>0.96</engagementRate><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04257-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parenting methods of elusive caecilians are described.</description><published>1523343600000</published><engagement>45</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04257-3/d41586-018-04257-3_15593274.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_1628d23c837:5644e:a077e55f</id><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00241/20180403/images/medium/bi-2018-00241f_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00241&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Heavy burden of child injuries and lack of policy response in Ethiopia call for an improved understanding of the situation and development of action plans from multiple governmental agencies and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A consortium of international and Ethiopian researchers and stakeholders used extensive literature review and mixed analytical methods to estimate and project the burden of fatal and non-fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2030. Estimates were derived for children aged 0–14 years. Data sources include a longitudinal study conducted by the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia and the World Bank as well as model-based estimates from World Health Organization 2017 and Global Burden of Disease 2016 project.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Injuries caused about 25 thousand deaths among 0-14-year olds in Ethiopia in 2015. The leading cause of fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia was road-traffic injuries, followed by fire, heat and hot substances and drowning. The death rate due to injuries among 0–14 years olds was about 50 percent higher in males than females. Rural children were exposed to a greater risk of injury than their urban peers. The longitudinal survey suggests that the incidence rate of child injuries increased during the period 2011–2014. The annual mortality caused by injuries is projected to increase from 10,697 in 2015 to 11,279 in 2020 and 11,989 in 2030 among children under 5 years, an increase of 12 percentage points in 15 years. The number of deaths among 0-14-year olds will be 26,463, 27,807, and 30,364 respectively in 2015, 2020, and 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;As the first multisectoral collaboration on child injuries in Ethiopia, this study identified gaps in understanding of the burden of child injuries in Ethiopia. In consultation with Ethiopian government and other stakeholders, we propose starting an injury surveillance system at health clinics and hospitals and building an intervention package based on existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194692</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>6d69379</fingerprint><author><name>Qingfeng Li</name></author><updated>1522184400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194692</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qingfeng Li, Olakunle Alonge, Collene Lawhorn, Yirga Ambaw, Smita Kumar, Troy Jacobs, Adnan A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) refers to a cluster of metabolic disturbances which is associated with increased risk for vascular and degenerative conditions in general population. Although the relationship between vascular risk factors and dementia is undisputable, additional hazard for cognitive decline in older population with concurrent metabolic disorders still waits to be demonstrated. The present review aims to analyze data on MetS and risk for cognitive decline in elderly persons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Database searches were performed in Medline, ISI and PsycINFO for articles assessing cognitive performances of older subjects with MetS.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of a total of 505 studies, 25 were selected for the review. Risk of selection biases was identified in all the studies. Although all articles followed recognized diagnostic recommendations for MetS, minor criteria modifications were detected in most of them. Hyperglycemia was consistently associated with impaired cognitive performances in older individuals, but the role of MetS for cognitive decline and for the onset of dementia showed heterogeneous results.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Current available data in the literature concerning the impact of MetS on the cognition of older population is inconclusive and based on inconsistent evidence.

&lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt; possesses powerful antifungal activity, as demonstrated in many studies. In this study, the antifungal spectrum of &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt; alcohol extract was determined, and the resulting EC50 values (mg/mL) of its extract on eleven fungi, including &lt;i&gt;Fusarium graminearum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fusarium chlamydosporum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Alternaria alternate&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fusarium tricinctum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sclerotinia sclerotiorum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Botrytis cinerea&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fusarium culmorum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rhizopus oryzae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cladosporium cladosporioides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum higginsianum&lt;/i&gt;, were 0.1088, 0.1742, 0.1888, 0.2547, 0.3135, 0.3825, 0.4229, 1.2086, 4.5176, 3.8833 and 5.0183, respectively. Among them, &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; was selected to determine the inhibitory effects of the compounds (including curdione, isocurcumenol, curcumenol, curzerene, β-elemene, curcumin, germacrone and curcumol) derived from &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, the antifungal activities of curdione, curcumenol, curzerene, curcumol and isocurcumenol and the synergies of the complexes of curdione and seven other chemicals were investigated. Differential proteomics of &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; was also compared, and at least 2021 reproducible protein spots were identified. Among these spots, 46 were classified as differentially expressed proteins, and these proteins are involved in energy metabolism, tRNA synthesis and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, several fungal physiological differences were also analysed. The antifungal effect included fungal cell membrane disruption and inhibition of ergosterol synthesis, respiration, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and NADH oxidase.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194284</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>64ce5708</fingerprint><author><name>Ciqiong Chen</name></author><updated>1521147600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194284</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ciqiong Chen, Li Long, Fusheng Zhang, Qin Chen, Cheng Chen, Xiaorui Yu, Qingya Liu, Jinku Bao, Zhangfu Long&lt;/p&gt;

Differential proteomics of &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; was also compared, and at least 2021 reproducible protein spots were identified. Among these spots, 46 were classified as differentially expressed proteins, and these proteins are involved in energy metabolism, tRNA synthesis and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, several fungal physiological differences were also analysed. The antifungal effect included fungal cell membrane disruption and inhibition of ergosterol synthesis, respiration, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and NADH oxidase.</description><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194284</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1622b3efac9:d25267:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><published>1521097200000</published><title>Drug executives should take a Hippocratic oath</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drug executives should take a Hippocratic oath&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug executives should take a Hippocratic oath, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03230-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03230-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The industry must earn patients’ trust that new medicines really are worth the price, says Bob More.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c5be9036</fingerprint><author><name>Bob More</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03230-4</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03230-4</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drug executives should take a Hippocratic oath&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug executives should take a Hippocratic oath, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03230-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03230-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The industry must earn patients’ trust that new medicines really are worth the price, says Bob More.</description><crawled>1521143970505</crawled><engagement>39</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03230-4/d41586-018-03230-4_15532938.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03230-4</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ecc:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>MiR-29b affects the secretion of PROG and promotes the proliferation of bovine corpus luteum cells</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ming-Qiang Xu, Hao Jiang, Li-Qun Zhang, Xu-Lei Sun, Dan Luo, Yao Fu, Yan Gao, Bao Yuan, Jia-Bao Zhang&lt;/p&gt;
The regulatory role of miRNAs has been explored in ovarian cells, and their effects on gonadal development, apoptosis, ovulation, steroid production and corpus luteum (CL) development have been revealed. In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-29b at different stages of bovine CL development and predicted the target genes of miR-29b. We confirmed that miR-29b reduces the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), affects progesterone (PROG) secretion and regulates the function of the CL. RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b was significantly higher in functional CL phases than in the regressed CL phase. Immunohistochemistry showed that OXTR was expressed in both large and small CL cells and was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of these cells. We analyzed the expression levels of OXTR and found that transfection with a miR-29b mimic decreased OXTR expression, but transfection with the inhibitor had a limited effect on the expression of the OXTR protein. At the same time, the secretion of PROG was significantly increased in the miR-29b mimic-transfected group. We also analyzed the effect of miR-29b on the apoptosis of CL cells. Finally, we found that miR-29b could promote the proliferation of bovine CL cells. In conclusion, we found that miR-29b reduces the expression of OXTR and can promote PROG secretion and the proliferation of CL cells via OXTR.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>b880d74f</fingerprint><author><name>Ming-Qiang Xu</name></author><updated>1522875600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ming-Qiang Xu, Hao Jiang, Li-Qun Zhang, Xu-Lei Sun, Dan Luo, Yao Fu, Yan Gao, Bao Yuan, Jia-Bao Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about 11% of Tuberculosis (TB) cases occur in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and it is the leading cause of death in this population. An important step towards reducing the incidence and mortality of TB in PLHIV is to reduce the time from onset of symptoms to treatment. Factors related to TB treatment delay therefore need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with TB at the National Institute of Infectious Disease, at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil we conducted a survival analysis to identify factors associated with patient and health care treatment delay. In our analysis we included patients who were co-infected with TB and HIV (n = 201). Patients were followed during the course of their TB treatment and information regarding duration of symptoms, sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were collected at the baseline visit.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median time from onset of initial symptoms to prescription of TB treatment (total delay) was 82 days. From initiation of symptoms to first visit at INI clinic (patient delay), the median was 51 days. From first visit to initiation of treatment (health care delay) the median was 16 days. Illiteracy was associated with greater patient delay [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.25, CI 95% 1.29–3.94]. Having had a previous episode of TB (HR = 0.53, CI 95% 0.37–0.74) and being married (HR = 0.71, CI 95% 0.54–0.94) were inversely related to patient delay. Illiteracy was also associated with greater health care delay (HR = 2.83, CI 95% 1.25–5.47) in contrast to high viral load (HR = 0.37, CI 95% 0.24–0.54) and weight loss greater than 10% (HR = 0.54, CI 95% 0.37–0.8), both of which were inversely related to health care delay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study highlights the existence of factors that lead to greater risk of delayed treatment of TB among patients co-infected with HIV and TB. These include factors that can be assessed through targeted interventions which have implications for improving treatment outcomes and, through reduced duration of infectiousness, reduce the incidence of TB in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195409</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>1d85d779</fingerprint><author><name>Betânia M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Antenatal depression is associated with adverse maternal and infant well-being. However, compared to postpartum depression, it has been less frequently explored globally or in Jamaica. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, antenatal depressive symptoms among Jamaican women in order to inform policy and build interventions that could improve their management and reduce their negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This secondary analysis of data from the second Jamaican Birth Cohort Study (JA-Kids Birth Cohort) included 3,517 women enrolled during pregnancy. Information was extracted from interviewer-administered questionnaires which recorded social, demographic, medical and obstetric information during pregnancy. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) was used to screen for depression, with scores ≥13 considered indicative of a high likelihood of depression. Bivariate analysis examined associations between depressive symptoms and: age, income, financial difficulties, perceived social support, perceived partner infidelity, previous child-bearing unions and children with the current partner. Obstetric factors were also explored and included gravidity, prior adverse pregnancy outcome and complications from previous pregnancies. Variables that predicted the likelihood of depression based on an EPDS cut score of 13 were evaluated using logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One in five participants (19.6%; 95% CI 18.3–20.9%) had a high likelihood of antenatal depression (EPDS ≥13). Significant predictors of high depressive symptom severity included four indicators of poor perceived social and partner support [ORs (95% CI) ranged from: 1.61 (1.07–2.43); p = 0.024 to 3.14(1.69–5.84); p&amp;lt; 0.001], perceived partner infidelity [1.86 (1.36, 2.54); p&amp;lt;0.001], exposure to violence [2.36 (1.66–3.38); p&amp;lt;0.001] and financial difficulties [1.39 (1.07, 1.80); p = 0.013].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Women’s perceived social and partner support were strongly associated with depressive symptom severity. Within the Jamaican cultural context of unstable reproductive unions, efforts are needed to involve fathers in the antenatal care process to strategically improve the psychological well-being of new mothers which may positively influence long term developmental outcomes for their babies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194338</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>9a39ecbf</fingerprint><author><name>Omotayo Bernard</name></author><updated>1521493200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194338</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Omotayo Bernard, Roger C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Trauma is a global burden of disease and one of the main causes of death worldwide. Therefore, many countries around the world have implemented a wide range of different initiatives to minimize mortality rates after trauma. One of these initiatives is the bundling of treatment expertise in trauma centers and the establishment of trauma networks.Germany has a decentralized system of trauma care medical centers. Severely injured patients ought to receive adequate treatment in both level I and level II centers. This study investigated the effectiveness of a decentralized network and the question whether level I and level II centers have comparable patient outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;In 2009, the first trauma network DGU&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; in Germany was certified in the rural area of Eastern Bavaria. All patients admitted to the 25 participating hospitals were prospectively included in this network in the framework of a study sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research between March 2012 and February 2014. 2 hospitals were level I centers (maximal care centers), 8 hospitals were level II centers, and 15 hospitals were level III centers. The criterion for study inclusion was an injury severity score (ISS) ≥ 16 for patients´ primarily admitted to a level I or a level II center. Exclusion criteria were transferal to another hospital within 48 h, an unknown revised injury severity classification II score (RISC II), or primary admittance to a level III center (n = 52). 875 patients were included in the study.Univariate analyses were used regarding the preclinical and clinical parameters, the primary endpoint mortality rate, and the secondary endpoints length of stay, organ failure, and neurological outcome (GOS). The primary endpoint was additionally evaluated by means of multivariable analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Indices for injury severity (GCS, AIS&lt;sub&gt;Head&lt;/sub&gt;, ISS, and NISS) as well as the predicted probability of death (RISC II) were higher in level I centers than in level II centers.No significant differences were found between the mortality rate of the unadjusted analysis [level I: 21.6% (CI: 16.5, 27.9), level II: 18.1% (CI: 14.4, 22.5), p = 0.28] and that of the adjusted analysis [level I SMR: 0.94 (CI: 0.72, 1.21), level II SMR: 1.18 (CI 0.95, 1.48) SMR: expected vs. calculated mortality rate according to RISC II]. Multivariable analysis showed a survival advantage of patients admitted to a level I center with a probability of death of 13% (RISC II). The number need to treat was 10 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that a rural trauma network with centralized and local structures may achieve equivalent results with regard to mortality rates to those obtained in level I and level II centers. These results were furthered by a certain preclinical centralization (24/7 air rescue) of patients. The study also showed a survival advantage of patients admitted to a level I center with a probability of death of 13%.

Terrestrial plants can harbor endophytic fungi that may induce changes in plant physiology that in turn affect interactions with herbivorous insects. We evaluated whether the application of entomopathogenic fungi &lt;i&gt;Beauveria bassiana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium brunneum&lt;/i&gt; to soybean seeds could become endophytic and affect interactions with soybean aphid (&lt;i&gt;Aphis glycines&lt;/i&gt; Matsumura). It was found that &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glycines&lt;/i&gt; population sizes increased on plants with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brunneum&lt;/i&gt; (strain F52) seed inoculum, but no significant effects were shown with analogous treatments with &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; (strain GHA). Fungi recovered from soybean plant tissues indicate that endophytism was established, and that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; was more prevalent. &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium brunneum&lt;/i&gt; was only recovered from stems, but &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; was recovered from stems and leaves. This work confirms that some entomopathogenic fungi can be endophytic in soybean, however, some of these fungi may have a negative effect on the plants by increasing susceptibility of soybean to &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glycines&lt;/i&gt;. We also used DNA sequence data to identify species of &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium&lt;/i&gt; obtained from agricultural fields in Iowa.

Of 56 patients with upper tract urothelial cancer, 75% tested positive by UroSEEK, including 79% of those with non-invasive tumors. UroSEEK detected genetic abnormalities in 68% of urines obtained from BC patients under surveillance who demonstrated clinical evidence of recurrence. The advantages of UroSEEK over cytology were evident in low-grade BCs; UroSEEK detected 67% of cases whereas cytology detected none. These results establish the foundation for a new non-invasive approach for detection of urothelial cancer.</description><crawled>1521550259672</crawled><engagement>8</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32143</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1621f70f2c7:43866a:34f43e70</id><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>The rodent olfactory bulb incorporates thousands of newly generated inhibitory neurons daily throughout adulthood, but the role of adult neurogenesis in olfactory processing is not fully understood.

Fungal spores and mycelium fragments are particles which become and remain airborne and have been subjects of aerobiological studies. The presence and the abundance of taxa in aerobiological samples can be very variable and impaired by changeable climatic conditions. Because many fungi produce mycotoxins and both their mycelium fragments and spores are potential allergens, monitoring the presence of these taxa is of key importance. So far data on exposure and sensitization to fungal allergens are mainly based on the assessment of few, easily identifiable taxa and focused only on certain environments. The microscopic method used to analyze aerobiological samples and the inconspicuous fungal characters do not allow a in depth taxonomical identification. Here, we present a first assessment of fungal diversity from airborne samples using a DNA metabarcoding analysis. The nuclear ITS2 region was selected as barcode to catch fungal diversity in mixed airborne samples gathered during two weeks in four sites of North-Eastern and Central Italy. We assessed the taxonomic composition and diversity within and among the sampled sites and compared the molecular data with those obtained by traditional microscopy.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is the transformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promote tumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motile tumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeleton regulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling of unbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2 (mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underlies tumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whether CAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media (CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly and robustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammary fibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAF cell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine array analysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative to control WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2 protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195278</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>8ed0de76</fingerprint><author><name>Kaitlyn M.

This diversity has shown two faces: the expression dynamics (gene to gene variability) can be quantified more accurately, thanks to the measurement of lowly-expressed genes. Second, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same gene at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent and to provide a summarized view of single-cell expression data. PCA is one of the most powerful framework to provide a suitable representation of high dimensional datasets, by searching for new axis catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical PCA is based on Euclidean distances and projections that work poorly in presence of over-dispersed counts that show zero-inflation. We propose a probabilistic Count Matrix Factorization (pCMF) approach for single-cell expression data analysis, that relies on a sparse Gamma-Poisson factor model.

This diversity has shown two faces: the expression dynamics (gene to gene variability) can be quantified more accurately, thanks to the measurement of lowly-expressed genes. Second, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same gene at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent and to provide a summarized view of single-cell expression data. PCA is one of the most powerful framework to provide a suitable representation of high dimensional datasets, by searching for new axis catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical PCA is based on Euclidean distances and projections that work poorly in presence of over-dispersed counts that show zero-inflation. We propose a probabilistic Count Matrix Factorization (pCMF) approach for single-cell expression data analysis, that relies on a sparse Gamma-Poisson factor model. This hierarchical model is inferred using a variational EM algorithm. We show how this probabilistic framework induces a geometry that is suitable for single-cell data, and produces a compression of the data that is very powerful for clustering purposes. Our method is competed to other standard representation methods like t-SNE, and we illustrate its performance for the representation of single-cell data.

Recent data suggest the existence of a complement alternative pathway activation in the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a condition that remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively).

Shane Pankratz, Kelly Chong, Matthew Sandoval, Maria-Eleni Roumelioti, Mark Unruh&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. Controversies still exist over the relationship between hyponatremia and outcomes of hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To analyze the association of low serum sodium levels at hospital admission with in-hospital mortality and patient disposition and to compare the distribution of the risk of death associated with hyponatremia across the lifespan of hospitalized patients, we conducted an observational study of 2.3 million patients using data extracted from the Cerner Health Facts database between 2000 and 2014. Logistic regression models were used in the analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At hospital admission 14.4% of hospitalized patients had serum sodium levels [Na] &amp;lt;135 mEq/L. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, we found that the risk of in-hospital mortality significantly increases for [Na] levels &amp;lt; 135 or ≥143 to ≤145 mEq/L compared to the reference interval of 140 to &amp;lt;143 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001). We observed similar trends for the relationship between [Na] levels and discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility. We demonstrated that younger age groups (18 to &amp;lt;45, 45 to &amp;lt;65) had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to older age groups (65 to &amp;lt;75, ≥75) for [Na] levels &amp;lt;130 mEq/L or 143 to ≤145 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is common among hospitalized patients and is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. Controversies still exist over the relationship between hyponatremia and outcomes of hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To analyze the association of low serum sodium levels at hospital admission with in-hospital mortality and patient disposition and to compare the distribution of the risk of death associated with hyponatremia across the lifespan of hospitalized patients, we conducted an observational study of 2.3 million patients using data extracted from the Cerner Health Facts database between 2000 and 2014. Logistic regression models were used in the analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At hospital admission 14.4% of hospitalized patients had serum sodium levels [Na] &amp;lt;135 mEq/L. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, we found that the risk of in-hospital mortality significantly increases for [Na] levels &amp;lt; 135 or ≥143 to ≤145 mEq/L compared to the reference interval of 140 to &amp;lt;143 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001).

Douchi has been consumed as a flavoring ingredient for centuries. During production of douchi, numerous microorganisms play important roles in the hydrolysis and conversion of proteins and starch, which are related to the quality and flavor of the end product. Therefore, in the present study, the microbial diversity in two types of home-made traditional bacterial douchi from Gansu province in northwest China was studied by high-throughput sequencing, and a corresponding analysis of the bacterial and fungal communities were conducted. The results showed that geography may have impacted the fungal diversity and the bacterial and fungal species richness in the samples. The results also showed that the microbial community was significantly different in samples of different origin and the difference in the microbial community at the genus level was greater than at phylum level. Two dominant bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ignatzschineria&lt;/i&gt;) were common to the two samples, both of which had a relative abundance of more than 1%. Four bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aerococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Jeotgalicoccus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Qingyang, while another four (&lt;i&gt;Carnobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aneurinibacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Longnan. Two dominant fungal genera (&lt;i&gt;Pichia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;) were shared by the two samples. Additionally, two genera (&lt;i&gt;Rhodosporidium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Yarrowia&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in samples from Longnan. The functional genes of the bacteria present in samples indicated that a significant difference was observed in the bacterial community between samples of different origin. We also found that microbial interactions between bacterial and fungal communities in the samples were very complex.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the number of studies that have tried to demonstrate that there is an association between previous falls and the fear of falling, the relationship between these two variables remains a matter of controversy.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our objective was to investigate whether the fear of falling is a cause of falls, a consequence, or both in community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive, longitudinal, prospective study was performed. A total of 640 individuals were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. Sociodemographic data, health status, history of falls and fear of falling were assessed at baseline and at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of falls at baseline was 25% as opposed to 35.2% at 24 months. The prevalence of the fear of falling was 41.5% at baseline. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between a history of falls and the fear of falling. Other factors associated with the fear of falling were female gender, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability. In total, 41.7% of the subjects who had reported a fear of falling at baseline had suffered at least one fall 24 months later. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the fear of falling was a risk factor for falls. According to the final model adjusted for other covariates, the only reliable predictor was female gender. The Cox model stratified by gender failed to show a crude association between fear of falling and falls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A previous history of falls in the previous year was a good predictor of the fear of falling; but the fear of falling was a predictor of falls during follow-up only in the unadjusted model, pointing to strong gender turns out as an effect modifier of the association of FOF and subsequent falls.

A dominant mechanism in the Judgment and Decision Making literature states that information is accumulated about each choice option until a decision threshold is met. Only after that threshold does a subject start to execute a motor response to indicate their choice. However, recent research has revealed spatial gradients in motor responses as a function of comparison difficulty as well as changes-of-mind in the middle of an action, both suggesting continued accumulation and processing of decision-related signals after the decision boundary. Here we present a formal model and supporting data from a number comparison task that a continuous motor planner, combined with a simple statistical inference scheme, can model detailed behavioral effects without assuming a threshold. This threshold-free model reproduces subjects’ sensitivity to numerical distance in reaching, accuracy, reaction time, and changes of mind. We argue that the motor system positions the effectors using an optimal biomechanical feedback controller, and continuous statistical inference on outputs from cognitive processes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195188</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>5f69c1c2</fingerprint><author><name>Santiago Alonso-Diaz</name></author><updated>1522962000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195188</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Santiago Alonso-Diaz, Jessica F.

The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC provides an efficient platform for profiling DNA methylation in humans at over 850,000 CpGs. Model organisms such as mice do not currently benefit from an equivalent array. Here we used this array to measure DNA methylation in mice. We defined probes targeting conserved regions and performed differential methylation analysis and compared between the array-based assay and affinity-based DNA sequencing of methyl-CpGs (MBD-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Mouse samples consisted of 11 liver DNA from two strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), that varied widely in age. Linear regression was applied to detect differential methylation. In total, 13,665 probes (1.6% of total probes) aligned to conserved CpGs. Beta-values (β-value) for these probes showed a distribution similar to that in humans. Overall, there was high concordance in methylation signal between the EPIC array and MBD-seq (Pearson correlation r = 0.70, p-value &amp;lt; 0.0001). However, the EPIC probes had higher quantitative sensitivity at CpGs that are hypo- (β-value &amp;lt; 0.3) or hypermethylated (β-value &gt; 0.7). In terms of differential methylation, no EPIC probe detected a significant difference between age groups at a Benjamini-Hochberg threshold of 10%, and the MBD-seq performed better at detecting age-dependent change in methylation. However, the top most significant probe for age (cg13269407; uncorrected p-value = 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) is part of the clock CpGs used to estimate the human epigenetic age. For strain, 219 EPIC probes detected significant differential methylation (FDR cutoff 10%) with ~80% CpGs associated with higher methylation in D2. This higher methylation profile in D2 compared to B6 was also replicated by the MBD-seq data. To summarize, we found only a small subset of EPIC probes that target conserved sites. However, for this small subset the array provides a reliable assay of DNA methylation and can be effectively used to measure differential methylation in mice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193496</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>4bd5067b</fingerprint><author><name>Hemant Gujar</name></author><updated>1520888400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193496</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hemant Gujar, Jane W.

The presence of low-frequency variants with few mutations with respect to major strains may result in an immune escape, emergence of drug resistance, and an increase of virulence and infectivity. Next-generation sequencing technologies permit detection of sample intra-host viral population at extremely great depth, thus providing an opportunity to access low-frequency variants. Long read lengths offered by single-molecule sequencing technologies allow all viral variants to be sequenced in a single pass. However, high sequencing error rates limit the ability to study heterogeneous viral populations composed of rare, closely related variants. In this article, we present CliqueSNV, a novel reference-based method for reconstruction of viral variants from NGS data. It efficiently constructs an allele graph based on linkage between single nucleotide variations and identifies true viral variants by merging cliques of that graph using combinatorial optimization techniques. The new method outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and running time on experimental and simulated NGS data for titrated levels of known viral variants. For PacBio reads, it accurately reconstructs variants with frequency as low as 0.1%. For Illumina reads, it fully reconstructs main variants.

Background &lt;p&gt;To examine the accuracy of Rapid Diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;Talaromyces marneffei&lt;/i&gt; (RDTM) in order to improve diagnosis and treatment for clinical measures and reduce the mortality due to associated infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we screened PubMed, Ovid (Cochrane library) and Web of Science, Chinese database CNKI and Wanfang for articles published between 1956 and December, 2017. Data were taken from cross-sectional studies as well as from baseline measurements in longitudinal studies with clinical follow-up. Articles were excluded if they did not contain a cohort with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; and a control cohort or a cohort with standard fungus culture. Data were extracted by two authors and checked by three for accuracy.

The total combined sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnosis of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68–0.90) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98–1.00). According to the experimental method, the included studies can be divided into three subgroups, including PCR-based, ELISA-based and others.

&lt;i&gt;Epipremnum aureum&lt;/i&gt; is an important foliage plant in the Araceae family. In this study, we have sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureum&lt;/i&gt; by using Illumina Hiseq sequencing platforms. This genome is a double-stranded circular DNA sequence of 164,831 bp that contains 35.8% GC. The two inverted repeats (IRa and IRb; 26,606 bp) are spaced by a small single-copy region (22,868 bp) and a large single-copy region (88,751 bp). The chloroplast genome has 131 (113 unique) functional genes, including 86 (79 unique) protein-coding genes, 37 (30 unique) tRNA genes, and eight (four unique) rRNA genes. Tandem repeats comprise the majority of the 43 long repetitive sequences. In addition, 111 simple sequence repeats are present, with mononucleotides being the most common type and di- and tetranucleotides being infrequent events. Positive selection pressure on &lt;i&gt;rps12&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureum&lt;/i&gt; chloroplast has been demonstrated via synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates and selection pressure sites analyses. &lt;i&gt;Ycf15&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;infA&lt;/i&gt; are pseudogenes in this species.

Polyploidization has played an important role in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly at the base of Teleostei–an enormously successful ray-finned fish group with additional genome doublings on lower taxonomic levels. The investigation of post-polyploid genome dynamics might provide important clues about the evolution and ecology of respective species and can help to decipher the role of polyploidy &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on speciation. Few studies have attempted to investigate the dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences in the post-polyploid genome using molecular cytogenetic tools in fishes, though recent efforts demonstrated their usefulness. The demonstrably monophyletic freshwater loach family Botiidae, branching to evolutionary diploid and tetraploid lineages separated &gt;25 Mya, offers a suited model group for comparing the long-term repetitive DNA evolution. For this, we integrated phylogenetic analyses with cytogenetical survey involving Giemsa- and Chromomycin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/DAPI stainings and fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization with 5S/45S rDNA, U2 snDNA and telomeric probes in representative sample of 12 botiid species.
The karyotypes of all diploids were composed of 2n = 50 chromosomes, while majority of tetraploids had 2n = 4x = 100, with only subtle interspecific karyotype differences. The exceptional karyotype of &lt;i&gt;Botia dario&lt;/i&gt; (2n = 4x = 96) suggested centric fusions behind the 2n reduction. Variable patterns of FISH signals revealed cases of intraspecific polymorphisms, rDNA amplification, variable degree of correspondence with CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and almost no phylogenetic signal. In tetraploids, either additivity or loci gain/loss was recorded. Despite absence of classical interstitial telomeric sites, large blocks of interspersed rDNA/telomeric regions were found in diploids only.
We uncovered different molecular drives of studied repetitive DNA classes within botiid genomes as well as the advanced stage of the re-diploidization process in tetraploids.

Investigation of human diet during the Neolithic has often been limited to a few archaeological cultures or single sites. In order to provide insight into the development of human food consumption and husbandry strategies, our study explores bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 466 human and 105 faunal individuals from 26 sites in central Germany. It is the most extensive data set to date from an enclosed geographic microregion, covering 4,000 years of agricultural history from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The animal data show that a variety of pastures and dietary resources were explored, but that these changed remarkably little over time. In the human &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N however we found a significant increase with time across the different archaeological cultures. This trend could be observed in all time periods and archaeological cultures (Bell Beaker phenomenon excluded), even on continuously populated sites. Since there was no such trend in faunal isotope values, we were able largely to exclude manuring as the cause of this effect. Based on the rich interdisciplinary data from this region and archaeological period we can argue that meat consumption increased with the increasing duration of farming subsistence.

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of 26–28 genes at chromosome band 7q11.23. The complete deletion (CD) mouse model mimics the most common deletion found in WBS patients and recapitulates most neurologic features of the disorder along with some cardiovascular manifestations leading to significant cardiac hypertrophy with increased cardiomyocytes’ size. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin found in green tea, has been associated with potential health benefits, both on cognition and cardiovascular phenotypes, through several mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of green tea extracts on WBS-related phenotypes through a phase I clinical trial in mice.

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of 26–28 genes at chromosome band 7q11.23. The complete deletion (CD) mouse model mimics the most common deletion found in WBS patients and recapitulates most neurologic features of the disorder along with some cardiovascular manifestations leading to significant cardiac hypertrophy with increased cardiomyocytes’ size. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin found in green tea, has been associated with potential health benefits, both on cognition and cardiovascular phenotypes, through several mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of green tea extracts on WBS-related phenotypes through a phase I clinical trial in mice. After feeding CD animals with green tea extracts dissolved in the drinking water, starting at three different time periods (prenatal, youth and adulthood), a set of behavioral tests and several anatomical, histological and molecular analyses were performed. Treatment resulted to be effective in the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and was also able to ameliorate short-term memory deficits of CD mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EGCG might have a therapeutic and/or preventive role in the management of WBS.</description><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194476</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_162b039947a:1dcc861:923c4a60</id><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525b</link><published>1523343600000</published><title>Corrigendum: Suppression of luteinizing hormone enhances HSC recovery after hematopoietic injury</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrigendum: Suppression of luteinizing hormone enhances HSC recovery after hematopoietic injury&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum: Suppression of luteinizing hormone enhances HSC recovery after hematopoietic injury, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525b&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-525b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Corrigendum: Suppression of luteinizing hormone enhances HSC recovery after hematopoietic injury&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/pWvVRGsVu9E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2dee74d7</fingerprint><author><name>Enrico Velardi</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525b</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525b</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrigendum: Suppression of luteinizing hormone enhances HSC recovery after hematopoietic injury&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigendum: Suppression of luteinizing hormone enhances HSC recovery after hematopoietic injury, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-525b&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-525b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Corrigendum: Suppression of luteinizing hormone enhances HSC recovery after hematopoietic injury&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/pWvVRGsVu9E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523374986362</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/pWvVRGsVu9E/nm0418-525b</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:63522cc:34f43e70</id><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1522168915000</published><title>Predicting cancer outcomes from histology and genomics using convolutional networks [Medical Sciences]</title><content><content>Cancer histology reflects underlying molecular processes and disease progression and contains rich phenotypic information that is predictive of patient outcomes.

In this study, we assess the dynamic evolution of short-term correlation, long-term cointegration and Error Correction Model (hereafter referred to as ECM)-based long-term Granger causality between each pair of US, UK, and Eurozone stock markets from 1980 to 2015 using the rolling-window technique. A comparative analysis of pairwise dynamic integration and causality of stock markets, measured in common and domestic currency terms, is conducted to evaluate comprehensively how exchange rate fluctuations affect the time-varying integration among the S&amp;amp;P 500, FTSE 100 and EURO STOXX 50 indices. The results obtained show that the dynamic correlation, cointegration and ECM-based long-run Granger causality vary significantly over the whole sample period. The degree of dynamic correlation and cointegration between pairs of stock markets rises in periods of high volatility and uncertainty, especially under the influence of economic, financial and political shocks. Meanwhile, we observe the weaker and decreasing correlation and cointegration among the three developed stock markets during the recovery periods. Interestingly, the most persistent and significant cointegration among the three developed stock markets exists during the 2007–09 global financial crisis. Finally, the exchange rate fluctuations, also influence the dynamic integration and causality between all pairs of stock indices, with that influence increasing under the local currency terms. Our results suggest that the potential for diversifying risk by investing in the US, UK and Eurozone stock markets is limited during the periods of economic, financial and political shocks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194067</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>4addde7a</fingerprint><author><name>Yanhua Chen</name></author><updated>1520888400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194067</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanhua Chen, Rosario N.

These results suggest that RAs produced by Aldh1a1 in the neural retina directs dorsal choroidal vascular development via Sox9 upregulation in the dorsal RPE cells to enhance RPE-derived VEGF secretion.</description><crawled>1522739162340</crawled><engagement>163</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32358</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162209f733c:619965:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1520924400000</published><title>Limited uptake of essential amino acid is effective for cancer therapy in metabolic networks of integrated constraint-based models [NEW RESULTS]</title><content><content>Nam models are context-specific genome-scale metabolic models for nine types of cancer and corresponding normal cells reconstructed from RECON 2, genetic mutation information, and expression profile data.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Traffic accidents are associated with the visual function of drivers, as well as many other factors. Driving simulator systems have the advantage of controlling for traffic- and automobile-related conditions, and using pinhole glasses can control the degree of concentric concentration of the visual field. We evaluated the effect of concentric constriction of the visual field on automobile driving, using driving simulator tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subjects meeting criteria for normal eyesight were included in the study. Pinhole glasses with variable aperture sizes were adjusted to mimic the conditions of concentric visual field constrictions of 10° and 15°, using a CLOCK CHART&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. The test contained 8 scenarios (2 oncoming right-turning cars and 6 jump-out events from the side).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighty-eight subjects were included in the study; 37 (mean age = 52.9±15.8 years) subjects were assigned to the 15° group, and 51 (mean = 48.6±15.5 years) were assigned to the 10° group. For all 8 scenarios, the number of accidents was significantly higher among pinhole wearing subjects. The average number of all types of accidents per person was significantly higher in the pinhole 10° group (4.59±1.81) than the pinhole 15° group (3.68±1.49) (P = 0.032).

The polyphagous insect-pest, &lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa armigera&lt;/i&gt;, is a serious threat to a number of economically important crops. Chemical application and/or cultivation of &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; transgenic crops are the two strategies available now for insect-pest management. However, environmental pollution and long-term sustainability are major concerns against these two options. RNAi is now considered as a promising technology to complement &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; to tackle insect-pests menace. In this study, we report host-delivered silencing of &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt; gene, encoding the predominant isoform of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armigera&lt;/i&gt; acetylcholinesterase, by an artificial microRNA, &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1.

The polyphagous insect-pest, &lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa armigera&lt;/i&gt;, is a serious threat to a number of economically important crops. Chemical application and/or cultivation of &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; transgenic crops are the two strategies available now for insect-pest management. However, environmental pollution and long-term sustainability are major concerns against these two options. RNAi is now considered as a promising technology to complement &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; to tackle insect-pests menace. In this study, we report host-delivered silencing of &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt; gene, encoding the predominant isoform of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armigera&lt;/i&gt; acetylcholinesterase, by an artificial microRNA, &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1. Arabidopsis pre-miRNA164b was modified by replacing miR164b/miR164b* sequences with &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1/&lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1* sequences.

Coletta, Matthew M. Mallette, David A. Gabriel, Christopher J. Tyler, Stephen S. Cheung&lt;/p&gt;
The large body of work demonstrating hyperthermic impairment of neuromuscular function has utilized maximal isometric contractions, but extrapolating these findings to whole-body exercise and submaximal, dynamic contractions may be problematic. We isolated and compared core and skin temperature influences on an isometric force task versus a position task requiring dynamic maintenance of joint angle. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on the flexor carpi radialis at 60% of baseline maximal voluntary contraction while either pushing against a rigid restraint (force task) or while maintaining a constant wrist angle and supporting an equivalent inertial load (position task). Twenty participants performed each task at 0.5°C rectal temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;) intervals while being passively heated from 37.1±0.3°C to ≥1.5°C T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; and then cooled to 37.8±0.3°C, permitting separate analyses of core versus skin temperature influences. During a 3-s contraction, trend analysis revealed a quadratic trend that peaked during hyperthermia for root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude during the force task. In contrast, RMS amplitude during the position task remained stable with passive heating, then rapidly increased with the initial decrease in skin temperature at the onset of passive cooling (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010). Combined hot core and hot skin elicited shifts toward higher frequencies in the sEMG signal during the force task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), whereas inconsistent changes in the frequency spectra occurred for the position task. Based on the patterns of RMS amplitude in response to thermal stress, we conclude that core temperature was the primary thermal afferent influencing neuromuscular response during a submaximal force task, with minimal input from skin temperature. However, skin temperature was the primary thermal afferent during a position task with minimal core temperature influence. Therefore, temperature has a task-dependent impact on neuromuscular responses.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195219</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>8544f1bc</fingerprint><author><name>Nico A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20–62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012.

Background &lt;p&gt;Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20–62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012. Soldiers were clustered into different military occupational specialties: Infantry, Administration, Logistics, Logistics/Camp, Medical and Other. Data were collected through the use of the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol at the end of the international mission.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven percent reported MSCI during deployment, with 28% at the end.The most common locations of MSCI during the mission were lower back, knee, shoulders, upper back, neck and foot, while the knee and lower back prevailed at the end of the mission.

Despite the double burden of infectious and chronic non-communicable diseases in Africa, health care expenditure disproportionately favours infectious diseases. In this paper, we examine quantitatively the extent of this disproportionate access to diagnoses and treatment of diabetes, hypertension and malaria in Ghana. A total of 220 health facilities was surveyed across the country in 2011. Findings indicate that diagnoses and treatment of infectious diseases were more accessible than NCDs. In terms of treatment, 78% and 87% of health facilities had two of the recommended malaria drugs while less than 35% had essential diabetes and hypertension drugs. There is a significant unmet need for diagnoses and treatment of NCDs in Ghana. These inequities have implications for high morbidity and mortality from NCDs.

Efros, Samuel Andrew Hires&lt;/p&gt;
Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1522182248935</recrawled><crawled>1522172570172</crawled><updated>1522184400000</updated><fingerprint>c4a8f063</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006032</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006032</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Vaxenburg, Isis Wyche, Karel Svoboda, Alexander L.

Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description><crawled>1522950070448</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293670v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1622b92a890:dafc9a:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1521003397000</published><title>Complexation reactions in pyridine and 2,6-dimethylpyridine-water system: The quantum-chemical description and the path to liquid phase separation</title><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/10&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 10&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4d921b34</fingerprint><author><name>Zelig Chernia</name></author><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010177?af=R</link><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010177?af=R</originId><unread>False</unread><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1521149454480</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5010177?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162ab028058:15e068b:923c4a60</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1523257200000</published><title>Learning recurrent dynamics in spiking networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><content><content>Spiking activity of neurons engaged in learning and performing a task show complex spatiotemporal dynamics.

Various sociocultural factors affect healthcare-seeking behaviors. In Taiwanese society, superstitions and lunar festivals play important roles in people’s lives. We investigated the impact of “Ghost Month” (the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month) and Chinese New Year (the 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month and the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month of the following year) on the number of elective surgeries and emergent surgeries in Taiwan. The number of total knee replacement (TKR) surgeries and proximal femur fracture (PFF) surgeries in each lunar month from 2000 to 2011 were extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, a computerized and population-based database. Patients were then sorted by location of residence or gender. The average number of TKR surgeries performed was significantly lower during the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months in urban areas, whereas in rural areas this trend was only evident in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months. There was however, no significant difference in the average number of PFF surgeries in each lunar month except for an increase seen in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month in rural patients (p&amp;lt;0.05). When sorted by gender, the average number of TKR surgeries was significantly decreased in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months in male patients, and decreased in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months in female patients.

The cold-water coral &lt;i&gt;Lophelia pertusa&lt;/i&gt; is an ecosystem engineer that builds reef structures on the seafloor. The interaction of the reef topography with hydrodynamics is known to enhance the supply of suspended food sources to the reef communities. However, the reef framework is also a substrate for other organisms that may compete for the very same suspended food sources. Here, we used the passive suspension feeder &lt;i&gt;Lophelia pertusa&lt;/i&gt; and the active suspension feeding sponge &lt;i&gt;Hymedesmia coriacea&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms to study niche overlap using isotopically-enriched algae and bacteria as suspended food sources. The coral and the sponge were fed with a combination of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched bacteria/&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-enriched algae or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-enriched bacteria/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-enriched algae, which was subsequently traced into bulk tissue, coral skeleton and dissolved inorganic carbon (i.e. respiration). Both the coral and the sponge assimilated and respired the suspended bacteria and algae, indicating niche overlap between these species. The assimilation rates of C and N into bulk tissue of specimens incubated separately were not significantly different from assimilation rates during incubations with co-occurring corals and sponges. Hence, no evidence for exploitative resource competition was found, but this is likely due to the saturating experimental food concentration that was used. We do not rule out that exploitative competition occurs in nature during periods of low food concentrations. Food assimilation and respiration rates of the sponge were almost an order of magnitude higher than those of the cold-water coral. We hypothesize that the active suspension feeding mode of the sponge explains the observed differences in resource uptake as opposed to the passive suspension feeding mode of the cold-water coral. These feeding mode differences may set constraints on suitable habitats for cold-water corals and sponges in their natural habitats.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>88bebd50</fingerprint><author><name>Dick van Oevelen</name></author><updated>1522098000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194659</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dick van Oevelen, Christina E.

Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>97dca45</fingerprint><author><name>Guillaume Lhermie</name></author><updated>1521752400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Lhermie, Loren William Tauer, Yrjo Tapio Gröhn&lt;/p&gt;

Molecular characterization of early hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains rare. Ten out of 78 patients of a hematology/oncology center were found to be HCV RNA positive two to four months after hospitalization. Only two of the ten patients were anti-HCV positive. HCV hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) was amplified in seven patients (including one anti-HCV positive) and analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS). Genetic variants were reconstructed by Shorah and an empirically established 0.5% variant frequency cut-off was implemented. These sequences were compared by phylogenetic and diversity analyses. Ten unrelated blood donors with newly acquired HCV infection detected at the time of donation (HCV RNA positive and anti-HCV negative) served as controls. One to seven HVR1 variants were found in each patient. Sequences intermixed phylogenetically with no evidence of clustering in individual patients. These sequences were more similar to each other (similarity 95.4% to 100.0%) than to those of controls (similarity 64.8% to 82.6%). An identical predominant variant was present in four patients, whereas other closely related variants dominated in the remaining three patients.

Molecular characterization of early hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains rare. Ten out of 78 patients of a hematology/oncology center were found to be HCV RNA positive two to four months after hospitalization. Only two of the ten patients were anti-HCV positive. HCV hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) was amplified in seven patients (including one anti-HCV positive) and analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS). Genetic variants were reconstructed by Shorah and an empirically established 0.5% variant frequency cut-off was implemented. These sequences were compared by phylogenetic and diversity analyses. Ten unrelated blood donors with newly acquired HCV infection detected at the time of donation (HCV RNA positive and anti-HCV negative) served as controls. One to seven HVR1 variants were found in each patient. Sequences intermixed phylogenetically with no evidence of clustering in individual patients. These sequences were more similar to each other (similarity 95.4% to 100.0%) than to those of controls (similarity 64.8% to 82.6%). An identical predominant variant was present in four patients, whereas other closely related variants dominated in the remaining three patients. In five patients the HCV population was limited to a single variant or one predominant variant and minor variants of less than 10% frequency. In conclusion, NGS analysis of a cluster of HCV infections acquired in the hospital setting revealed the presence of low diversity, very closely related variants in all patients, suggesting an early-stage infection with the same virus. NGS combined with phylogenetic analysis and classical epidemiological analysis could help in tracking of HCV outbreaks.</description><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194816</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162aed81c76:1bbfa89:9aea0a7d</id><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23965-4</link><published>1523343600000</published><title>Gestational exposure to metformin programs improved glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in adult male mouse offspring</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gestational exposure to metformin programs improved glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in adult male mouse offspring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gestational exposure to metformin programs improved glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in adult male mouse offspring, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23965-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23965-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Gestational exposure to metformin programs improved glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in adult male mouse offspring&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/LA4tGkDu83g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e695da8a</fingerprint><author><name>Brigid E.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4, and 8 reportedly contribute to progression of metabolic disease, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether circulating ANGPTL levels are associated with CVD risk after adjustment for potential confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a single center, cross-sectional study of 988 Japanese subjects undergoing routine health checks. Serum ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using multiple regression analysis we evaluated potential association of circulating ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels with general medical status including age, sex, smoking, drinking, obesity, hypertension, impaired glycometabolism, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, hepatic impairment, chronic kidney disease, anemia, cardiac abnormality, and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Circulating ANGPTL3 levels were relatively high in health-related categories of hepatic impairment and inflammation. Circulating ANGPTL4 levels were also significantly high in impaired glycometabolism or hepatic impairment but decreased in inflammation. Finally, increased ANGPTL8 levels were observed in obesity, impaired glycometabolism and dyslipidemia. Particularly, increased levels of circulating ANGPTL8 were positively correlated with circulating triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels and inversely correlated with circulating HDL-cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Circulating ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels reflect some risk factors for CVD development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193731</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>1fc209c9</fingerprint><author><name>Jun Morinaga</name></author><updated>1521061200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193731</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jun Morinaga, Jiabin Zhao, Motoyoshi Endo, Tsuyoshi Kadomatsu, Keishi Miyata, Taichi Sugizaki, Yusuke Okadome, Zhe Tian, Haruki Horiguchi, Kazuya Miyashita, Nobuhiro Maruyama, Masashi Mukoyama, Yuichi Oike&lt;/p&gt;

Aranbaltza is an archaeological complex formed by at least three open-air sites. Between 2014 and 2015 a test excavation carried out in Aranbaltza III revealed the presence of a sand and clay sedimentary sequence formed in floodplain environments, within which six sedimentary units have been identified. This sequence was formed between 137–50 ka, and includes several archaeological horizons, attesting to the long-term presence of Neanderthal communities in this area. One of these horizons, corresponding with Unit 4, yielded two wooden tools. One of these tools is a beveled pointed tool that was shaped through a complex operational sequence involving branch shaping, bark peeling, twig removal, shaping, polishing, thermal exposition and chopping. A use-wear analysis of the tool shows it to have traces related with digging soil so it has been interpreted as representing a digging stick. This is the first time such a tool has been identified in a European Late Middle Palaeolithic context; it also represents one of the first well-preserved Middle Palaeolithic wooden tool found in southern Europe.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To examine whether psychosocial work characteristics at age 45 years predict exit from the labour market by the age of 50 years in data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Psychosocial work characteristics (decision latitude, job demands, job strain and work social support at 45 years and job insecurity at 42 years) measured by questionnaire were linked to employment outcomes (unemployment, retirement, permanent sickness, homemaking) at 50 years in 6510 male and female participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Low decision latitude (RR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.06,3.79), low work social support (RR = 1.96, 95%CI 1.12,3.44), and high job insecurity (RR = 2.27, 95%CI 1.41, 3.67) predicted unemployment at 50, adjusting for sex, housing tenure, socioeconomic status, marital status, and education. High demands were associated with lower risk of unemployment (RR = 0.50, 95%CI 0.29,0.88) but higher risk of permanent sickness (RR = 2.14, 95%CI 1.09,4.21).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Keeping people in the workforce beyond 50 years may contribute to both personal and national prosperity.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To examine whether psychosocial work characteristics at age 45 years predict exit from the labour market by the age of 50 years in data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Psychosocial work characteristics (decision latitude, job demands, job strain and work social support at 45 years and job insecurity at 42 years) measured by questionnaire were linked to employment outcomes (unemployment, retirement, permanent sickness, homemaking) at 50 years in 6510 male and female participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Low decision latitude (RR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.06,3.79), low work social support (RR = 1.96, 95%CI 1.12,3.44), and high job insecurity (RR = 2.27, 95%CI 1.41, 3.67) predicted unemployment at 50, adjusting for sex, housing tenure, socioeconomic status, marital status, and education. High demands were associated with lower risk of unemployment (RR = 0.50, 95%CI 0.29,0.88) but higher risk of permanent sickness (RR = 2.14, 95%CI 1.09,4.21).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Keeping people in the workforce beyond 50 years may contribute to both personal and national prosperity. Employers may wish to improve working conditions for older workers, in particular, increase control over work, increase support and reduce demands to retain older employees in the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195495</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1626d6bb5e4:3a8a85:bdf8aaf1</id><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12484/20180328/images/medium/jp-2017-12484j_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12484&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

That, put simply, is a different crystalline form, and any given substance can have several. Or a lot more than several. I don’t know what the record is for any single compound, but it’s way up into the dozens, and you never know when a new one might show up. You can get these different forms through all sorts of variations in the way the compound is crystallized or precipitated: different solvents, different temperatures, different types of stirring (yes indeed), different concentrations. . .and we haven’t even gotten to hydrates and solvates, where molecules of water or other solvents are incorporated into the crystal structure as it forms. And &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; can have polymorphs in turn, or different ratios of water and solvent, and there’s just no end to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymorphs can behave completely differently from each other. The same substance, completely pure, can come out looking like several unmistakable crystal types (rods, prisms, plates), in different crystalline space groups, with completely different melting points and solubility behavior. Past blog posts on this are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/10/22/phenylalanine_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/08/25/polymorphs_and_salts_india_raises_an_eyebrow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2011/01/12/gassing_your_crystals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/01/novartis_loses_the_glivec_patent_fight_in_india&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and as that last one illustrates, this is definitely not something of just theoretical interest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=17333&quot;&gt;The saga&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-HIV drug Ritonavir is the classic example. That altered solubility behavior is of tremendous importance for drug dosing, and in Ritonavir’s case, a more stable (and less desirable!) polymorph appeared and threatened to disrupt the entire supply of the drug, because after a while, it was appearing more and more in the production line. “More stable”, of course, can easily mean “so stable it would rather not dissolve and get into the bloodstream”. Polymorphs themselves can be patented separately over such meaningful differences, as can methods for their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even very simple compounds can show grindingly complex behavior. Aspirin, for example, exists in two polymorphs (so far) that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.200603373&quot;&gt;so similar&lt;/a&gt; that they can both show up &lt;em&gt;in the same single crystal&lt;/em&gt;, and it takes good X-ray data (and a good X-ray crystallographer) to work out what’s going on. One of those past blog post links is about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/blog/post-42/&quot;&gt;trickiness of phenylalanine&lt;/a&gt;, a substance you’d think had been studied to pieces by now. But as that link shows, D-ribose is in the same category: the crystallographic literature for years was all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about something even more simple than those? I refer to the most simple amino acid of all, glycine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.201800741&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has some details on its polymorphs, and the ridiculously subtle effects that cause them to form. There are three that form under “normal” conditions from aqueous solution, and while the gamma one is the most thermodynamically stable, the alpha one is kinetically favored. Adding small amounts of simple alcohols to the aqueous solution starts producing mixtures of the alpha and beta forms, though, and eventually, as the alcohol concentration goes up, you only get the beta form. All classic polymorph behavior. But why? Here’s what the authors found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the alpha-form starts growing in a pyramidal shape, just as it usually does, but then starts incorporating methanol-solvated glycine molecules into its growing lattice. This buries methanol molecules into the crystal as it continues forming, and creates zones of higher polarity because of the different orientation of those solvated glycines (and the slight deformations in the nearest neighbor glycine arrangements as well). The normal arrangement in the crystal is a sort of “canceled-out” glycine dimer, but that gets disrupted into a more polarizable form. That’s the origin of the pyroelectric effect they’re able to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this starts happening, that developing surface of the crystal ends up “poisoned”, as some molecular dynamic simulations suggest, by the methanols incorporated into the lattice. The new surface doesn’t recognize the usual glycine-dimer form so readily, and further growth is inhibited – you see truncated pyramids of the alpha-form that have stopped in their tracks. Meanwhile, the beta-form end up with one surface (a more hydrophilic one) similarly poisoned and inhibited, but another one (a more hydrophobic one) is totally unaffected, so the crystal grows more rapidly along that face and produces long rods of the beta-form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of detail answers some questions and raises others. There are probably all sorts of metastable crystal forms (and crystal surfaces) showing up in complex polymorph situations, and the ability to see and characterize these things will (as in this case) give us a better physical picture of what’s going on. But predicting such behavior is another thing entirely. You’d hope as we start to pile up enough detail that predictive power will start to emerge (hello, machine learning). That’s a reasonable hope, but there’s no reason that things have to work out that way. The whole “Big Data” effort across various sciences is putting that view of the world to the test, and sometimes it’s going to work out and sometimes it isn’t. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><keywords><item>Chemical News</item><item>In Silico</item></keywords><fingerprint>f3b17c38</fingerprint><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/28/down-at-the-crystal-surface</canonicalUrl><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13409</link><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13409</originId><unread>True</unread><description>If you’re at all involved in producing solid forms of compounds, you’re familiar with the concept of a polymorph.

Background &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a highly sensitive test for TB diagnosis, but still costly to most low-income countries. Several implementation strategies instead of frontline have been suggested; however with scarce data. We assessed accuracy of different Xpert MTB/RIF implementation strategies to inform national roll-out.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study of 1,924 adult presumptive TB patients in five regional referral hospitals of Uganda. Two sputum samples were collected, one for fluorescent microscopy (FM) and Xpert MTB/RIF examined at the study site laboratories. The second sample was sent to the Uganda Supra National TB reference laboratory for culture using both Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) and liquid culture (MGIT). We compared the sensitivities of FM, Xpert MTB/RIF and the incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF among patients negative on FM using LJ and/or MGIT as a reference standard.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total 1924 patients were enrolled of which 1596 (83%) patients had at least one laboratory result and 1083 respondents had a complete set of all the laboratory results. A total of 328 (30%) were TB positive on LJ and /or MGIT culture. The sensitivity of FM was n (%; 95% confidence interval) 246 (63.5%; 57.9–68.7) overall compared to 52 (55.4%; 44.1–66.3) among HIV positive individuals, while the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 300 (76.2%; 71.7–80.7) and 69 (71.6%; 60.5–81.1) overall and among HIV positive individuals respectively. Overall incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 60 (36.5%; 27.7–46.0) and 20 (41.7%; 25.5–59.2) among HIV positive individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF has a higher sensitivity than FM both in general population and HIV positive population. Xpert MTB/RIF offers a significant increase in terms of diagnostic sensitivity even when it is deployed selectively i.e. among smear negative presumptive TB patients. Our results support frontline use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in high HIV/TB prevalent countries. In settings with limited access, mechanisms to refer smear negative sputum samples to Xpert MTB/RIF hubs are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194741</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>b58af99e</fingerprint><author><name>Winters Muttamba</name></author><updated>1521752400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194741</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Winters Muttamba, Willy Ssengooba, Rogers Sekibira, Bruce Kirenga, Achilles Katamba, Moses Joloba&lt;/p&gt;

Overall incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 60 (36.5%; 27.7–46.0) and 20 (41.7%; 25.5–59.2) among HIV positive individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF has a higher sensitivity than FM both in general population and HIV positive population. Xpert MTB/RIF offers a significant increase in terms of diagnostic sensitivity even when it is deployed selectively i.e. among smear negative presumptive TB patients. Our results support frontline use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in high HIV/TB prevalent countries. In settings with limited access, mechanisms to refer smear negative sputum samples to Xpert MTB/RIF hubs are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194741</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_16240988fb5:15d013:a077e55f</id><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02098/20180319/images/medium/jp-2018-02098h_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02098&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARα)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Egl nine homolog 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;EGLN3)&lt;/i&gt; play critical roles in facilitating the adaptation to a hypoxic environment. However, the relationship between &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; variants and hypoxic adaptation remains poorly understood in Tibetan chickens. To better understand the effects of genetic variation, we sequenced exons of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; in 138 Lowland chickens (LC) from 7 breeds that were located in Emei, Miyi, Shimian, Wanyuan, Pengxian, and Muchuan in the Sichuan province, and Wenchang in the Hainan province (altitudes for these locations are below 1800 meters). Total 166 Tibetan chickens (TC) from 7 subpopulations that were located in Shigatse, Lhoka, Lhasa, Garze, Aba, Diqing and Yushu in the Tibetan area were also sequenced (altitudes greater than 2700 meters). One single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs316017491, C &gt; T) was identified in &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and was shared by TC and LC with no significant difference for allele frequencies between them (P &gt; 0.05). Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP1, A29410G; SNP2, rs13886097; SNP3, T29467C; SNP4, rs735915170; SNP5, rs736599044; and SNP6, rs740077421) including one non-synonymous mutation (SNP2, T &gt; C) were identified in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. This is the first report of SNP1 and SNP3. There was a difference between TC and LC for allele frequencies (P &amp;lt;0.01), except for SNP1, SNP4, and SNP5) The fix index statistic test indicated that there was population differentiation between TC and LC for SNP2, SNP3, and SNP6 in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic distance among chickens, finch and great tit were close for both &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. Bioinformatics analysis of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; showed that SNP2 leads to an amino acid substitution of Ile for Met, which results in the protein being more likely to be hydrolyzed. Thus, genetic variation in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; may play a role in the ability of TC to adapt to a high altitude environment; however we were unable to identify a relationship between polymorphisms in &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and environmental adaptability.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194156</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>c2c5e046</fingerprint><author><name>ChengLin Zhong</name></author><updated>1521147600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194156</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by ChengLin Zhong, SiChen Li, JingJing Li, FengPeng Li, MingXia Ran, LingYun Qiu, DiYan Li, Qing Zhu, Yan Wang, HuaDong Yin, Gang Shu, Chaowu Yang, XiaoLing Zhao&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;A number of studies have investigated cognitive impairment in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) but deficits regarding executive functions have not been comprehensively assessed up to now. This study was meant to explore cognitive impairment in German paediatric MS patients with a focus on deficits in executive functions and relate these to clinical disease parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Forty paediatric MS patients, which presented at the German centre for MS in childhood and adolescence, were assessed for cognitive deficits applying a very comprehensive battery of cognitive tests including the Wechsler Intelligence scale and subtests of the D-KEFS for executive functions. The performance of MS patients was compared with a group of age and sex matched healthy controls using between-subjects ANOVAs. Paediatric MS patients performed worse in tests assessing verbal comprehension and fluency, processing speed, memory, calculation skills and other executive functions. Arranged by the cognitive domain, group differences were most pronounced regarding verbal comprehension and fluency for the WISC subtests Comprehension (p = 0.000), Vocabulary (p = 0.003) and Information (p = 0.005); regarding processing speed for the written SDMT (p = 0.001) and the WISC subtest Coding (p = 0.005); regarding memory for the VLMT training (p = 0.007) and the BASIC MLT pattern learning training (p = 0.009); regarding executive functions including working memory for the WISC subtest Arithmetics (p = 0.002), the D-KEFS Design Fluency (p = 0.003) and the Corsi block tapping backward task (p = 0.003). Fluid reasoning was largely intact. Relations of cognitive performance and clinical parameters were assessed in MS patients. Disease duration was associated with a reduced performance in tests belonging to the domains verbal comprehension and fluency (WISC Vocabulary: p = 0.034, WISC Information: p = 0.015) and fluid reasoning (WISC Picture Completion: p = 0.003) as well as the WISC Working Memory Index (p = 0.047). Patients with a disease onset between 11 and 14 years performed better in fluid reasoning (WISC matrix reasoning: p = 0.024) than patients with a disease onset at an age above 14. The number of relapses negatively influenced the visual spatial memory performance (BASIC MLT pattern learning training: p = 0.009).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The distribution of cognitive deficits in a representative group German of paediatric MS patients was similar to the pattern known from other European and North-American cohorts.

Background &lt;p&gt;A number of studies have investigated cognitive impairment in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) but deficits regarding executive functions have not been comprehensively assessed up to now. This study was meant to explore cognitive impairment in German paediatric MS patients with a focus on deficits in executive functions and relate these to clinical disease parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Forty paediatric MS patients, which presented at the German centre for MS in childhood and adolescence, were assessed for cognitive deficits applying a very comprehensive battery of cognitive tests including the Wechsler Intelligence scale and subtests of the D-KEFS for executive functions. The performance of MS patients was compared with a group of age and sex matched healthy controls using between-subjects ANOVAs. Paediatric MS patients performed worse in tests assessing verbal comprehension and fluency, processing speed, memory, calculation skills and other executive functions. Arranged by the cognitive domain, group differences were most pronounced regarding verbal comprehension and fluency for the WISC subtests Comprehension (p = 0.000), Vocabulary (p = 0.003) and Information (p = 0.005); regarding processing speed for the written SDMT (p = 0.001) and the WISC subtest Coding (p = 0.005); regarding memory for the VLMT training (p = 0.007) and the BASIC MLT pattern learning training (p = 0.009); regarding executive functions including working memory for the WISC subtest Arithmetics (p = 0.002), the D-KEFS Design Fluency (p = 0.003) and the Corsi block tapping backward task (p = 0.003). Fluid reasoning was largely intact. Relations of cognitive performance and clinical parameters were assessed in MS patients. Disease duration was associated with a reduced performance in tests belonging to the domains verbal comprehension and fluency (WISC Vocabulary: p = 0.034, WISC Information: p = 0.015) and fluid reasoning (WISC Picture Completion: p = 0.003) as well as the WISC Working Memory Index (p = 0.047). Patients with a disease onset between 11 and 14 years performed better in fluid reasoning (WISC matrix reasoning: p = 0.024) than patients with a disease onset at an age above 14. The number of relapses negatively influenced the visual spatial memory performance (BASIC MLT pattern learning training: p = 0.009).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The distribution of cognitive deficits in a representative group German of paediatric MS patients was similar to the pattern known from other European and North-American cohorts. Paediatric MS patients do have cognitive deficits in executive functions and key qualities necessary for successful school performance. Disease duration, age of onset and the number of relapses influence cognitive performance. Cognitive screenings should be implemented on a regular basis for paediatric MS patients, enabling early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194873</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d25113:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1521135592000</published><title>Rev-erb{alpha} dynamically modulates chromatin looping to control circadian gene transcription</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Mammalian physiology exhibits 24-hour cyclicity due to circadian rhythms of gene expression controlled by transcription factors that constitute molecular clocks.

Despite large efforts, datasets with few sightings are often available for rare species of marine megafauna that typically live at low densities. This paucity of data makes modelling the habitat of these taxa particularly challenging. We tested the predictive performance of different types of species distribution models fitted to decreasing numbers of sightings. Generalised additive models (GAMs) with three different residual distributions and the presence only model MaxEnt were tested on two megafauna case studies differing in both the number of sightings and ecological niches. From a dolphin (277 sightings) and an auk (1,455 sightings) datasets, we simulated rarity with a sighting thinning protocol by random sampling (without replacement) of a decreasing fraction of sightings. Better prediction of the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a narrow habitat (auk dataset) was expected compared to the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a broad habitat (dolphin dataset). We used the original datasets to set up a baseline model and fitted additional models on fewer sightings but keeping effort constant. Model predictive performance was assessed with mean squared error and area under the curve. Predictions provided by the models fitted to the thinned-out datasets were better than a homogeneous spatial distribution down to a threshold of approximately 30 sightings for a GAM with a Tweedie distribution and approximately 130 sightings for the other models. Thinning the sighting data for the taxon with narrower habitats seemed to be less detrimental to model predictive performance than for the broader habitat taxon. To generate reliable habitat modelling predictions for rarely sighted marine predators, our results suggest (1) using GAMs with a Tweedie distribution with presence-absence data and (2) implementing, as a conservative empirical measure, at least 50 sightings in the models.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193231</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>b23dbaec</fingerprint><author><name>Auriane Virgili</name></author><updated>1520888400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193231</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Auriane Virgili, Matthieu Authier, Pascal Monestiez, Vincent Ridoux&lt;/p&gt;

Background and objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical implications of the discordance between the risk of exacerbations and the level of airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are still unknown.

The data, collected by the Taiwan Obstructive Lung Disease consortium, were managed and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the enrolled participants, 316 (41.7%) had an inconsistency between the risk of exacerbations and the severity of airflow limitation. Univariate analysis showed that more severe airflow limitation (p = 0.000), higher COPD assessment test (CAT) scores (p = 0.003) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scales (p = 0.008), and the presence of at least one (p = 0.000) or two (p = 0.003) co-morbidities were significantly associated with such inconsistency. More severe airflow limitation (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 3 and 4 classification; odds ratio (OR) = 27.09, p = 0.000 and OR = 25.15, p = 0.000, respectively) and the presence of at least one co-morbidity (OR = 2.01, p = 0.001) were still associated with the inconsistency in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the presence of wheezing (OR = 3.90, p = 0.000) and at least two co-morbidities (OR = 5.43, p = 0.005) were independent risk factors for an inconsistency of a high risk of exacerbations / GOLD 1 or 2 and the CAT score≧10 (OR = 1.58, p = 0.007), mMRC scale 2–4 (OR = 1.53, p = 0.017), and the presence of at least one co-morbidity (OR = 2.55, p = 0.000) for an inconsistency of a low risk of exacerbations / GOLD 3 or 4.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The patients with COPD and an inconsistency between the risk of exacerbations and level of airflow limitation had unique clinical characteristics and risk factors for this inconsistency.

As the first model reported that identifies and classifies normal and sclerotic glomeruli in frozen kidney sections, and thus the first model reported in the literature relevant to kidney transplantation, it may become an essential part of donor kidney biopsy evaluation in the clinical setting.</description><crawled>1522695796764</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292789v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162764edef1:7865ba6:34f43e70</id><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207</link><published>1522393200000</published><title>Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16207&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/puX5ZdDFh2A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3a769985</fingerprint><author><name>Vasilica Nache</name></author><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16207&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/puX5ZdDFh2A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1522403303153</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/puX5ZdDFh2A/ncomms16207</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1621b4b57ed:64b3a6b:7c9981b6</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193480</link><published>1520888400000</published><title>The impact of cognateness of word bases and suffixes on morpho-orthographic processing: A masked priming study with intermediate and high-proficiency Portuguese-English bilinguals</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Montserrat Comesaña, Pauline Bertin, Helena Oliveira, Ana Paula Soares, Juan Andrés Hernández-Cabrera, Séverine Casalis&lt;/p&gt;
Recent studies have suggested that proficient bilinguals show morphological decomposition in the L2, but the question remains as to whether this process is modulated by the cognateness of the morphemic constituents of L2 words and by L2 proficiency. To answer this question was the main goal of the present research. For that purpose, a masked priming lexical decision task was conducted manipulating for the first time the degree of orthographic overlap of the L2 word as a whole, as well as of their morphemic constituents (bases and suffixes). Thirty-four European Portuguese-English bilinguals (16 intermediate and 18 high-proficient) and 16 English native-speaking controls performed the task in English. Results revealed that both groups of bilinguals decomposed words as the native control group. Importantly, results also showed that morphological priming effects were sensitive not only to cross-language similarities of words as a whole, but also to their morphemic constituents (especially, suffixes).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193480</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>d671f977</fingerprint><author><name>Montserrat Comesaña</name></author><updated>1520888400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193480</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Montserrat Comesaña, Pauline Bertin, Helena Oliveira, Ana Paula Soares, Juan Andrés Hernández-Cabrera, Séverine Casalis&lt;/p&gt;

Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by a progressive loss of articular cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis and synovial inflammation and is the most common chronic condition worldwide today. However, most treatments have focused on pain relief and OA symptoms. For these reasons, many ongoing studies are currently trying to develop efficient and successful therapies based on its pathology. Animal models that mimic the histopathology and symptoms of OA have a critical role in OA research and make it possible to investigate both secondary osteoarthritic changes due to a precedent event such as traumatic injury and naturally occurring changes for the development of therapeutics which can be tested in preclinical and clinical OA trials. We induced OA in various animal models including rats, rabbits and guinea pigs by chemical, surgical and naturally occurring methods. In particular, the Dunkin-Hartley guinea pig is very attractive as an OA animal model because OA slowly progresses which is similar to human primary OA. Thus, this animal model mimics the pathophysiological process and environment of human primary OA. Besides the spontaneous OA model, anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) with medial meniscectomy and bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) as well as a chemical technique using sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) were used to induce OA. We found that ACLT in the rat model induced OA changes in the histology and micro-CT image compared to OVX. The osteoarthritic change significantly increased following ACLT surgery in the rabbit model. Furthermore, we identified that OA pathogenic changes occurred in a time-dependent manner in spontaneous Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs. The MIA injection model is a rapid and minimally invasive method for inducing OA in animal models, whereas the spontaneous OA model has a slow and gradual progression of OA similar to human primary OA. We observed that histological OA change was extraordinarily increased at 9 ½ months in the spontaneous OA model, and thus, the grade was similar with that of the MIA model. Therefore, this study reports on OA pathology using various animal models as well as the spontaneous results naturally occurring in an OA animal model which had developed cartilage lesions and progressive osteoarthritic changes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194288</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>496f38ce</fingerprint><author><name>Ji Eun Kim</name></author><updated>1520974800000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194288</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Eun Kim, Da-hyun Song, Soo Hyun Kim, Youngmee Jung, Sang Jun Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, alignment-free methods based on kmer composition have proven their ability to explore the accessory genome. However, they lead to redundant descriptions and results which are hard to interpret. Methods: Here, we introduce DBGWAS, an extended kmer-based GWAS method producing interpretable genetic variants associated with phenotypes. Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes identified by the association model into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is fast, alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. It produces annotated subgraphs representing local polymorphisms as well as mobile genetic elements (MGE) and offers a graphical framework to interpret GWAS results. Results: We validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - along with their MGE context. It also enabled us to formulate new hypotheses involving genetic variants not yet described in the antibiotic resistance literature. Conclusion: Our novel method proved its efficiency to retrieve any type of phenotype-associated genetic variant without prior knowledge.

The modulatory role of the primary motor cortex (M1), reflected by an inhibitory effect of M1-stimulation on clinical pain, motivated us to deepen our understanding of M1’s role in pain modulation. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced virtual lesion (VL) to interrupt with M1 activity during noxious heat pain. We hypothesized that TMS-VL will effect experimental pain ratings. Three VL protocols were applied consisting of single-pulse TMS to transiently interfere with right M1 activity: (1) VL&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt;- TMS applied to 11 subjects, 20 msec before the individual’s first pain-related M1 peak activation, as determined by source analysis (sLORETA), (2) VL&lt;sub&gt;-50&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 50 ms prior to noxious stimulus onset), and (3) VL&lt;sub&gt;+150&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 150 ms after noxious stimulus onset). Each protocol included 3 conditions (&apos;pain-alone&apos;, &apos; TMS-VL&apos;, and ‘SHAM-VL’), each consisted of 30 noxious heat stimuli. Pain ratings were compared, in each protocol, for TMS-VL vs. SHAM-VL and vs. pain-alone conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance, corrected for multiple comparisons revealed no significant differences in the pain ratings between the different conditions within each protocol. Therefore, our results from this exploratory study suggest that a single pulse TMS-induced VL that is targeted to M1 failed to interrupt experimental pain processing in the specific three stimulation timing examined here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>228e14c4</fingerprint><author><name>Lee-Bareket Kisler</name></author><updated>1523307600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lee-Bareket Kisler, Ilan Gurion, Yelena Granovsky, Alon Sinai, Elliot Sprecher, Simone Shamay-Tsoory, Irit Weissman-Fogel&lt;/p&gt;

The oriental armyworm, &lt;i&gt;Mythimna separata&lt;/i&gt;, is a major insect pest in China and other Asian countries. Unfortunately, suitable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) have not been previously identified in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;separata&lt;/i&gt; for normalizing target gene expression. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of eight candidate genes (&lt;i&gt;18S&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EF1-α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPS7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPS13&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPL32&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TUB&lt;/i&gt;) in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;separata&lt;/i&gt; using the comparative ΔCt method, BestKeeper, Normfinder geNorm and ReFinder, a comprehensive software platform.

Background &lt;p&gt;Unstable conditions of the craniocervical junction such as atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) or atlanto-axial instability (AAI) are severe injuries with a high risk of tetraplegia or death. Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown.The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system.In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9° of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement. In case of unstable craniocervical junction, this leads to a dural sac compression and thus to possible damage to the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4ad99bdb</fingerprint><author><name>Shiyao Liao</name></author><updated>1523048400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195215</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiyao Liao, Niko R.

European plum (&lt;i&gt;Prunus domestica&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an ancient domesticated species cultivated in temperate areas worldwide whose genetic structure has been scarcely analyzed to date. In this study, a broad representation of Spanish European plum germplasm collected in Northeastern Spain and a representative set of reference cultivars were compared using nuclear and chloroplast markers. The number of alleles per locus detected with the SSR markers ranged from 8 to 39, with an average of 23.4 alleles, and 8 haplotypes were identified. Bayesian model-based clustering, minimum spanning networks, and the analysis of molecular variance showed the existence of a hierarchical structure. At the first level, two genetic groups were found, one containing ‘Reine Claude’ type reference cultivars altogether with ca. 25% of local genotypes, and a second one much more diverse. This latter group split in two groups, one containing most (ca. 70%) local genotypes and some old Spanish and French reference cultivars, whereas the other included 24 reference cultivars and only six local genotypes. A third partition level allowed a significant finer delineation into five groups. As a whole, the genetic structure of European plum from Northeastern Spain was shown to be complex and conditioned by a geographical proximity factor. This study not only contributes to genetic conservation and breeding for this species at the national level, but also supports the relevance of undertaking similar tasks of collection and characterization in other unexplored areas. Moreover, this kind of research could lead to future coordinated actions for the examination of the whole European plum diversity, to define conservation strategies, and could be used to better understand the genetic control of traits of horticultural interest through association mapping.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195591</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>ec946bba</fingerprint><author><name>Jorge Urrestarazu</name></author><updated>1523307600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195591</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge Urrestarazu, Pilar Errea, Carlos Miranda, Luis G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the first step toward developing preventative strategies and optimizing care systems. We aimed to describe and compare epidemiological features and clinical outcomes among patients with anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs according to causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified emergency medical service (EMS)-treated anaphylaxis-associated OHCA patients from a nationwide OHCA registry between 2008 and 2015. We compared epidemiological characteristics and outcomes according to causal agents (a natural agents group and an iatrogenic agents group) and evaluated temporal variability in incidence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare survival to discharge between causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the study period (8 years), the total number of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs was 233. A total of 224 eligible cases were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients (85.6%) in the natural agents group and 32 patients (14.3%) in the iatrogenic agents group. There was significant diurnal and seasonal variability in the frequency of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values&amp;lt;0.01 for both), with the highest incidences occurring during the day (7:01 am to 3 pm; 64.6%) and in summer (June to August, 48.7%). Compared with the natural agents group, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for survival to discharge in the iatrogenic agents group was statistically insignificant (AOR 3.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 15.06).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is considerably low, and significant temporal variability, with a peak during the day and in summer, is evident.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical significance of the laboratory-based phenomenon of clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness and platelet reactivity associated with acute myocardial infarction, despite chronic clopidogrel therapy, is largely unknown. We aimed to determine platelet reactivity and clinical and angiographic features in 29 consecutive patients sustaining an acute myocardial infarction despite chronic (≥1 month) clopidogrel therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Platelet reactivity was determined on admission using conventional aggregometry. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 24 hours of admission. Patients were matched with clopidogrel-naïve acute myocardial infarction patients. Clopidogrel-naïve patients received a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose and 75 mg/day thereafter.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 29 study patients, 19 (66%) presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and in 25% the infarction was related to angiographically-proved definite stent thrombosis. Two-thirds of these patients were poor responders to clopidogrel (adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation &gt;50%) and dual antiplatelet poor responsiveness was found in 57% in the chronic clopidogrel therapy group. Compared with clopidogrel-naïve patients, chronic clopidogrel therapy patients were more likely to demonstrate clopidogrel poor responsiveness (66% versus 38%, p = 0.02), to be diabetic (52% versus 33%, p = 0.1) and to have multi-vessel coronary disease (79% versus 55%, p = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients sustaining acute coronary syndrome despite chronic clopidogrel therapy are more likely to exhibit inadequate platelet inhibition with clopidogrel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195504</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>e6a187c2</fingerprint><author><name>Ehud Regev</name></author><updated>1523048400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195504</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ehud Regev, Elad Asher, Paul Fefer, Roy Beigel, Israel Mazin, Shlomi Matetzky, For The Platelets and Thrombosis in Sheba (PLATIS) - Study Group &lt;/p&gt;

The overall survival (OS) of patients with ovarian cancer is poor while epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinico-pathologic characteristics, especially the prognostic factors, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Taiwan. Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p&amp;lt;0.001, p = 0.020, p&amp;lt;0.001, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC. Personalized medicine may be needed for different histological types of EOC because of their different outcomes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194993</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>9df5e11f</fingerprint><author><name>Lin-Chau Chang</name></author><updated>1522098000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194993</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin-Chau Chang, Chih-Fen Huang, Mei-Shu Lai, Li-Jiuan Shen, Fe-Lin Lin Wu, Wen-Fang Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Gari, a fermented and dried semolina made from cassava, is one of the most common foods in West Africa. Recently introduced biofortified yellow cassava containing provitamin A carotenoids could help tackle vitamin A deficiency prevalent in those areas. However there are concerns because of the low retention of carotenoids during gari processing compared to other processes (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. boiling). The aim of the study was to assess the levels of true retention in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;–β-carotene during gari processing and investigate the causes of low retention. Influence of processing step, processor (3 commercial processors) and variety (TMS 01/1371; 01/1368 and 01/1412) were assessed. It was shown that low true retention (46% on average) during gari processing may be explained by not only chemical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to roasting temperature) but also by physical losses (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. due to leaching of carotenoids in discarded liquids): true retention in the liquid lost from grating negatively correlated with true retention retained in the mash (R = -0.914). Moreover, true retention followed the same pattern as lost water at the different processing steps (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. for the commercial processors). Variety had a significant influence on true retention, carotenoid content, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerisation but the processor type had little effect. It is the first time that the importance of physical carotenoid losses was demonstrated during processing of biofortified crops.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194402</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>742e1ead</fingerprint><author><name>Aurélie Bechoff</name></author><updated>1521666000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194402</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aurélie Bechoff, Keith Ian Tomlins, Ugo Chijioke, Paul Ilona, Andrew Westby, Erick Boy&lt;/p&gt;

Aims &lt;p&gt;To explore and document the experiences and values of spouse caregivers of stroke survivors. To gain more in-depth knowledge of how the act of caring and the adaption process affects caregiving spouses.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Phenomenological, qualitative study. This study included spouses of stroke survivors who also served as primary caregivers. Individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic content analysis as proposed by Giorgi. Data was analysed and managed using Atlas-ti (version 7.0). This study was approved by our institution´s Complejo Hospitalario de Caceres Ethics and Research Committee.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Spouse caregivers of stroke survivors undergo a process of disruption in their private lives and relationships, marked by their caregiving duties. The experiences of spouses caring for stroke survivors is condensed into topics and subtopics: “&lt;i&gt;Caregiving and that´s all”&lt;/i&gt; summarizes the sense of having no life horizons and also caregiver impossibility of moving away from caring role. Otherwise, “&lt;i&gt;Breaking the couple´s life together”&lt;/i&gt; enlightens the further consequences of stroke in couples shared live biography, which needs to be understood and rebuilt. Finally, “&lt;i&gt;Going through the (non) loss alone”&lt;/i&gt; alludes to how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any acquired global disability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on transition care. Care resources must be adapted to the interpretation that the spouses have of their caregiving role and their relationship with the different components of the caregiving process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195190</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>3070cae8</fingerprint><author><name>Fidel López-Espuela</name></author><updated>1522875600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195190</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fidel López-Espuela, Teresa González-Gil, Javier Amarilla-Donoso, Sergio Cordovilla-Guardia, Juan Carlos Portilla-Cuenca, Ignacio Casado-Naranjo&lt;/p&gt;

Individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic content analysis as proposed by Giorgi. Data was analysed and managed using Atlas-ti (version 7.0). This study was approved by our institution´s Complejo Hospitalario de Caceres Ethics and Research Committee.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Spouse caregivers of stroke survivors undergo a process of disruption in their private lives and relationships, marked by their caregiving duties. The experiences of spouses caring for stroke survivors is condensed into topics and subtopics: “&lt;i&gt;Caregiving and that´s all”&lt;/i&gt; summarizes the sense of having no life horizons and also caregiver impossibility of moving away from caring role. Otherwise, “&lt;i&gt;Breaking the couple´s life together”&lt;/i&gt; enlightens the further consequences of stroke in couples shared live biography, which needs to be understood and rebuilt. Finally, “&lt;i&gt;Going through the (non) loss alone”&lt;/i&gt; alludes to how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any acquired global disability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on transition care. Care resources must be adapted to the interpretation that the spouses have of their caregiving role and their relationship with the different components of the caregiving process.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195190</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1621bbf925f:654116e:9aea0a7d</id><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://www.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 9, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1520389770000</published><title>Connecting thermodynamic and dynamical anomalies of water-like liquid-liquid phase transition in the Fermi–Jagla model</title><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/9&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 9&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>46350a5a</fingerprint><author><name>Saki Higuchi</name></author><link>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017105?af=R</link><originId>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017105?af=R</originId><unread>False</unread><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 9, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1520883962463</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017105?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162aed70588:1c0c090:7c9981b6</id><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>A molecule that manufactures asymmetry</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A molecule that manufactures asymmetry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A molecule that manufactures asymmetry, Published online: 10 April 2018;

Lozano, Carmen Díaz-Batanero, Antonio J. Rojas, Angelina Pilatti, Fermín Fernández-Calderón&lt;/p&gt;
The UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (with five dimensions of impulsive behaviour) is being widely used. One of the handicaps of this instrument is its relatively long administration time. This has led to the development of a short version: SUPPS-P. There are no studies comparing the relationship between the SUPPS-P scores and the original UPPS-P scores. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to analyse the psychometric properties, concordance of person measures, and efficiency of the SUPPS-P compared to those on UPPS-P, applying an Item Response Theory Model. The UPPS-P and SUPPS-P were administered to 455 undergraduate students. Confirmatory factorial analysis replicated structures reported in previous studies: the five correlated factors structure and the model with two second-order factors (Urgency and Lack of Awareness) with Sensation Seeking dimension as a different factor. Rasch analysis show that both of the instruments presented adequate model-data fit. The results show the measurement for each dimension of UPPS-P offered more precision than SUPPS-P. The structure of items location was maintained in each dimension of SUPPS-P compared to the UPPS-P, but with better person and item separation indices of the UPPS-P dimensions. The concordance analysis reveals high correlations values between scores on both versions. From the standpoint of reducing items, it can be considered that the reduced version is more efficient. This study does not support the equivalence of items on the dimensions of Sensation Seeking and Lack of perseverance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194390</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>88d37bb1</fingerprint><author><name>Óscar M.

This has led to the development of a short version: SUPPS-P. There are no studies comparing the relationship between the SUPPS-P scores and the original UPPS-P scores. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to analyse the psychometric properties, concordance of person measures, and efficiency of the SUPPS-P compared to those on UPPS-P, applying an Item Response Theory Model. The UPPS-P and SUPPS-P were administered to 455 undergraduate students. Confirmatory factorial analysis replicated structures reported in previous studies: the five correlated factors structure and the model with two second-order factors (Urgency and Lack of Awareness) with Sensation Seeking dimension as a different factor. Rasch analysis show that both of the instruments presented adequate model-data fit. The results show the measurement for each dimension of UPPS-P offered more precision than SUPPS-P. The structure of items location was maintained in each dimension of SUPPS-P compared to the UPPS-P, but with better person and item separation indices of the UPPS-P dimensions. The concordance analysis reveals high correlations values between scores on both versions. From the standpoint of reducing items, it can be considered that the reduced version is more efficient. This study does not support the equivalence of items on the dimensions of Sensation Seeking and Lack of perseverance.</description><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194390</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a622:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194466</link><published>1521147600000</published><title>Decline in perception of acid regurgitation symptoms from gastroesophageal reflux disease in diabetes mellitus patients</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kosuke Sakitani, Nobumi Suzuki, Sozaburo Ihara, Yoshihiro Hirata, Shoji Kawazu, Yasuhiko Iwamoto, Kazuhiko Koike&lt;/p&gt;
Objectives &lt;p&gt;To determine if a discrepancy exists between subjective symptoms and the grade of endoscopic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;All 2,884 patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy completed the modified Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), an interview-based rating scale consisting of 16 items including a question on acid regurgitation. Patients were divided into DM and non-DM groups (1,135 and 1,749 patients, respectively). GERD was diagnosed endoscopically and graded according to the Los Angeles classification. Grade B or more severe GERD was defined as severe endoscopic GERD. The intergroup GSRS score was compared statistically.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In severe endoscopic GERD patients, the prevalence of patients with a positive GSRS score in the acid regurgitation question was statistically lower in DM patients than non-DM patients. Of the 60 non-DM patients with severe endoscopic GERD, 40 patients (67%) had a positive GSRS score for acid regurgitation; however, of the 51 DM patients with severe endoscopic GERD, 23 patients (45%) had a positive GSRS score. Multivariate analysis showed that severe endoscopic GERD (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.21–3.33; p = 0.0066), non-DM (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.54–0.94; p = 0.0157), younger age (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97–0.99; p = 0.0125), and hiatal hernia (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.12–1.90; p = 0.0042) were associated with acid regurgitation symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a discrepancy between subjective symptoms and endoscopic GERD grade in DM patients.

However, existing approaches require a large number of plasma samples from healthy individuals, sequenced using the same platform and protocols to act as a reference panel. Obtaining this reference panel can be challenging, prohibitively expensive and limits the ability to migrate to improved sequencing platforms and improved protocols. Methods: We developed qCNV and sCNA-seq, two distinct tools that together provide a new approach for profiling somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) through the analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) without a reference panel. Our approach was designed to identify sCNA from cfDNA through the analysis of a single plasma sample and a matched normal DNA sample - both of which can be obtained from the same blood draw. qCNV is an efficient method for extracting read-depth from BAM files and sCNA-seq is a method that uses a probabilistic model of read depth to infer the copy number segmentation of the tumour. We compared the results from our pipeline to the established copy number profile of a cell-line, as well as the results from the plasma-Seq analysis of cfDNA-like mixtures and real, clinical data-sets. Results: With a single, unmatched, germline reference sample, our pipeline recapitulated the known copy number profile of a cell-line and demonstrated similar results to those obtained from plasma-Seq. With less than 1X genome coverage, our approach identified clinically relevant sCNA in samples with as little as 20 % tumour DNA. When applied to plasma samples from cancer patients, our pipeline identified clinically significant mutations. Conclusions: These results show it is possible to identify therapeutically-relevant copy number mutations from plasma samples without the need to generate a reference panel from a large number of healthy individuals.

Objectives and methods &lt;p&gt;Using a randomized, crossover, counterbalanced approach, cyclists (N = 20, overnight fasted state) engaged in the four 75-km time trials (2-week washout) while ingesting two types of bananas with similar carbohydrate (CHO) but different phenolic content (Cavendish, CAV; mini-yellow, MIY, 63% higher polyphenols), a 6% sugar beverage (SUG), and water only (WAT). CHO intake was set at 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes. Blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Each of the CHO trials (CAV, MIY, SUG) compared to water was associated with higher post-exercise plasma glucose and fructose, and lower leukocyte counts, plasma 9+13 HODES, and IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra. OPLS-DA analysis showed that metabolic perturbation (N = 1,605 metabolites) for WAT (86.8±4.0 arbitrary units) was significantly greater and sustained than for CAV (70.4±3.9, P = 0.006), MIY (68.3±4.0, P = 0.002), and SUG (68.1±4.2, P = 0.002). VIP ranking (&amp;lt;3.0, N = 25 metabolites) showed that both CAV and MIY were associated with significant fold changes in metabolites including those from amino acid and xenobiotics pathways. OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts showed a significant separation of CAV and MIY from both WAT and SUG (R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409). COX-2 mRNA expression was lower in both CAV and MIY, but not SUG, versus WAT at 21-h post-exercise in THP-1 monocytes cultured in plasma samples. Analysis of immediate post-exercise samples showed a decrease in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocyte extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in CAV and MIY, but not SUG, compared to WAT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CHO ingestion from bananas or a sugar beverage had a comparable influence in attenuating metabolic perturbation and inflammation following 75-km cycling.

Tildesley, Peter Brommesson, Colleen T. Webb, Uno Wennergren, Matt J. Keeling, Tom Lindström&lt;/p&gt;
Numerical models for simulating outbreaks of infectious diseases are powerful tools for informing surveillance and control strategy decisions. However, large-scale spatially explicit models can be limited by the amount of computational resources they require, which poses a problem when multiple scenarios need to be explored to provide policy recommendations. We introduce an easily implemented method that can reduce computation time in a standard Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model without introducing any further approximations or truncations. It is based on a hierarchical infection process that operates on entire groups of spatially related nodes (cells in a grid) in order to efficiently filter out large volumes of susceptible nodes that would otherwise have required expensive calculations. After the filtering of the cells, only a subset of the nodes that were originally at risk are then evaluated for actual infection. The increase in efficiency is sensitive to the exact configuration of the grid, and we describe a simple method to find an estimate of the optimal configuration of a given landscape as well as a method to partition the landscape into a grid configuration. To investigate its efficiency, we compare the introduced methods to other algorithms and evaluate computation time, focusing on simulated outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) on the farm population of the USA, the UK and Sweden, as well as on three randomly generated populations with varying degree of clustering. The introduced method provided up to 500 times faster calculations than pairwise computation, and consistently performed as well or better than other available methods. This enables large scale, spatially explicit simulations such as for the entire continental USA without sacrificing realism or predictive power.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Oiar5aQKyTU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1523036524528</recrawled><crawled>1523036372641</crawled><updated>1523048400000</updated><fingerprint>35396e1d</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006086</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006086</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Sellman, Kimberly Tsao, Michael J.

Most Chinese lithic industries dated between 300,000 and 40,000 are characterized by the absence of Levallois debitage, the persistence of core-and-flake knapping, the rarity of prepared cores, their reduction with direct hard hammer percussion, and the rarity of retouched flakes. Here we report the discovery of seven bone soft hammers at the early hominin Lingjing site (Xuchang County, Henan) dated to 125,000–105,000. These artefacts represent the first instance of the use of bone as raw material to modify stone tools found at an East Asian early Late Pleistocene site. Three types of soft hammers are identified. The first consists of large bone flakes resulting from butchery of large herbivores that were utilized as such for expedient stone tools retouching or resharpening. The second involved the fracture of weathered bone from medium size herbivores to obtain elongated splinters shaped by percussion into sub-rectangular artefacts. Traces observed on these objects indicate intensive and possibly recurrent utilization, which implies their curation over time. The last consists of antler, occasionally used. Lingjing bone tools complement what we know about archaic hominin cultural adaptations in East Asia and highlight behavioural consistencies that could not be inferred from other cultural proxies. This discovery provides a new dimension to the debate surrounding the existence of the Middle Palaeolithic in the region. The attribution of East Asian sites to the Middle Palaeolithic assumes that cultural traits such as the Levallois method represent evolutionary hallmarks applicable to regions of the world different from those in which they were originally found. Here, we promote an approach that consists in identifying, possibly from different categories of material culture, the original features of each regional cultural trajectory and understanding the behavioural and cognitive implications they may have had for past hominin populations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194318</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>31cd62f3</fingerprint><author><name>Luc Doyon</name></author><updated>1520888400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194318</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luc Doyon, Zhanyang Li, Hao Li, Francesco d’Errico&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to concentrate immunostimulatory compounds at the site of disease can overcome local immune tolerance and reduce systemic toxicity. Surgical resection of tumors may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy by removing the concentrated immunosuppressive microenvironment; however, it also removes tumor-specific leukocytes as well as tumor antigens that may be important to establishing antitumor immunity. Moreover, surgery produces a transient immunosuppressive state associated with wound healing that has been correlated with increased metastasis. Using multiple models of spontaneous metastasis, we show that extended release of agonists of innate immunity—including agonists of Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) or stimulator of interferon genes (STING)—from a biodegradable hydrogel placed in the tumor resection site cured a much higher percentage of animals than systemic or local administration of the same therapy in solution. Depletion and neutralization experiments confirmed that the observed prevention of local tumor recurrence and eradication of existing metastases require both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.

These findings provide new mechanistic understanding of the immune pathways and cells necessary for HBV immunity and identify potential therapeutic targets for resolving CHB.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1521656248775</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/433/eaah5766?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1623d579f75:24a07a8:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y</link><published>1521442800000</published><title>Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of Plutella xylostella, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium Enterococcus mundtii</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &amp;lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&amp;lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &amp;lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23329-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/CeZyQEHdPDo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bc94a10a</fingerprint><author><name>Wenhong Li</name></author><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &amp;lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&amp;lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &amp;lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23329-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/CeZyQEHdPDo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1521447575413</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/CeZyQEHdPDo/s41598-018-23329-y</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_1624f80d71e:667be5:bdf8aaf1</id><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00169/20180322/images/medium/bi-2018-00169w_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00169&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

This study explores the association between specific insomnia symptoms (sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakenings symptoms) and self-efficacy (perceived self-confidence in the ability to use CPAP) with CPAP compliance in French patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of CPAP compliance in a cohort of 404 patients diagnosed with OSAS. Patients completed mailed questionnaires on sleepiness (ESS), insomnia (ISI) and self-efficacy in sleep apnea (SEMSA). Linear regression modeling analyses were performed to explore the impact of measured variables on the number of hours of CPAP use. Of the initial pool of 404 patients, 288 returned the questionnaires (71% response rate). Their mean age was 63.16±12.73 yrs, 31% were females, mean BMI was 30.39±6.31 kg/m2, mean daily CPAP use was 6.19±2.03 h, mean number of years of use was 6.58±6.03 yrs, and mean initial AHI before CPAP use was 34.61±20.71 /h. Age (p&amp;lt;0.01), BMI (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep onset insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep maintenance insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01) and self-efficacy (p&amp;lt;0.01) were significantly associated with mean daily CPAP use.

Adherent cells sense the physical properties of their environment via focal adhesions. Improved understanding of how cells sense and response to their physical surroundings is aided by quantitative evaluation of focal adhesion size, number, orientation, and distribution in conjunction with the morphology of single cells and the corresponding nuclei. We developed a fast, user-friendly and automated image analysis algorithm capable of capturing and characterizing these individual components with a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the algorithm by quantifying morphological changes in response to a variety of environmental changes as well as manipulations of cellular components of mechanotransductions. Finally, as a proof-of-concept we use our algorithm to quantify the effect of Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632 on focal adhesion maturation.

We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of combined use of salivary gland ultrasonography (US) and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatic Disease (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for improving the diagnostic efficiency in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). A US-based salivary gland disease grading system was developed using a cohort comprising 213 SS or non-SS patients who fulfilled the minimum requirements for classifying SS based on the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria. Using 62 SS or non-SS patients from the 213 patients and who had also undergone all the 5 examinations needed for the ACR/EULAR classification, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications for diagnosing SS, using the clinical diagnosis of SS by rheumatologists as the gold standard. The ACR/EULAR criteria discriminated clinical SS patients with 77% and 79% accuracy for those with primary or secondary SS and for those with primary SS, respectively. However, the integrated score system of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications yielded 92% and 93% accuracy for these 2 SS patient groups, respectively, provided that US score of 3 was assigned to patients with US grade ≥2, and then patients with integrated threshold score of ≥5 were diagnosed as SS. Cross-validation also indicated improved accuracy of the integrated ACR/EULAR and US score system (91.9 and 93.0% for primary/secondary and primary SS patients, respectively) over that by the ACR/EULAR criteria alone. (74.2 and 86.0%, respectively). The integrated ACR/EULAR and US scoring system can improve the diagnosis of patients with clinical SS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195113</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>5914b6d6</fingerprint><author><name>Yukinori Takagi</name></author><updated>1522789200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195113</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yukinori Takagi, Hideki Nakamura, Misa Sumi, Toshimasa Shimizu, Yasuko Hirai, Yoshiro Horai, Ayuko Takatani, Atsushi Kawakami, Sato Eida, Miho Sasaki, Takashi Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that can generate energy for cells or clear misfolded or aggregated proteins, and upregulating this process has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe a novel set of LC3B-II and p62 time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assays that can detect changes in autophagy in the absence of exogenous labels. Lipidated LC3 is a marker of autophagosomes, while p62 is a substrate of autophagy. These assays can be employed in high-throughput screens to identify novel autophagy upregulators, and can measure autophagy changes in cultured cells or tissues after genetic or pharmacological interventions. We also demonstrate that different cells exhibit varying autophagic responses to pharmacological interventions. Overall, it is clear that a battery of readouts is required to make conclusions about changes in autophagy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194423</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>88f4d77a</fingerprint><author><name>Alberto Bresciani</name></author><updated>1521493200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194423</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alberto Bresciani, Maria Carolina Spiezia, Roberto Boggio, Cristina Cariulo, Anja Nordheim, Roberta Altobelli, Kirsten Kuhlbrodt, Celia Dominguez, Ignacio Munoz-Sanjuan, John Wityak, Valentina Fodale, Deanna M.

Body size governs predator-prey interactions, which in turn structure populations, communities, and food webs. Understanding predator-prey size relationships is valuable from a theoretical perspective, in basic research, and for management applications. However, predator-prey size data are limited and costly to acquire. We quantified predator-prey total length and mass relationships for several freshwater piscivorous taxa: crappie (&lt;i&gt;Pomoxis&lt;/i&gt; spp.), largemouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus salmoides&lt;/i&gt;), muskellunge (&lt;i&gt;Esox masquinongy&lt;/i&gt;), northern pike (&lt;i&gt;Esox lucius&lt;/i&gt;), rock bass (&lt;i&gt;Ambloplites rupestris&lt;/i&gt;), smallmouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus dolomieu&lt;/i&gt;), and walleye (&lt;i&gt;Sander vitreus&lt;/i&gt;). The range of prey total lengths increased with predator total length. The median and maximum ingested prey total length varied with predator taxon and length, but generally ranged from 10–20% and 32–46% of predator total length, respectively. Predators tended to consume larger fusiform prey than laterally compressed prey. With the exception of large muskellunge, predators most commonly consumed prey between 16 and 73 mm. A sensitivity analysis indicated estimates can be very accurate at sample sizes greater than 1,000 diet items and fairly accurate at sample sizes greater than 100. However, sample sizes less than 50 should be evaluated with caution. Furthermore, median log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; predator-prey body mass ratios ranged from 1.9–2.5, nearly 50% lower than values previously reported for freshwater fishes. Managers, researchers, and modelers could use our findings as a tool for numerous predator-prey evaluations from stocking size optimization to individual-based bioenergetics analyses identifying prey size structure. To this end, we have developed a web-based user interface to maximize the utility of our models that can be found at www.LakeEcologyLab.org/pred_prey.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194092</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>b2ec324c</fingerprint><author><name>Jereme W.

The goal of this study was to objectively assess the effect of a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivate in English bulldogs with stifle degenerative joint disease secondary to cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR). We used a force platform and affixed electrogoniometers to measure peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), stance time (ST), and angular range of motion (AROM), from 12 lame client-owned English bulldogs with post-CCLR stifle joint abnormalities. The 12 affected subjects were treated with 4 intra-articular injections of PRP, at 30-day intervals. Ten untreated, sound English bulldogs were used as a reference group. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using a linear mixed effects model. Mean values of PVF, VI, ST, and AROM were improved within the first 3 months post-treatment in the CCLR group, with mean measured changes increasing to maximum 4.56% body weight gain, 1.5% body weight/second, 0.07 seconds, and 6.18 degrees, respectively. The effects declined progressively after the treatment interval, ending at nearly initial levels after 6 months. This study demonstrates that dogs with CCLR treated with intra-articular PRP had improved PVF, VI, ST, and AROM over time; the duration of effect was waning by the end of the post-treatment period.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194752</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>8ba76de2</fingerprint><author><name>José M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50). LF/HF did not differ between groups. Levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were associated with several HRV parameters, as well as Time from diagnosis of T2DM&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;T2DM was associated with an overall decrease in the HRV of T2DM patients.

We investigated the effect of auditory noise added to speech on patterns of looking at faces in 40 toddlers. We hypothesised that noise would increase the difficulty of processing speech, making children allocate more attention to the mouth of the speaker to gain visual speech cues from mouth movements. We also hypothesised that this shift would cause a decrease in fixation time to the eyes, potentially decreasing the ability to monitor gaze. We found that adding noise increased the number of fixations to the mouth area, at the price of a decreased number of fixations to the eyes. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a mouth-eyes trade-off between attention allocated to social cues coming from the eyes and linguistic cues coming from the mouth. We also found that children with higher word recognition proficiency and higher average pupil response had an increased likelihood of fixating the mouth, compared to the eyes and the rest of the screen, indicating stronger motivation to decode the speech.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194491</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>4ebc6b18</fingerprint><author><name>Magdalena Ewa Król</name></author><updated>1521579600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194491</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena Ewa Król&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Spreadsheet software is increasingly used to implement systems science models informing health policy decisions, both in academia and in practice where technical capacity may be limited. However, spreadsheet models are prone to unintentional errors that may not always be identified using standard error-checking techniques. Our objective was to illustrate, through a methodologic case study analysis, the impact of unintentional errors on model projections by implementing parallel model versions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We leveraged a real-world need to revise an existing spreadsheet model designed to inform HIV policy. We developed three parallel versions of a previously validated spreadsheet-based model; versions differed by the spreadsheet cell-referencing approach (named single cells; column/row references; named matrices). For each version, we implemented three model revisions (re-entry into care; guideline-concordant treatment initiation; immediate treatment initiation). After standard error-checking, we identified unintentional errors by comparing model output across the three versions. Concordant model output across all versions was considered error-free. We calculated the impact of unintentional errors as the percentage difference in model projections between model versions with and without unintentional errors, using +/-5% difference to define a material error.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified 58 original and 4,331 propagated unintentional errors across all model versions and revisions. Over 40% (24/58) of original unintentional errors occurred in the column/row reference model version; most (23/24) were due to incorrect cell references. Overall, &gt;20% of model spreadsheet cells had material unintentional errors. When examining error impact along the HIV care continuum, the percentage difference between versions with and without unintentional errors ranged from +3% to +16% (named single cells), +26% to +76% (column/row reference), and 0% (named matrices).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Standard error-checking techniques may not identify all errors in spreadsheet-based models.

According to advancements in the wireless technologies, study of biometrics-based multi-server authenticated key agreement schemes has acquired a lot of momentum. Recently, Wang et al. presented a three-factor authentication protocol with key agreement and claimed that their scheme was resistant to several prominent attacks. Unfortunately, this paper indicates that their protocol is still vulnerable to the user impersonation attack, privileged insider attack and server spoofing attack. Furthermore, their protocol cannot provide the perfect forward secrecy. As a remedy of these aforementioned problems, we propose a biometrics-based authentication and key agreement scheme for multi-server environments. Compared with various related schemes, our protocol achieves the stronger security and provides more functionality properties. Besides, the proposed protocol shows the satisfactory performances in respect of storage requirement, communication overhead and computational cost. Thus, our protocol is suitable for expert systems and other multi-server architectures. Consequently, the proposed protocol is more appropriate in the distributed networks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194093</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>45f33048</fingerprint><author><name>Li Yang</name></author><updated>1520974800000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194093</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Li Yang, Zhiming Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Anthocyanins are naturally active substances. In this study, anthocyanins from black rice were obtained by membrane filtration and column chromatography separation. Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, not only the pH of the media containing C3G was lower than that of the extract of black rice anthocyanin (BRAE), but the numbers of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were also significantly increased. Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.

Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.</description><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195754</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_1624967d1f7:357bcc:76251cdd</id><origin><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00125/20180321/images/medium/jm-2018-00125z_0013.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00125&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

To move a hard table together, humans may coordinate by following the dominant partner’s motion [1–4], but this strategy is unsuitable for a soft mattress where the perceived forces are small. How do partners readily coordinate in such differing interaction dynamics? To address this, we investigated how pairs tracked a target using flexion-extension of their wrists, which were coupled by a hard, medium or soft virtual elastic band. Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, who had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled partner’s muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one’s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information. This model elucidates the versatile mechanism by which humans can coordinate during both hard and soft physical interactions to ensure maximum performance with minimal effort.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bXD1PWYahz8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1521750245762</recrawled><crawled>1521740722341</crawled><updated>1521752400000</updated><fingerprint>42fe5b05</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005971</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005971</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atsushi Takagi, Francesco Usai, Gowrishankar Ganesh, Vittorio Sanguineti, Etienne Burdet&lt;/p&gt;

The dietary intake was assessed by using the three-day dietary questionnaire, and a 24-hour dietary recall, clinical and biochemical data were also evaluated. The MetS was diagnosed by the Harmonized Metabolic Syndrome criteria. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was to depict the optimal cut-off value of EI for the diagnosis of MetS. The logistic regression was also used to explore the association between inadequate EI and MetS. The optimal cut-off points of EI for identifying the MetS were 26.7 kcal/kg/day for patients aged less than 60 years, or with non-diabetes, and 26.2 kcal/kg/day for patients aged 60 years and above, or with diabetes, respectively. The likelihood of the MetS increased with lower percentiles of energy intake in hemodialysis patients.

Recent vaccine studies with experimental antigens have shown that regulatory T cells (Tregs) constrain the magnitude of B cell responses. This homeostatic Treg-mediated suppression is thought to reduce the potential of germinal center (GC) responses to generate autoreactive antibodies. However, essentially opposite results were observed in live influenza infections where Tregs promoted B cell and antibody responses. Thus, it remains unclear whether Tregs dampen or enhance B cell responses, especially during live viral infections. Here, we use mice infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), which induces a robust expansion of Tregs. Depletion of Tregs led to elevated activation, proliferation, and class switching of B cells. In addition, Treg depletion enhanced the production of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies and reduced FV viremia. Thus, in contrast to influenza infection, Tregs either directly or indirectly suppress B cells during mouse retroviral infection indicating that the ultimate effect of Tregs on B cell responses is specific to the particular infectious agent.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195402</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>a8213765</fingerprint><author><name>Tyler C.

Understanding how neurons cooperate to integrate sensory inputs and guide behavior is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction (HD) system, we present evidence demonstrating how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised Machine Learning tool, can learn the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. We show how the method, unlike linear analysis, reveals that the coordination in thalamo-cortical circuits is qualitatively the same during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine Learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eLys5LrtLXM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1521750245762</recrawled><crawled>1521740722341</crawled><updated>1521752400000</updated><fingerprint>9b8ac515</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006041</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006041</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Viejo, Thomas Cortier, Adrien Peyrache&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The impact of obesity on survival is known to vary in different cancers. Advanced biliary tract cancer was rarely analyzed about the relationship between obesity and prognosis. We performed this study to evaluate the BMI and body weight change as prognostic factors for advanced biliary tract cancer patients with palliative chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between January 2005 and December 2016, two hundred and seventy-six patients who underwent chemotherapy for biliary tract cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The relationship between BMI (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and clinical outcomes including overall and progression-free survival was assessed. Additionally the relationship between change in body composition and overall survival was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Median overall survival was 9.7 months for underweight patients, 10.1 months for normal patients, 15.8 months for overweight group, 13.1 months for obese patients, respectively. (p = 0.047) Univariate analysis showed that BMI, stage III, age less than 64 year-old, gallbladder cancer, operation, radiotherapy and ECOG performance were significantly associated with better survival. Compared with normal patients, overweight patients (BMI 23–24.9kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) had a reduced risk of mortality in multivariate analysis (HR 0.632; 95% CI 0.436–0.918, p = 0.016). In the additional analysis for the effect of changes in body weight and BMI to the overall survival, decrease in body weight and BMI (HR 1.410, 95% CI 1.168–1.986, p = 0.046) was associated with a shorter in overall survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Overweight status and the maintenance of body weight during the initial period of chemotherapy are important and independent predictors of better overall survival in advanced biliary tract cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195118</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>fbc1694c</fingerprint><author><name>Jinwoo Kang</name></author><updated>1522702800000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195118</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinwoo Kang, Sang Hyub Lee, Jun Hyuk Son, Jae Woo Lee, Young Hoon Choi, Jin Ho Choi, Woo Hyun Paik, Ji Kon Ryu, Yong-Tae Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194203</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>d51c9d5f</fingerprint><author><name>Nicole C.

Jegerlehner, Adam D. Brown, Aristomenis K. Exadaktylos, David S. Srivastava&lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Negative workplace behaviour, especially negative communication is a recognised problem in many organisations and is known to have serious impact on workplace performance, productivity and personal wellbeing. Emergency Departments (ED) can be high stress environments in which communication and perceptions of respect between physicians and other staff may underlie individual functioning. We conducted a study to estimate the influence of incivility (ICV) among physicians in the ED.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed an online survey to assess workplace incivility in the ED. We focussed on frequency, origin, reasons and situations where ICV was reported. To measure the levels and the potential influence of ICV on psychological safety, social stress and personal wellbeing we correlated our questionnaire to standard psychological scales. Statistical analysis included Students t-test, chi squared distribution and Pearson correlation coefficient.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We invited all seventy-seven ED physicians to participate in our survey. Among those that completed (n = 50, 65%) the survey, 9% of ED physicians reported frequent (1/week) and 38% occasional (1/month) incidents of ICV. 28% of physicians reported experiencing ICV once per quarter and 21% reported a frequency of only once per year, no physician reported ICV on a daily basis. Levels of ICV were significantly higher in interactions with specialists from outside then within the ED (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).ICV was perceived particularly during critical situations. Our findings showed a significant correlation between internal (within the ED team) ICV and psychological safety. To ED physicians internal ICV was associated with lower levels of psychological safety (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). ICV displayed from sources outside the ED team was not associated with psychological safety, but we found a significant influence of external ICV on personal irritability and reduced wellbeing (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of incivility was high among the ED physicians. Although this was a small sample, the association between workplace ICV and psychological safety, personal irritation as well personal comfort suggests that ICV may be an important variable underlying ED team performance.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Negative workplace behaviour, especially negative communication is a recognised problem in many organisations and is known to have serious impact on workplace performance, productivity and personal wellbeing. Emergency Departments (ED) can be high stress environments in which communication and perceptions of respect between physicians and other staff may underlie individual functioning. We conducted a study to estimate the influence of incivility (ICV) among physicians in the ED.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed an online survey to assess workplace incivility in the ED. We focussed on frequency, origin, reasons and situations where ICV was reported. To measure the levels and the potential influence of ICV on psychological safety, social stress and personal wellbeing we correlated our questionnaire to standard psychological scales. Statistical analysis included Students t-test, chi squared distribution and Pearson correlation coefficient.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We invited all seventy-seven ED physicians to participate in our survey. Among those that completed (n = 50, 65%) the survey, 9% of ED physicians reported frequent (1/week) and 38% occasional (1/month) incidents of ICV. 28% of physicians reported experiencing ICV once per quarter and 21% reported a frequency of only once per year, no physician reported ICV on a daily basis. Levels of ICV were significantly higher in interactions with specialists from outside then within the ED (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).ICV was perceived particularly during critical situations. Our findings showed a significant correlation between internal (within the ED team) ICV and psychological safety. To ED physicians internal ICV was associated with lower levels of psychological safety (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). ICV displayed from sources outside the ED team was not associated with psychological safety, but we found a significant influence of external ICV on personal irritability and reduced wellbeing (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of incivility was high among the ED physicians. Although this was a small sample, the association between workplace ICV and psychological safety, personal irritation as well personal comfort suggests that ICV may be an important variable underlying ED team performance. These findings further underscore the need to foster a culture of respect and good communication between departments, as levels of ICV were highest with physicians from outside the ED. Future research would benefit from examining strategies to prevent and reduce ICV and identify reasons for personal variation in perception of ICV. During critical situations and in general collaboration with specialists, awareness of ICV and countermeasures are important to avoid decreased performance and negative impact on staff and patient.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194933</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162480a98d2:3522cfa:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><published>1521615600000</published><title>A global observatory for gene editing</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A global observatory for gene editing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A global observatory for gene editing, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03270-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03270-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sheila Jasanoff and J.

Westerlund, Lucie Delemotte&lt;/p&gt;
Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling pathways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1522787045837</recrawled><crawled>1522777258471</crawled><updated>1522789200000</updated><fingerprint>2a2f00b</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006072</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006072</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Annie M.

The anatomical location of adipose tissue might have direct implications for its functionality and risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. To determine the expression of genes related to energy expenditure and the levels of some adipokines, histological examinations, quantitative PCR, and protein expression measurements in adipocyte precursor cells were performed. Periaortic adipocytes were smaller than those from subcutaneous tissue. Moreover, weight gain induced periaortic adipocyte hypertrophy (r = -0.91, p&amp;lt;0.01). Compared to subcutaneous tissue, adiponectin, FABP4, IL-4 and IL-6 was decreased in periaortic adipocytes, whereas FGF21, UCP-1, PGC-1a, CITED1, Omentin and TFAM (Mitochondrial protein) increased. Upon analyzing patients’ clinical conditions, it emerged that the levels of PGC-1a both in male (r = -0.48 p&amp;lt;0.04) and female (r = -0.61, p&amp;lt;0.05) and TFAM in male (r = -0.72, p&amp;lt;0.0008) and female (r = -0.86, p&amp;lt;0.002) decreased significantly with progressive weight gain. However, no differences were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus 2 or Hyperlipidemia.

This allows more efficiency in computationally intensive tasks such as larger scale data analysis and bootstrapping. The canonical search phase iteratively finds a pair of connected components that minimizes a distance function in {Theta}(n^3) time in the input taxa count. A relaxed search strategy has been implemented that has average-case time complexity of O(n^2logn) but with {Theta}(n^3) worst-case time complexity. This search strategy sacrifices some accuracy for speed. The original approach&apos;s implementation has been improved by using good programming practice. These improvements increased run-time performance by a constant factor of approximately 2 and reduced memory requirements by a constant factor of approximately 6. These search strategies allow multithreading to better use modern CPU hardware. PFAM data of 2000--30,000 taxa were used for testing performance.

This allows more efficiency in computationally intensive tasks such as larger scale data analysis and bootstrapping. The canonical search phase iteratively finds a pair of connected components that minimizes a distance function in {Theta}(n^3) time in the input taxa count. A relaxed search strategy has been implemented that has average-case time complexity of O(n^2logn) but with {Theta}(n^3) worst-case time complexity. This search strategy sacrifices some accuracy for speed. The original approach&apos;s implementation has been improved by using good programming practice. These improvements increased run-time performance by a constant factor of approximately 2 and reduced memory requirements by a constant factor of approximately 6. These search strategies allow multithreading to better use modern CPU hardware. PFAM data of 2000--30,000 taxa were used for testing performance. The canonical implementation with three threads improved average performance by approximately 2.1. The relaxed search has good quality, and the accuracy was tested on a mammal and a eukaryote data set. Kendall tau distance was used as a rough measure of topological similarity for the relaxed and canonical search strategies.</description><crawled>1521231123249</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283424v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16296ec676f:a39a996:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1522911600000</published><title>Cross-type Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Deep Multi-Task Learning [NEW RESULTS]</title><content><content>Motivation: Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) is the most fundamental task in biomedical text mining.

Understanding maternity roost requirements is fundamental to guide timber production forest management given such roosts are vital to sustain bat populations.

We aimed to investigate interspecific maternity roost selection in a regenerating landscape and by doing so, increase our understanding of the three species’ roost ecology.

With vaccination development being promoted by emerging innovations of the digital age, vaccinating a patient with individual tumor mutations may become the first truly personalized treatment for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><engagement>21</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1355?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1622099e6cb:661313:34f43e70</id><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1520961998000</published><title>Strong control of Southern Ocean cloud reflectivity by ice-nucleating particles [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences]</title><content><content>Large biases in climate model simulations of cloud radiative properties over the Southern Ocean cause large errors in modeled sea surface temperatures, atmospheric circulation, and climate sensitivity.

Genetic differences contribute to variations in the immune response mounted by different individuals to a pathogen. Such differential response can influence the spread of infectious disease, indicating why such diseases impact some populations more than others. Here, we study the impact of population-level genetic heterogeneity on the epidemic spread of different strains of H1N1 influenza. For a population with known HLA class-I allele frequency and for a given H1N1 viral strain, we classify individuals into sub-populations according to their level of susceptibility to infection. Our core hypothesis is that the susceptibility of a given individual to a disease such as H1N1 influenza is inversely proportional to the number of high affinity viral epitopes the individual can present. This number can be extracted from the HLA genetic profile of the individual. We use ethnicity-specific HLA class-I allele frequency data, together with genome sequences of various H1N1 viral strains, to obtain susceptibility sub-populations for 61 ethnicities and 81 viral strains isolated in 2009, as well as 85 strains isolated in other years. We incorporate these data into a multi-compartment SIR model to analyse the epidemic dynamics for these (ethnicity, viral strain) epidemic pairs. Our results show that HLA allele profiles which lead to a large spread in individual susceptibility values can act as a protective barrier against the spread of influenza. We predict that populations skewed such that a small number of highly susceptible individuals coexist with a large number of less susceptible ones, should exhibit smaller outbreaks than populations with the same average susceptibility but distributed more uniformly across individuals. Our model tracks some well-known qualitative trends of influenza spread worldwide, suggesting that HLA genetic diversity plays a crucial role in determining the spreading potential of different influenza viral strains across populations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x5hYH_0EN7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1521663840899</recrawled><crawled>1521654476064</crawled><updated>1521666000000</updated><fingerprint>f8123518</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006069</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006069</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Narmada Sambaturu, Sumanta Mukherjee, Martín López-García, Carmen Molina-París, Gautam I.

In applications of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in clinical psychiatry settings in Japan, a phonemic verbal fluency test (VFT) that includes “switching” (the ability to shift efficiently to a new word subcategory) to assess phonemic fluency is employed to capture disease-specific hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, to extend the specific features of this test, the VFT was repeated to examine an activation change in NIRS measurements in 20 healthy males. Without task performance change, the hemodynamic activation induced by the VFT was significantly attenuated in the left PFC through repetition of the task. These findings suggest that the left PFC is involved in processing of the VFT. Further, it may be possible to extend the current VFT using this repetition to provide a more sensitive examination of the left PFC, whose dysfunction has been reported in several psychiatric diseases such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193994</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>e56ec173</fingerprint><author><name>Yoshihiro Kawakubo</name></author><updated>1521666000000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193994</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshihiro Kawakubo, Masaya Yanagi, Noa Tsujii, Osamu Shirakawa&lt;/p&gt;

Humans employ various control strategies to initiate and maintain bodily movement. In case that the normal gait function is impaired, exoskeleton robots provide motor assistance during therapy. While the robotic control system builds on kinematic gait functions, the patient’s voluntary efforts to initiate motion also contribute to the effectiveness of the therapy process. However, it is currently not well understood how voluntary initiation as a subjective capacity affects the physiological level of motor control. In order to understand the functional nexus between voluntary initiation and motor control, we interviewed patients undergoing robotic gait rehabilitation with the HAL exoskeleton robot about their experience and command of voluntarily initiating forward gait while using the HAL system. Their reports provide phenomenal evidence for voluntary initiation as a distinct cognitive act that comes as phenomenal performance. Furthermore, phenomenal evidence about the functional relation of intention and initiation correlates with FIM-M gait scores.

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury still represents a major concern in clinical transplantation, especially in the era of extreme organ shortage and extended criteria donor organs. In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240–340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;RIC 1 group showed significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>968614f6</fingerprint><author><name>Zoltan Czigany</name></author><updated>1522875600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zoltan Czigany, Christian Bleilevens, Christian Beckers, Christian Stoppe, Michaela Möhring, Andras Fülöp, Attila Szijarto, Georg Lurje, Ulf P.

Global introductions of aquatic species and their associated pathogens are threatening worldwide biodiversity. The introduction of two North American crayfish species, &lt;i&gt;Procambarus clarkii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pacifastacus leniusculus&lt;/i&gt;, into Japan in 1927 seems to have negatively affected native Japanese crayfish populations of &lt;i&gt;Cambaroides japonicus&lt;/i&gt;. Several studies have shown the decline of these native populations due to competition, predation and habitat colonization by the two invasive North American crayfish species. Here, we identify an additional factor contributing to this decline. We report the first crayfish plague outbreaks in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonicus&lt;/i&gt; populations in Japan, which were diagnosed using both histological and molecular approaches (analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region). Subsequent analyses of the mitochondrial ribosomal rnnS and rnnL regions of diseased specimens indicate that these outbreaks originated from a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt; population and identify a novel haplotype of &lt;i&gt;Aphanomyces astaci&lt;/i&gt;, d3-haplotype, hosted by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;clarkii&lt;/i&gt;.

The current study aimed to assess the potential of different exercises triggering an osteogenic response at the femoral neck in a group of postmenopausal women. The osteogenic potential was determined by ranking the peak hip contact forces (HCFs) and consequent peak tensile and compressive strains at the superior and inferior part of the femoral neck during activities such as (fast) walking, running and resistance training exercises. Results indicate that fast walking (5–6 km/h) running and hopping induced significantly higher strains at the femoral neck than walking at 4 km/h which is considered a baseline exercise for bone preservation. Exercises with a high fracture risk such as hopping, need to be considered carefully especially in a frail elderly population and may therefore not be suitable as a training exercise. Since superior femoral neck frailness is related to elevated hip fracture risk, exercises such as fast walking (above 5 km/h) and running can be highly recommended to stimulate this particular area. Our results suggest that a training program including fast walking (above 5 km/h) and running exercises may increase or preserve the bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195463</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>19023cab</fingerprint><author><name>Pim Pellikaan</name></author><updated>1522875600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195463</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pim Pellikaan, Georgios Giarmatzis, Jos Vander Sloten, Sabine Verschueren, Ilse Jonkers&lt;/p&gt;

Our results suggest that a training program including fast walking (above 5 km/h) and running exercises may increase or preserve the bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck.</description><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195463</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1621bbf925f:654114f:9aea0a7d</id><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://www.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 9, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1519885226000</published><title>An infrared spectroscopic study on proton transfer from CH bonds in ionized dimers of cyclic ethers</title><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/9&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 9&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8e10ba54</fingerprint><author><name>Min Xie</name></author><link>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018639?af=R</link><originId>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018639?af=R</originId><unread>False</unread><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 9, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1520883962463</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018639?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162a9b5209a:142c877:7c9981b6</id><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24022-w</link><published>1523257200000</published><title>Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plac1 Is a Key Regulator of the Inflammatory Response and Immune Tolerance In Mammary Tumorigenesis, Published online: 09 April 2018;

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41–50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51–67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195346</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>bbb665c1</fingerprint><author><name>Tadeja Kuret</name></author><updated>1522875600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195346</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tadeja Kuret, Katja Lakota, Polonca Mali, Saša Čučnik, Sonja Praprotnik, Matija Tomšič, Snezna Sodin-Semrl&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Qualitative studies indicated that cancer survivors may be worried about finding a partner in the future, but whether this concern is warranted is unknown. We examined single people´s interest in dating a cancer survivor, how they perceive survivors’ traits, and their preferences about the timing of disclosing a cancer history.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In three experimental vignette studies, dating website members (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 324) and college students (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 138 and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 131) were randomly assigned to a vignette of a person with or without a history of cancer (experiment 1 &amp;amp; 2), or a cancer survivor beyond or during active follow-up (experiment 3). Respondents rated their interest in dating this fictive person, this person’s traits, and indicated their preferences about the timing of disclosure. ANOVAs with main and interaction effects of condition, gender, and relationship history were conducted, partial eta squared and Cohen’s &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; were used to estimate the magnitude of effects. Correlations were used to investigate relationships between interest in a date and assessment of traits.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors’ traits were assessed more positively, but interest to date them did not differ from healthy vignettes for both men and women. However, widowed respondents were much less interested in a date with a cancer survivor, and women showed less interest in a cancer survivor during active follow-up relative to survivors beyond follow-up. Most respondents wanted to hear about the cancer diagnosis after a few dates, hardly anyone wanted to hear about this before the first date (2% - 5%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion and implications for cancer survivors &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors do not have to expect any more problems in finding a date than people without a cancer history, and can wait a few dates before disclosing.

Survivors dating widowed people and survivors in active follow-up could expect more hesitant reactions and should disclose earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194277</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1628cac297a:9554b85:34f43e70</id><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1522774666000</published><title>Xio is a component of the Drosophila sex determination pathway and RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase complex [Genetics]</title><content><content>N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant chemical modification in eukaryotic mRNA, has been implicated in Drosophila sex determination by modifying Sex-lethal (Sxl) pre-mRNA and facilitating its alternative splicing.

Cell signaling is the process by which extracellular information is transmitted into the cell to perform useful biological functions. The ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) signaling controls several cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The ERK signaling pathway considered in this work starts with an extracellular stimulus and ends with activated (double phosphorylated) ERK which gets translocated into the nucleus. We model and analyze this complex pathway by decomposing it into three functional subsystems. The first subsystem spans the initial part of the pathway from the extracellular growth factor to the formation of the SOS complex, ShC-Grb2-SOS. The second subsystem includes the activation of Ras which is mediated by the SOS complex. This is followed by the MAPK subsystem (or the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) which produces the double phosphorylated ERK upon being activated by Ras. Although separate models exist in the literature at the subsystems level, a comprehensive model for the complete system including the important regulatory feedback loops is missing. Our dynamic model combines the existing subsystem models and studies their steady-state and dynamic interactions under feedback. We establish conditions under which bistability and oscillations exist for this important pathway. In particular, we show how the negative and positive feedback loops affect the dynamic characteristics that determine the cellular outcome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195513</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>cc10a330</fingerprint><author><name>Yaman Arkun</name></author><updated>1523307600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195513</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yaman Arkun, Mohammadreza Yasemi&lt;/p&gt;

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a key regulator of brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis. The PPARγ gene produces two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. PPARγ2 is identical to PPARγ1 except for additional 30 amino acids present in the N-terminus of PPARγ2. Here we report that the C-terminally truncated form of PPARγ2 is predominantly present in the mitochondrial matrix of brown adipocytes and that it binds to the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which contains the promoter for mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) genes. Expression of mitochondrially targeted MLS-PPARγ2 in brown adipocytes increases mtDNA-encoded ETC gene expression concomitant with enhanced mitochondrial respiration. These results suggest that direct regulation of mitochondrially encoded ETC gene expression by mitochondrial PPARγ2, in part, underlies the isoform-specific role for PPARγ2 in brown adipocytes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195007</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>226260be</fingerprint><author><name>Ji Suk Chang</name></author><updated>1521752400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195007</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Suk Chang, Kyoungsoo Ha&lt;/p&gt;

P5B ATPases are present in the genomes of diverse unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, indicating that they have an ancient origin, and that they are important for cellular fitness. Inactivation of ATP13A2, one of the four human P5B ATPases, leads to early-onset Parkinson’s disease (Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome). The presence of an invariant PPALP motif within the putative substrate interaction pocket of transmembrane segment M4 suggests that all P5B ATPases might have similar transport specificity; however, the identity of the transport substrate(s) remains unknown. Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis possess three paralogous P5B ATPase genes, &lt;i&gt;catp-5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;catp-6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-7&lt;/i&gt;, which probably originated from a single ancestral gene around the time of origin of the Caenorhabditid clade. By using CRISPR/Cas9, we have systematically investigated the expression patterns, subcellular localization and biological functions of each of the P5B ATPases of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We find that each gene has a unique expression pattern, and that some tissues express more than one P5B. In some tissues where their expression patterns overlap, different P5Bs are targeted to different subcellular compartments (e.g., early endosomes vs. plasma membrane), whereas in other tissues they localize to the same compartment (plasma membrane). We observed lysosomal co-localization between CATP-6::GFP and LMP-1::RFP in transgenic animals; however, this was an artifact of the tagged LMP-1 protein, since anti-LMP-1 antibody staining of native protein revealed that LMP-1 and CATP-6::GFP occupy different compartments. The nematode P5Bs are at least partially redundant, since we observed synthetic sterility in &lt;i&gt;catp-5(0); catp-6(0)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-6(0) catp-7(0)&lt;/i&gt; double mutants. The double mutants exhibit defects in distal tip cell migration that resemble those of &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt; (alpha integrin ortholog) and &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; (Pax6 ortholog) mutants, suggesting that the nematode P5Bs are required for &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt;and/or &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; function.

We show that this method is able to solve a range of synthetic and experimental data sets, where the underlying structure is known, and identifies consistent and meaningful clusters in new behavioral data.</description><crawled>1520886327704</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/224840v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_16255667e0c:5a4015:bdf8aaf1</id><origin><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01812/20180323/images/medium/jm-2017-01812t_0012.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01812&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Currently, only local signals arising from the bone marrow niche have been shown to maintain HSCs. However, it is not known whether systemic factors also sustain HSCs. We assessed the physiological source of thrombopoietin (TPO), a key cytokine required for maintaining HSCs. Using &lt;i&gt;Tpo&lt;sup&gt;DsRed-CreER&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; knock-in mice, we showed that TPO is expressed by hepatocytes but not by bone marrow cells. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tpo&lt;/i&gt; from hematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, or bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells does not affect HSC number or function.

Currently, only local signals arising from the bone marrow niche have been shown to maintain HSCs. However, it is not known whether systemic factors also sustain HSCs. We assessed the physiological source of thrombopoietin (TPO), a key cytokine required for maintaining HSCs. Using &lt;i&gt;Tpo&lt;sup&gt;DsRed-CreER&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; knock-in mice, we showed that TPO is expressed by hepatocytes but not by bone marrow cells. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tpo&lt;/i&gt; from hematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, or bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells does not affect HSC number or function. However, when &lt;i&gt;Tpo&lt;/i&gt; is deleted from hepatocytes, bone marrow HSCs are depleted. Thus, a cross-organ factor, circulating TPO made in the liver by hepatocytes, is required for bone marrow HSC maintenance.

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1522095842894</recrawled><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><updated>1522098000000</updated><fingerprint>f0df1a15</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

During online speech processing, our brain tracks the acoustic fluctuations in speech at different timescales. Previous research has focused on generic timescales (for example, delta or theta bands) that are assumed to map onto linguistic features such as prosody or syllables. However, given the high intersubject variability in speaking patterns, such a generic association between the timescales of brain activity and speech properties can be ambiguous. Here, we analyse speech tracking in source-localised magnetoencephalographic data by directly focusing on timescales extracted from statistical regularities in our speech material. This revealed widespread significant tracking at the timescales of phrases (0.6–1.3 Hz), words (1.8–3 Hz), syllables (2.8–4.8 Hz), and phonemes (8–12.4 Hz). Importantly, when examining its perceptual relevance, we found stronger tracking for correctly comprehended trials in the left premotor (PM) cortex at the phrasal scale as well as in left middle temporal cortex at the word scale. Control analyses using generic bands confirmed that these effects were specific to the speech regularities in our stimuli. Furthermore, we found that the phase at the phrasal timescale coupled to power at beta frequency (13–30 Hz) in motor areas. This cross-frequency coupling presumably reflects top-down temporal prediction in ongoing speech perception. Together, our results reveal specific functional and perceptually relevant roles of distinct tracking and cross-frequency processes along the auditory–motor pathway.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3m9xJbh7ayE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1520877724139</recrawled><crawled>1520876632612</crawled><updated>1520888400000</updated><fingerprint>bb53183c</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004473</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004473</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne Keitel, Joachim Gross, Christoph Kayser&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of those questions that improves on further inspection – or deteriorates, according to your point of view, because it just keeps on getting more complicated. For decades, there was no good answer at all, but then there was “It reduces signaling in the inflammation pathways”, followed by “OK, it seems to do that by decreasing this prostaglandin signaling molecule” and “Ah, it does that by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, a key enzyme in the pathway to make those”. Then we moved to “Hold it, there’s more than one cyclooxygenase”, which is how we ended up with the COX-2 inhibitors like Vioxx, which led to “You know, the functions of these two are more complicated than we even thought”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on top of all these, there are clearly effects of NSAID drugs that have nothing to do with the COX enzymes at all. Blood clotting you can pretty much chalk up to the COX isoforms, but there are more things going on, and they’re very poorly defined. Which brings up a more general question: how do you ever know about all the things that a small-molecule drug might be doing in a living system? The answer is, you don’t. That’s not generally appreciated outside the biomedical professions, but it’s the truth. We don’t have some way to track things around and watch them interact at a molecule level through out a cell or an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. Mapping compound-protein interactions is a big part of chemical biology, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b11639&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Woo lab at Harvard shows an attempt to track small molecules in just this way. It uses photoaffinity labeling, via the now-nearly-standard combination tag of a diazirine and an acetylene, which lets you form a covalent bond to (most) of the thing the molecule of interest is spending time next to, and on the back end of the process, it uses isotope-labeled tags on the acetylene-click-conjugation step to give the mass spec detection a much higher signal/noise. Just digging through the whole cellular proteome without the kind of validation that isotope tagging gives you is a tall order, but the deliberately-weird-mass-combination effect of the stable isotope tags moves things up out of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three NSAIDs are given the treatment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen&quot;&gt;naproxen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib&quot;&gt;celecoxib&lt;/a&gt; (Celebrex), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin&quot;&gt;indomethacin&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a good spread of activity: naproxen hits both COX-1 and COX-2 pretty much equally, celecoxib is of course a COX-2 selective compound, and indomethacin is in a structurally distinct class that’s already known to have some other modes of action. &lt;em&gt;(Update:&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja408322b&quot;&gt; here’s work&lt;/a&gt; from another group on an alkyne-tagged aspirin derivative, which also interacts with a long list of cellular proteins).&lt;/em&gt; All the photolabel-derivatized compounds were still active against COX enzymes (albeit with somewhat lower affinity), and all of them could be displaced by the parent compounds in competition assays. All of them photo-labeled COX-2 in an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiment, as they certainly should, and this experiment was used to validate the mass spec analysis methods for the whole-cell experiments. (For example, each of these compounds produces six or seven different photoadducts, depending on which nearby amino acid gets snagged by the reactive carbene that forms from the diazirene, and the group was able to see and account for all of these without difficulty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens in cells? They tried the dosing/photolabeling experiment in Jurkat cells, along with experiments with photoactive negative control (non-NSAID) compounds. About 700 proteins were labeled in all, with quite a bit of overlap between the three NSAIDs (40% of them are hit by all three), and that figure alone should make a person stop and think a bit: &lt;em&gt;as simple and widely used a molecule as naproxen binds to hundreds of proteins well enough to photolabel them&lt;/em&gt;. No, we don’t know the details of what’s going on in there, do we? Admittedly, that’s at a high concentration (250 micromolar), but (1) patients take whopping doses of this stuff in the real world, and (2) the majority of these interactions also showed up at a 50 micromolar dose as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same set of experiments was also run in K562 cells, a leukemia line. In this case, there were 513 enriched protein targets and &lt;em&gt;only 206 of them overlapped&lt;/em&gt; with the set from the Jurkat cells. And that’s also something to think about – not only do small, well-known compounds like these interact with a long list of proteins, that list can change dramatically in different cell backgrounds. Only about 30% of the total list of proteins have ever been report to interact with any small molecules at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of these doesn’t show any particular compartmentalization effects in the cells; it pretty much tracks protein abundance across the cytoplasm, various organelles, nucleus and so on. A closer look at the proteins and their interaction sites can be found in the paper, but one thing worth mentioning is a “hot spot” in histone H2A, which is certainly not a target that anyone had been thinking about for NSAIDs, to my knowledge. Assigning all the specific sites of labeling across the proteome is still beyond current technology, although you can think of some experiments that would help narrow things down a lot (different protein digestion before the mass spec, and so on). But even at this level – which is more detailed than we’ve ever had for such compounds – there’s a lot to deal with here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you needed a reminder about just what a complicated mixing bowl we’re throwing our compounds into, here you go. The hope is that such techniques and the ungodly huge piles of data that they generate will help up build up a clearer picture of drug action. But what a picture that’s going to be!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><keywords><item>Chemical Biology</item></keywords><recrawled>1522404216849</recrawled><crawled>1521211929387</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/16/more-proteins-than-you-ever-thought</canonicalUrl><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13335</link><fingerprint>94f2e936</fingerprint><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13335</originId><unread>True</unread><description>When you take an NSAID (naproxen, ibuprofen, aspirin, etc.), how does it work?

Furthermore, expression of a subset of genes could predict disease development before other host-based indications of infection such as fever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1522260627358</crawled><engagement>10</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/434/eaaq1016?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1621bbf925f:6541150:9aea0a7d</id><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://www.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 9, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1519885228000</published><title>Hydration dynamics of a lipid membrane: Hydrogen bond networks and lipid-lipid associations</title><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/9&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 9&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>487e4118</fingerprint><author><name>Abhinav Srivastava</name></author><link>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011803?af=R</link><originId>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011803?af=R</originId><unread>False</unread><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 9, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1520883962463</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5011803?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162308dc6cb:1583832:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1521183600000</published><title>An Algorithmic Information Calculus for Causal Discovery and Reprogramming Systems [NEW RESULTS]</title><content><content>We introduce a conceptual framework and an interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the algorithmic contribution of each of the systems elements to the whole by exploiting principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic randomness.

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing.

Our Adolescent SRH Stigma Scale comprised 20 items and 3 sub-scales (Internalized, Enacted, Lay Attitudes) to measure stigma occurring with sexual activity, contraceptive use, pregnancy, abortion and family planning service use. We assessed relationships between a comprehensive set of demographic, health and social factors and SRH Stigma with multi-level multivariable linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In unadjusted bivariate analyses, compared to their counterparts, SRH stigma scores were higher among girls who were younger, Accra residents, Muslim, still in/dropped out of secondary school, unemployed, reporting excellent/very good health, not in a relationship, not sexually experienced, never received family planning services, never used contraception, but had been pregnant (all p-values &amp;lt;0.05). In multivariable models, higher SRH stigma scores were associated with history of pregnancy (β = 1.53, CI = 0.51,2.56) and excellent/very good self-rated health (β = 0.89, CI = 0.20,1.58), while lower stigma scores were associated with older age (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.24,-0.09), higher educational attainment (β = -1.22, CI = -1.82,-0.63), and sexual intercourse experience (β = -1.32, CI = -2.10,-0.55).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings provide insight into factors contributing to SRH stigma among this young Ghanaian female sample.

&lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of &lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt;, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coluzzii&lt;/i&gt; independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily. Overall, this exploratory study provides valuable indications of spatial and seasonal differences in bacterial composition which help refine this difficult to study state.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194899</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>a174f829</fingerprint><author><name>Benjamin J.

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, an increasing popularity of marathons has been seen. Although running has been shown to have considerable positive health effects, the risk of sudden death, most often due to sudden cardiac arrests, is also a risk runners expose themselves to. Whilst there are some studies on the mortality amongst long-distance runners, much of the evidence is dated. Given the increased popularity in running during the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century as well as the improvements in medical care at marathons, more knowledge is required on the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and method &lt;p&gt;Publicly available racing and news databases were used to identify the number of entrants and finishers in half to full marathons in Sweden between 2007 and 2016 and the number of deaths that occurred in conjunction with the races.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,156,271 runners entered a long distance (21-42km) running race in Sweden between 2007 and 2016, and 834,412 runners finished the races (72.2%). A large majority of the finishers (677,050 (81%)) competed in distances under a full marathon. Two deaths occurred during the time period, meaning that the death rate was 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.04–0.79) per 100,000 finishers.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study can show that death rates in long distance running races between 2007 and 2016 in Sweden are very low, compared to previous studies. When added to the existing literature, the combined picture suggests a general downward trend in the risk of death during marathons since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195626</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>7183bd96</fingerprint><author><name>Finn Nilson</name></author><updated>1523307600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195626</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Finn Nilson, Mats Börjesson&lt;/p&gt;

Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1PcJThDi81k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1522787045837</recrawled><crawled>1522777258471</crawled><updated>1522789200000</updated><fingerprint>7e9d9ffd</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006065</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006065</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hironori Fujita, Masayoshi Kawaguchi&lt;/p&gt;

Supplying food for the anticipated global population of over 9 billion in 2050 under changing climate conditions is one of the major challenges of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Agricultural expansion and intensification contributes to global environmental change and risks the long-term sustainability of the planet. It has been proposed that no more than 15% of the global ice-free land surface should be converted to cropland. Bioenergy production for land-based climate mitigation places additional pressure on limited land resources. Here we test normative targets of food supply and bioenergy production within the cropland planetary boundary using a global land-use model. The results suggest supplying the global population with adequate food is possible without cropland expansion exceeding the planetary boundary. Yet this requires an increase in food production, especially in developing countries, as well as a decrease in global crop yield gaps. However, under current assumptions of future food requirements, it was not possible to also produce significant amounts of first generation bioenergy without cropland expansion. These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194695</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>2f96cfa1</fingerprint><author><name>R.

Heneghan, Richard Smith, Isaak Tyros, Deborah Falla, Alison Rushton&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Research investigating Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) has largely focused on the cervical spine yet symptoms can be widespread. Thoracic spine pain prevalence is reported ~66%; perhaps unsurprising given the forceful stretch/eccentric loading of posterior structures of the spine, and the thoracic spine’s contribution to neck mobility/function. Approximately 50% WAD patients develop chronic pain and disability resulting in high levels of societal and healthcare costs. It is time to look beyond the cervical spine to fully understand anatomical dysfunction in WAD and provide new directions for clinical practice and research.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the scope and nature of dysfunction in the thoracic region in patients with WAD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review and data synthesis was conducted according to a pre-defined, registered (PROSPERO, CRD42015026983) and published protocol. All forms of observational study were included. A sensitive topic-based search strategy was designed from inception to 1/06/16. Databases, grey literature and registers were searched using a study population terms and key words derived from scoping search. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third reviewer checked for consistency and clarity. Extracted data included summary data: sample size and characteristics, outcomes, and timescales to reflect disorder state. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were tabulated to allow enabling a semi-qualitative comparison and grouped by outcome across studies. Strength of the overall body of evidence was assessed using a modified GRADE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty eight studies (n&gt;50,000) which were conducted across a range of countries were included. Few authors responded to requests for further data (5 of 9 contacted). Results were reported in the context of overall quality and were presented for measures of pain or dysfunction and presented, where possible, according to WAD severity and time point post injury. Key findings include: 1) high prevalence of thoracic pain (&gt;60%); higher for those with more severe presentations and in the acute stage, 2) low prevalence of chest pain (&amp;lt;22%), 3) evidence of thoracic outlet syndrome, with some association to and involvement of the brachial plexus, 4) muscle dysfunction in the form of heightened activity of the sternocleidomastoid or delayed onset of action of the serratus anterior, 5) high prevalence of myofascial pain and trigger points in the scalene muscles, sternocleidomastoid and mid/lower fibres of trapezius muscle (48–65%), and 6) inconclusive evidence of altered thoracic posture or mobility.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence supports thoracic pain and dysfunction in patients with WAD, involving primarily nerves and muscles. Notwithstanding the low/very low level of evidence from this review, our findings do support a more extensive clinical evaluation of patients presenting with WAD. Additional high quality research is required to further characterise dysfunction across other structures in the thoracic region, including but not limited to the thoracic spine (mobility and posture) and thoracic muscles (stiffness, activation patterns). In turn this may inform the design of clinical trials targeting such dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194235</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>9195ced1</fingerprint><author><name>Nicola R.

Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical features of postoperative delirium are similar to the core features of alpha synuclein-related cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which precede the cardinal motor features of PD, are likely to be risk factors for developing postoperative delirium. We investigated the association between PD-related NMSs and postoperative delirium in old people undergoing elective spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective study. Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis. We assessed eight easily-assessed and representative PD-related NMSs 1 day before the scheduled surgery using tests or questionnaires for each symptom. The presence of delirium was determined by using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Fifteen (14.4%) of the 104 participants (age, 71.7 ± 4.7 years; men, 34.6%) met the CAM criteria for post-operative delirium. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that decreased olfactory function (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.44–0.91) and exhibiting rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD, OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09–1.93) were significantly independent predictors of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study shows that hyposmia and RBD are significantly independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in general elderly population. Considering that NMSs may represent burden of alpha synuclein deposit, we postulate that an underlying alpha synucleinopathy may correlates with postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Significance &lt;p&gt;This study gives a novel insight for the risk factor of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195749</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>217a9dd7</fingerprint><author><name>Ki Hoon Kim</name></author><updated>1523307600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195749</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ki Hoon Kim, Suk Yun Kang, Dong Ah Shin, Seong Yi, Yoon Ha, Keung Nyun Kim, Young Ho Sohn, Phil Hyu Lee&lt;/p&gt;

The Florida manatee (&lt;i&gt;Trichechus manatus latirotris&lt;/i&gt;) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three G-tetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195625</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>e617e4f8</fingerprint><author><name>Maryam Zahin</name></author><updated>1523307600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195625</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maryam Zahin, William L.

Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease. We conducted a scoping review of child growth studies in which length/height, weight or body mass index (BMI) was measured at ≥ 2 time points. From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., ‘weight gain’) and a ‘content signature’, a numeric code that summarized the metric’s conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child’s change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels.

It makes sense – if you want things to react, getting all the partners dissolved in some medium where they can roam around and contact each other is surely the way to go, most of the time. But it’s also true that we don’t really have a good grasp of what’s happening in solution at the molecular level. Solvation shells, nanoscale aggregates and clusters, effects of interfacial regions: the idealized picture of things floating around is complicated by a lot of real-world effects, which can be very important. They’re particularly so when it comes to dissolution and its opposite, precipitation and crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the formation of microcrystals. I know that I had a mental picture of these that is probably incorrect. As I imagined it, all sorts of nucleation events happened in solution but the size of the resulting crystals was constrained (perhaps by amount of available solute, or by effects of stirring) so that they just didn’t grow very large. But in many systems, it appears that what happens first is a liquid-liquid phase separation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;sound familiar?&lt;/a&gt;), what’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition&quot;&gt;spinodal decomposition&lt;/a&gt; into microscopic solute-rich and solute-poor droplets, and the solute-rich ones then crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201711128&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; provides another example of liquid-phase weirdness. The authors are looking at a very well-known reaction, reduction of a metal salt to the elemental metal. That sentence hides a lot of complications: for example, what form does this metal arrive in? You can get a mirror deposit on the inside wall of the vessel (as with the famous old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent&quot;&gt;Tollens reagent&lt;/a&gt; or the other more stable mirror-silvering mixtures), but more often you get some sort of fine black powder. Microscopic examination of that, though, reveals a huge range of particle sizes and morphologies depending on conditions, and it’s just those changes that can make a big difference in (for example) catalyst performance. Finely divided high-surface-area metals (palladium/platinum on carbon, Raney nickel, Rieke metals) are very important in synthetic chemistry, and their properties vary tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work provides an ingenious variation. The authors take an aqueous solution of the metal salt (silver nitrate in the first example), freeze it in liquid nitrogen, and then let this ice chunk slowly dissolve in a cold solution of the reducing agent (sodium borohydride). That gives, under the right conditions, essentially an atom-by-atom release of silver ions into the solution, and what you get out is atomically dispersed metal. By electron microscopy, the great bulk of the material is produced as what are apparently single silver atoms, not clusters, aggregates, etc. (there’s also further characterization by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_X-ray_absorption_fine_structure&quot;&gt;EXAFS&lt;/a&gt;). I’m surprised that it doesn’t form those on standing, but as I said before, there are a lot of things about the solution phase that my mental models don’t handle well. The authors believe (on the basis of modeling calculations) that the solvation shell around the single metal atoms is a barrier to forming such nanoparticles, and that the release of individual metal atoms is thus key to the whole process. Dimers of silver atoms and the like seem to be just fine in aqueous solution if they can form (or if they’re whittled down to that size); this synthesis just doesn’t let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates the same sort of chemistry with a whole list of metals – platinum, palladium, cobalt, nickel, copper, iridium, gold and more. It certainly seems to be a general process, and the resulting atomically dispersed metals would, you’d have to imagine, be very active catalysts in further reactions. What’s more, this entire method would seem to have applications in many other reactions, too, where the slow release of one reactant into an excess of another is important. I’m actually kicking myself not to have thought of something like this – in hindsight it seems like a perfectly simple idea, but try coming up with these in the forward direction!&lt;/p&gt;

Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters inside a living cell will lead to major advances in our understanding of biology and complex diseases, such as cancer. It also enables the development of new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Progress in nanofabrication and wireless communication has opened up the potential of making a wireless chip small enough that it can be wholly inserted into a living cell. To investigate how such chips could be internalized into various types of living single cells and how this process might affect cells’ physiology, we designed and fabricated a series of multilayered micron-scale tag structures with different sizes as potential RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cell trackers. While the present structures are test structures that do not resonate, the tags that do resonate have similar structure from device fabrication, material properties, and device size point of view. The structures are in four different sizes, the largest with the lateral dimension of 9 μm × 21 μm. The thickness for these structures is kept constant at 1.5 μm. We demonstrate successful delivery of our fabricated chips into various types of living cells, such as melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and healthy/normal fibroblast skin cells. To our surprise, we observed a remarkable internalization rate difference between each cell type; the uptake rate was faster for more aggressive cancer cells than the normal/healthy cells. Cell viability before and after tag cellular internalization and persistence of the internalized tags have also been recorded over the course of five days of incubation. These results establish the foundations of the possibility of long term, wireless, intracellular physiological signal monitoring.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194712</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>34706f2b</fingerprint><author><name>Kokab B.

The electrical conductivity was not enhanced by intentional doping, and thin films of this material showed high optical transparency.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><engagement>22</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1391?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a2:9aea0a7d</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195743</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Increasing prevalence, molecular characterization and antifungal drug susceptibility of serial &amp;lt;i&gt;Candida auris&amp;lt;/i&gt; isolates in Kuwait</title><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ziauddin Khan, Suhail Ahmad, Noura Al-Sweih, Leena Joseph, Wadha Alfouzan, Mohammad Asadzadeh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging yeast pathogen of global significance. Its multidrug-resistant nature and inadequacies of conventional identification systems pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This study investigated occurrence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in clinical specimens in Kuwait and its susceptibility to antifungal agents. Clinical yeast strains isolated during 3.5-year period and forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida were studied by wet mount examination for microscopic morphology and Vitek 2 yeast identification system. A simple species-specific PCR assay was developed for molecular identification and results were confirmed by PCR-sequencing of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing of one isolate from each patient was determined by Etest. The 280 isolates forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida, were identified by Vitek 2 as &lt;i&gt;Candida haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 166), &lt;i&gt;Candida utilis&lt;/i&gt; (n = 49), &lt;i&gt;Candida kefyr&lt;/i&gt; (n = 45), &lt;i&gt;Candida guilliermondii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 9), &lt;i&gt;Candida famata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida conglobata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 5).

MacDonald, Sarawut Jitrapakdee&lt;/p&gt;
Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) plays an essential role in gluconeogenesis. Here we report that the human FBP1 gene is regulated by two liver-enriched transcription factors, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. C/EBPα regulates transcription of FBP1 gene via binding to the two overlapping C/EBPα sites located at nucleotide -228/-208 while HNF4α regulates FBP1 gene through binding to the classical H4-SBM site and direct repeat 3 (DR3) located at nucleotides -566/-554 and -212/-198, respectively. Mutations of these transcription factor binding sites result in marked decrease of C/EBPα- or HNF4α-mediated transcription activation of FBP1 promoter-luciferase reporter expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of -228/-208 C/EBPα or -566/-554 and -212/-198 HNF4α sites with nuclear extract of HepG2 cells overexpressing C/EBPα or HNF4α confirms binding of these two transcription factors to these sites. Finally, we showed that siRNA-mediated suppression of C/EBPα or HNF4α expression in HepG2 cells lowers expression of FBP1 in parallel with down-regulation of expression of other gluconeogenic enzymes. Our results suggest that an overall gluconeogenic program is regulated by these two transcription factors, enabling transcription to occur in a liver-specific manner.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194252</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>163651e1</fingerprint><author><name>Siriluck Wattanavanitchakorn</name></author><updated>1521752400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194252</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siriluck Wattanavanitchakorn, Pinnara Rojvirat, Tanit Chavalit, Michael J.

Network analysis of large metagenomic datasets generated by current sequencing technologies can reveal significant co-occurrence patterns between microbial species of a biological community. These patterns can be analyzed in terms of pairwise combinations between all species comprising a community. Here, we construct a co-occurrence network for abundant microbial species encompassing the three dominant phyla found in human gut. This was followed by an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation of the predicted microbe-microbe co-occurrences, where we chose species pairs &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium adolescentis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Roseburia inulinivorans&lt;/i&gt; as model organisms for our study.

As an intrinsically global effect of protein dynamics, it is difficult to associate protein allostery with individual residues, hindering effective selection of key residues for mutagenesis studies. The machine learning models including decision tree (DT) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were applied to develop classification model for a cell signaling allosteric protein with two states showing extremely similar tertiary structures in both crystallographic structures and molecular dynamics simulations. Both DT and ANN models were developed with 75% and 80% of predicting accuracy, respectively. Good agreement between machine learning models and previous experimental as well as computational studies of the same protein validates this approach as an alternative way to analyze protein dynamics simulations and allostery. In addition, the difference of distributions of key features in two allosteric states also underlies the population shift hypothesis of dynamics‐driven allostery model. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522463421000</published><title>Recognition of protein allosteric states and residues: Machine learning approaches</title><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a2c48469</fingerprint><author><name>HongyuZhou

The machine learning models including decision tree (DT) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were applied to develop classification model for a cell signaling allosteric protein with two states showing extremely similar tertiary structures in both crystallographic structures and molecular dynamics simulations. Both DT and ANN models were developed with 75% and 80% of predicting accuracy, respectively. Good agreement between machine learning models and previous experimental as well as computational studies of the same protein validates this approach as an alternative way to analyze protein dynamics simulations and allostery. In addition, the difference of distributions of key features in two allosteric states also underlies the population shift hypothesis of dynamics‐driven allostery model. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><crawled>1522925554799</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25218?af=R</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162b12a08af:1e3d0:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1523386901000</published><title>Endothelial GqPCR activity controls capillary electrical signaling and brain blood flow through PIP2 depletion [Physiology]</title><content><content>Brain capillaries play a critical role in sensing neural activity and translating it into dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow to serve the metabolic needs of the brain.

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice.

Investigating cerebral metabolism &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; at a microscopic level is essential for understanding brain function and its pathological alterations. The intricate signaling and metabolic dynamics between neurons, glia, and microvasculature requires much more detailed understanding to better comprehend the mechanisms governing brain function and its disease-related changes. We recently demonstrated that pharmacologically-induced alterations to different steps of cerebral metabolism can be distinguished utilizing 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of endogenous reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we evaluate the ability of the phasor analysis method to identify these pharmacological metabolic alterations and compare the method’s performance with more conventional nonlinear curve-fitting analysis. Visualization of phasor data, both at the fundamental laser repetition frequency and its second harmonic, enables resolution of pharmacologically-induced alterations to mitochondrial metabolic processes from baseline cerebral metabolism. Compared to our previous classification models based on nonlinear curve-fitting, phasor–based models required fewer parameters and yielded comparable or improved classification accuracy.

They aim to overcome stochasticity in the selection of precursor ions by utilising (mass-) windowed acquisition that is followed by computational reconstruction of the chromatograms. While DIA methods increasingly outperform typical data-dependent methods in identification consistency and precision specifically on large sample series, possibilities remain for further improvements. At present, only a fraction of the information recorded in the complex DIA spectra is extracted by the software analysis pipelines.

They aim to overcome stochasticity in the selection of precursor ions by utilising (mass-) windowed acquisition that is followed by computational reconstruction of the chromatograms. While DIA methods increasingly outperform typical data-dependent methods in identification consistency and precision specifically on large sample series, possibilities remain for further improvements. At present, only a fraction of the information recorded in the complex DIA spectra is extracted by the software analysis pipelines. Here we present a software tool (DIA-NN) that introduces artificial neural nets and a new quantification strategy to enhance signal processing in DIA-data. DIA-NN greatly improves identification of precursor ions and, as a consequence, protein quantification accuracy. The performance of DIA-NN demonstrates that deep learning provides opportunities to boost the analysis of data-independent acquisition workflows in proteomics.</description><crawled>1521149903489</crawled><engagement>2</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282699v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162b12a08af:1e3c3:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><published>1523386901000</published><title>Grassland biodiversity can pay [Economic Sciences]</title><content><content>The biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) literature provides strong evidence of the biophysical basis for the potential profitability of greater diversity but does not address questions of optimal management.

Analyzing extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an attractive approach to diagnosis of prostate diagnosis. However, existing methods of EVs isolation have low efficiency, purity, and long process time, and therefore have low diagnostic ability. To solve these the problems, a two-phase system is adapted to isolate EVs from a patient’s urine. Urine from 20 prostate cancer (PCA) patients and 10 benign prostate hyperplasia patients was used to quantify the EVs-isolation ability of an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) and to compare the diagnostic ability of ATPS with that of the conventional diagnosis method. An optimized ATPS isolates EVs with ~100% efficiency within ~30 min, with 14 times as high as achieved by ultracentrifugation. Afterward, PCR and ELISA are used to detect EVs derived from PCA cells in urine. The results demonstrate that diagnostic ability based on ATPS is better than other conventional diagnostic methods. ATPS can obtain a high quality and quantity of EVs from patients’ urine. EVs contain cancer-related protein and genes, so these abundant sources enable diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, ATPS is a useful tool to increase the specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194818</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>43d40a2f</fingerprint><author><name>Hyunwoo Shin</name></author><updated>1522184400000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194818</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunwoo Shin, Yong Hyun Park, Yong-Goo Kim, Ji Youl Lee, Jaesung Park&lt;/p&gt;

Current approaches for DNA extraction and fragmentation from mammalian spermatozoa provide several challenges for the investigation of the oxidative stress burden carried in the genome of male gametes. Indeed, the potential introduction of oxidative DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species, reducing agents (dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol), and DNA shearing techniques used in the preparation of samples for chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing serve to cofound the reliability and accuracy of the results obtained. Here we report optimised methodology that minimises, or completely eliminates, exposure to DNA damaging compounds during extraction and fragmentation procedures. Specifically, we show that Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion prior to cellular lysis generates a greater DNA yield with minimal collateral oxidation while randomly fragmenting the entire paternal genome. This modified methodology represents a significant improvement over traditional fragmentation achieved via sonication in the preparation of genomic DNA from human spermatozoa for downstream applications, such as next-generation sequencing. We also present a redesigned bioinformatic pipeline framework adjusted to correctly analyse this form of data and detect statistically relevant targets of oxidation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195003</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>3c8ddf1a</fingerprint><author><name>Miguel J.

However, continuous-trait probabilistic models, which are key to such comparative analysis, remain under-explored. Here we develop a new model, called phylogenetic hidden Markov Gaussian processes (Phylo-HMGP), to simultaneously infer heterogeneous evolutionary states of functional genomic features in a genome-wide manner. Both simulation studies and real data application demonstrate the effectiveness of Phylo-HMGP.

However, continuous-trait probabilistic models, which are key to such comparative analysis, remain under-explored. Here we develop a new model, called phylogenetic hidden Markov Gaussian processes (Phylo-HMGP), to simultaneously infer heterogeneous evolutionary states of functional genomic features in a genome-wide manner. Both simulation studies and real data application demonstrate the effectiveness of Phylo-HMGP.

The structure and function of clinical dosage insulin and its analogues were assessed.

On ultracentrifugation analysis, the insulins under investigation were found to be in numerous conformational states, however the majority of insulins were present in a primarily hexameric conformation. This was true for all native insulins and two fast-acting analogues. However, glargine was present as a dimer, detemir was a multi-hexameric system, degludec was a dodecamer (di-hexamer) and glulisine was present as a dimer-hexamer-dihexamer system. However, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the two hexameric fast-acting analogues (aspart and lispro) dissociated into monomers and dimers due to the lack of zinc in the mobile phase.

Environmental pathways have, therefore, largely been ignored. Rotavirus, however, persists in water sources, and both its surface water concentrations and infection incidence vary with temperature.

These datasets are typically not independent from each other. For example, methylation may influence gene expression, which may, in turn, influence drug response. Such relationships can strongly affect analyses performed on the data, as we have previously shown for the identification of biomarkers of drug response. Therefore, it is important to be able to chart the relationships between datasets. We present iTOP, a methodology to infer a topology of relationships between datasets. We base this methodology on the RV coefficient, a measure of matrix correlation, which can be used to determine how much information is shared between two datasets. We extended the RV coefficient for partial matrix correlations, which allows the use of graph reconstruction algorithms, such as the PC algorithm, to infer the topologies. In addition, since multi-omics data often contain binary data (e.g. mutations), we also extended the RV coefficient for binary data. Applying iTOP to pharmacogenomics data, we found that gene expression acts as a mediator between most other datasets and drug response: only proteomics clearly shares information with drug response that is not present in gene expression. Based on this result, we used TANDEM, a method for drug response prediction, to identify which variables predictive of drug response were distinct to either gene expression or proteomics.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/03/293993</canonicalUrl><author><name>Aben, N.</name></author><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293993v1?rss=1</link><fingerprint>bbaa1599</fingerprint><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293993v1?rss=1</originId><unread>True</unread><description>In biology, we are often faced with multiple datasets recorded on the same set of objects, such as multi-omics and phenotypic data of the same tumors.

Vocal development is usually studied from the perspective of neuroscience. In this issue, Zhang and Ghazanfar propose a way in which body growth might condition the process. They study the vocalizations of marmoset infants with a wide range of techniques that include computational models and experiments that mimic growth reversal. Their results suggest that the qualitative changes that occur during development are rooted in the nonlinear interaction between the nervous system and the biomechanics involved in respiration. This work illustrates how an integrative approach enriches our understanding of behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zvNFkUWyj-M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><recrawled>1521740766979</recrawled><crawled>1521740694775</crawled><updated>1521752400000</updated><fingerprint>28edc485</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005544</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005544</href></item></canonical><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel B.

This work illustrates how an integrative approach enriches our understanding of behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zvNFkUWyj-M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/zvNFkUWyj-M/article</href></item></alternate><engagement>6</engagement><author><name>Gabriel B.

Insulin is a vital part of diabetes treatment, whereas glucagon is primarily used to treat insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, glucagon is suggested to have a central role in the regulation of body weight, which would be beneficial for diabetic patients. Since the glucagon effect on blood glucose is known to be transient, it is relevant to investigate the pharmacodynamics of glucagon after repeated dosing. In the present study, we used telemetry to continuously measure blood glucose in streptozotocin induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. This allowed for a more detailed analysis of glucose regulation compared to intermittent blood sampling. In particular, we evaluated the blood glucose-lowering effect of different insulin doses alone, and in combination with a long acting glucagon analog (LAG). We showed how the effect of the LAG accumulated and persisted over time. Furthermore, we found that addition of the LAG decreased body weight without affecting food intake.
In a subsequent study, we focused on the glucagon effect on body weight and food intake during equal glycemic control. In order to obtain comparable maximum blood glucose lowering effect to insulin alone, the insulin dose had to be increased four times in combination with 1 nmol/kg of the LAG. In this set-up the LAG prevented further increase in body weight despite the four times higher insulin-dose. However, the body composition was changed. The insulin group increased both lean and fat mass, whereas the group receiving four times insulin in combination with the LAG only significantly increased the fat mass. No differences were observed in food intake, suggesting a direct effect on energy expenditure by glucagon. Surprisingly, we observed decreased levels of FGF21 in plasma compared to insulin treatment alone. With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>7444c4b7</fingerprint><author><name>Christina Pedersen</name></author><updated>1521579600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christina Pedersen, Trine Porsgaard, Maria Thomsen, Mette Marie Rosenkilde, Nikolaj Kulahin Roed&lt;/p&gt;

No differences were observed in food intake, suggesting a direct effect on energy expenditure by glucagon. Surprisingly, we observed decreased levels of FGF21 in plasma compared to insulin treatment alone. With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</description><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f62:34f43e70</id><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Context matters (but how and why?)

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>47fe2690</fingerprint><author><name>Maria Paola Bertone</name></author><updated>1522789200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Paola Bertone, Jean-Benoît Falisse, Giuliano Russo, Sophie Witter&lt;/p&gt;

Strategic purchasing is an essential health financing function. This paper compares the strategic purchasing practices of Thailand’s two tax-financed health insurance schemes, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), and identifies factors contributing to successful universal health coverage outcomes by analysing the relationships between the purchaser and government, providers and members. The study uses a cross-sectional mixed-methods design, including document review and interviews with 56 key informants. The Comptroller General Department (CGD) of Ministry of Finance manages CSMBS as one among civil servant welfare programmes. Their purchasing is passive. Fee for service payment for outpatient care has resulted in rapid cost escalation and overspending of their annual budget. In contrast, National Health Security Office (NHSO) manages purchasing for UCS, which undertakes a range of strategic purchasing actions, including applying closed ended provider payment, promoting primary healthcare’s gate keeping functions, exercising collective purchasing power and engaging views of members in decision making process. This difference in purchasing arrangements resulted in expenditure per CSMBS member being 4 times higher than UCS in 2014. The governance of the purchaser organization, the design of the purchasing arrangements including incentives and use of information, and the institutional capacities to implement purchasing functions are essential for effective strategic purchasing which can improve health system efficiency as a whole.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195179</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>9ee1557c</fingerprint><author><name>Walaiporn Patcharanarumol</name></author><updated>1522702800000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195179</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Walaiporn Patcharanarumol, Warisa Panichkriangkrai, Angkana Sommanuttaweechai, Kara Hanson, Yaowaluk Wanwong, Viroj Tangcharoensathien&lt;/p&gt;

Births outside marriage (BoM) account for around 15% of all births globally. However, the distribution around the world is very uneven, as are cultural and political attitudes towards them. Studies from East Asia have shown that the percentage of such births is very low, with only modest increases in recent years. The orthodox demographic view holds that the maintenance of conservative views around the relationship between marriage and childbearing can play a role in keeping fertility low. Prenuptial pregnancies (PNP) (where births occur within eight months of marriage) have been identified as a growing phenomenon in Japan, possibly being an ‘alternative’ Asian pathway to family formation. As yet, no comprehensive statistical analysis of the trends of BoM or PNP has been performed for Hong Kong. Using a comprehensive microdata set of birth registration in Hong Kong from 1984–2015 (N = 1,680,831) we provide evidence of recent trends in such ‘alternative pathways’ to family formation and examine predictors through regression analysis. Our results indicate, in common with elsewhere in East Asia, low overall period rates of either BoM or PNP (although the latter has risen notably in recent years). While more recent birth cohorts exhibit higher prevalence of such births, their incomplete nature and higher expected propensity suggests that the figures are exaggerated. In our regression analysis, we find that lower educational attainment is a strong predictor of both BoM and PNP, suggesting that a bifurcation of experience may be occurring. This adds further evidence to the theory that the maintenance of traditional family formation systems in the context of revolutionised educational and work opportunities for women mean that the opportunity costs of the ‘marriage package’ become too high. Current disparities in rights and privileges between married and unmarried parents–and especially their children–means that targeted family planning services and support for vulnerable families are policy priorities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>de73defb</fingerprint><author><name>Stuart Gietel-Basten</name></author><updated>1522357200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stuart Gietel-Basten, Georgia Verropoulou&lt;/p&gt;

Recent advances suggest that impairment in social cognition (SC) may play a role in the development of social anxiety (SA). However, very few studies have analyzed whether SA fosters poorer social-cognitive development as it leads to social avoidance. This study aimed to analyze whether retrospectively assessed behavioral inhibition (BI) (i.e., an early form of SA) in childhood is associated with a deficit in social cognition operationalized as impairment of mentalizing (MZ) in adolescence. A sample of 256 adolescents (range: 12–18 years; mean age: 14.7 years; &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 1.7) from general population were assessed for MZ capacities and retrospective BI through self-report and interview measures. Results comparing three groups of adolescents with different levels of childhood BI (low, moderate or high) and controlling for concurrent SA and depression reveal that the higher the level of BI, the lower the level of MZ. These results were consistent for almost all mentalization measures, including when both extreme (i.e., high vs. low BI) and non-extreme (i.e., high vs. moderate BI) were compared in both self-report and interview measures and in both dimensions of MZ (i.e., MZ referred to others’ and to own mental states). These findings support that childhood forms of SA are associated to deficit in SC in adolescence. A possible bi-directional relationship between SA and SC, and the role that it may play in the pathway to clinical SA are discussed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>e784a6d6</fingerprint><author><name>Sergi Ballespí</name></author><updated>1522357200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sergi Ballespí, Ariadna Pérez-Domingo, Jaume Vives, Carla Sharp, Neus Barrantes-Vidal&lt;/p&gt;

As a Java library, it further provides core data structures to the GINsim and EpiLog interactive tools, which supply graphical interfaces and additional analysis methods for cellular and multi-cellular qualitative models.</description><crawled>1522954445300</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/287011v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16262447aac:5a64591:9f3b30f2</id><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>Alternative polyadenylation (APA) regulates mRNA translation, stability, and protein localization.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Although severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis-related diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no reliable biomarker of CAD risks in patients with OSA. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1-Abs) are associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-two adults diagnosed with OSA by polysomnography, 96 patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 64 healthy volunteers (HVs) were consecutively enrolled. Serum samples were collected from patients with OSA at diagnostic polysomnography and from patients with ACS at disease onset. Serum NBL1-Ab level was measured by amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay and its association with clinical variables related to atherosclerosis was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;NBL1-Ab level was significantly elevated in patients with both OSA and ACS compared with HVs. Subgroup analyses showed that NBL1-Ab level was markedly higher in patients with severe OSA and OSA patients with a history of CAD. Weak associations were observed between NBL1-Ab level and apnea-hypopnea index, age, mean SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and arousal index, whereas significantly higher NBL1-Ab levels were observed in OSA patients with a history of CAD than in those without a history of CAD. Sensitivity analysis using a logistic regression model also demonstrated that increased NBL1-Ab levels were associated with the previous history of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Elevated NBL1-Ab levels may be associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA, which needs to be confirmed further.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195015</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>b0341bac</fingerprint><author><name>Takuma Matsumura</name></author><updated>1522357200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195015</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takuma Matsumura, Jiro Terada, Taku Kinoshita, Yoriko Sakurai, Misuzu Yahaba, Kenji Tsushima, Seiichiro Sakao, Kengo Nagashima, Toshinori Ozaki, Yoshio Kobayashi, Takaki Hiwasa, Koichiro Tatsumi&lt;/p&gt;

There is a suspected but unproven association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and subjective stress, depressive disorders, health-related quality of life (QoL) and suicide. We selected 124,205 adults from the Korean Community Health Survey in 2013 who were at least 19 years old and who had lived in their current domiciles for &gt; five years. Based on the computer-assisted personal interviews to measure subjective stress in daily life, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, depression diagnosis by a doctor, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts, we evaluated the risk of mental disorders using multiple logistic regression analysis according to the quartiles of air pollutants, such as particulate matter &amp;lt;10μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, using yearly average concentration between August 2012 and July 2013. The prevalence of high stress, poor QoL, depressiveness, diagnosis of depression, and suicide ideation was positively associated with high concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO after adjusting for confounding factors. Men were at increased risk of stress, poor QoL, and depressiveness from air pollution exposure than were women. The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects &amp;lt; age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To provide evidence for quantitative magnetic resonance (qMR) biomarkers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy by investigating the relationship between qMR measures of lower extremity muscle pathology and functional endpoints in a large ambulatory cohort using a multicenter study design.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;MR spectroscopy and quantitative imaging were implemented to measure intramuscular fat fraction and the transverse magnetization relaxation time constant (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in lower extremity muscles of 136 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Measures were collected at 554 visits over 48 months at one of three imaging sites.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To provide evidence for quantitative magnetic resonance (qMR) biomarkers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy by investigating the relationship between qMR measures of lower extremity muscle pathology and functional endpoints in a large ambulatory cohort using a multicenter study design.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;MR spectroscopy and quantitative imaging were implemented to measure intramuscular fat fraction and the transverse magnetization relaxation time constant (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in lower extremity muscles of 136 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Measures were collected at 554 visits over 48 months at one of three imaging sites.

Whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects mental functions, and how any such effects arise from its neural effects, continue to be debated. We investigated whether tDCS applied over the visual cortex (Oz) with a vertex (Cz) reference might affect response times (RTs) in a visual search task. We also examined whether any significant tDCS effects would interact with task factors (target presence, discrimination difficulty, and stimulus brightness) that are known to selectively influence one or the other of the two information processing stages posited by current models of visual search. Based on additive factor logic, we expected that the pattern of interactions involving a significant tDCS effect could help us colocalize the tDCS effect to one (or both) of the processing stages. In Experiment 1 (n = 12), anodal tDCS improved RTs significantly; cathodal tDCS produced a nonsignificant trend toward improvement. However, there were no interactions between the anodal tDCS effect and target presence or discrimination difficulty. In Experiment 2 (n = 18), we manipulated stimulus brightness along with target presence and discrimination difficulty. Anodal and cathodal tDCS both produced significant improvements in RTs. Again, the tDCS effects did not interact with any of the task factors. In Experiment 3 (n = 16), electrodes were placed at Cz and on the upper arm, to test for a possible effect of incidental stimulation of the motor regions under Cz. No effect of tDCS on RTs was found. These findings strengthen the case for tDCS having real effects on cerebral information processing. However, these effects did not clearly arise from either of the two processing stages of the visual search process. We suggest that this is because tDCS has a DIFFUSE, pervasive action across the task-relevant neuroanatomical region(s), not a discrete effect in terms of information processing stages.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194640</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>ccb4010c</fingerprint><author><name>Kyongje Sung</name></author><updated>1521579600000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194640</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kyongje Sung, Barry Gordon&lt;/p&gt;

Khalifa, Bofu Yu, Chris Caroll, Peter Burger, David Mulligan&lt;/p&gt;
Open-cut coal mining in Queensland results in the formation of extensive saline overburden spoil-piles with steep slopes at the angle of repose (approximately 75% or 37&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;). These spoil-piles are generally found in multiple rows, several kilometers in length and heights of up to 50 or 60 m above the original landscape. They are highly dispersive and erodible. Legislation demands that these spoil piles be rehabilitated to minimize on-site and off-site discharges of sediment and salt into the surrounding environment. To achieve this, the steep slopes must be reduced, stabilized against erosion, covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. Key design criteria (slope gradient, slope length and vegetation cover) are required for the construction of post-mining landscapes that will result in acceptable erosion rates.
A novel user-friendly hillslope computer model MINErosion 3.4 was developed that can accurately predict potential erosion rates from field scale hillslopes using parameters measured with a 3m laboratory tilting flume-rainfall simulator or using routinely measured soil physical and chemical properties. This model links MINErosion 2 with a novel consolidation and above ground vegetation cover factors, to the RUSLE and MUSLE equations to predict the mean annual and storm event erosion rates. The RUSLE-based prediction of the mean annual erosion rates allow minesites to derive the key design criteria of slope length, slope gradient and vegetation cover that would lead to acceptable erosion rates. The MUSLE-based prediction of storm event erosion rates will be useful as input into risk analysis of potential damage from erosion.
MINErosion 3.4 was validated against erosion measured on 20 m field erosion plots established on post-mining landscapes at the Oakey Creek and Curragh coalmines, as well as on 120 and 70 m erosion plots on postmining landscapes at Kidston Gold Mine.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194230</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>929e6cd3</fingerprint><author><name>Hwat Bing So</name></author><updated>1522270800000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194230</originId><unread>True</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hwat Bing So, Ashraf M.

Background &lt;p&gt;In Kazakhstan, scarce official prevalence data exists for mood disorders. This study investigates the occurrence of depressive symptoms among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and the relationship between depressive symptoms, HIV treatment initiation and antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients seen at the Almaty AIDS Center between April and December 2013. Two data sources were used: 1) self-administered survey that included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to capture depression symptoms and 2) medical record review. Two primary outcomes were evaluated with log-binomial models and Fisher’s exact test: the relationship between depression symptoms and 1) HIV treatment group, and 2) HIV adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 564 participants, 9.9% reported symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder. None had received treatment for depression. Among those not on ART, a relationship between depressive symptoms and low CD4 counts (≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident (7.1% for CD4 ≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 0.9% for CD4 &gt; 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, p = 0.029). In multivariable analysis, a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms was statistically associated with ART treatment, positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) status, and being unmarried. For those taking ART, treatment adherence was not statistically associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms (12.5% vs 20.0%, p = 0.176); limited power may have impacted statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Untreated depression was found among PLWHA suggesting the need to evaluate access to psychiatric treatment.

Plant-growth promotion has been linked to the &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; genus since the beginning of this research field. In this work, we mined the genome of an Argentinean isolate of the recently described species &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;donghuensis&lt;/i&gt;. Strain SVBP6, isolated from bulk soil of an agricultural plot, showed a broad antifungal activity and several other plant-probiotic activities. As this species has been recently described, and it seems like some plant-growth promoting (PGP) traits do not belong to the classical pseudomonads toolbox, we decide to explore the SVBP6 genome via an bioinformatic approach. Genome inspection confirmed our previous &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results about genes involved in several probiotic activities. Other genetic traits possibly involved in survival of SVBP6 in highly competitive environments, such as rhizospheres, were found. Tn&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt; mutagenesis revealed that the antifungal activity against the soil pathogen &lt;i&gt;Macrophomina phaseolina&lt;/i&gt; was dependent on a functional &lt;i&gt;gacS&lt;/i&gt; gene, from the regulatory cascade Gac-Rsm, but it was not due to volatile compounds.

Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>ff4d936c</fingerprint><author><name>Huai Guan</name></author><updated>1521493200000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</originId><unread>False</unread><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a cytokine mainly secreted by Th17 cells, seems to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Functional genetic polymorphisms in IL-17 and its receptor genes can influence either qualitatively or quantitatively their functions. Therefore, we aimed to study the impact of IL17-A and IL17RC polymorphisms on plasma level of IL-17 and RA susceptibility and severity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this context, IL-17A*rs2275913 and IL-17RC*rs708567 polymorphisms were investigated together with the quantification of IL17 plasma level in 115 RA patients and 91 healthy control subjects matched in age, sex and ethnic origin.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no statistically significant associations between IL-17A and IL-17RC studied polymorphisms and RA susceptibility. In contrast, IL-17A plasma levels were significantly higher in patients (55.07 pg/ml) comparatively to controls (4.75 pg/ml), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;10E-12. A ROC curve was used to evaluate the performance of plasma IL-17 in detecting RA. Given 100% specificity, the highest sensitivity of plasma IL-17A was 61.7% at a cut-off value of 18.25 pg/ml; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10E-21, CI = [0.849–0.939]. Analytic results showed that the IgM-rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies were significantly less frequent in patients with the IL-17RC*A/A genotype than those carrying *G/G and *G/A genotypes; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015, respectively. Otherwise, IL-17 plasma levels’ analysis showed a significant association with the activity of RA (DAS28≥5.1 = 74.71 pg/ml vs. DAS28&amp;lt;5.1 = 11.96 pg/ml), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;10E-6.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;IL-17A*rs2275913 (G/A) and IL-17RC*rs708567 (G/A) polymorphisms did not seem to influence RA susceptibility in Tunisian population. This result agrees with those reported previously.

Otherwise, IL-17 plasma levels’ analysis showed a significant association with the activity of RA (DAS28≥5.1 = 74.71 pg/ml vs. DAS28&amp;lt;5.1 = 11.96 pg/ml), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;10E-6.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;IL-17A*rs2275913 (G/A) and IL-17RC*rs708567 (G/A) polymorphisms did not seem to influence RA susceptibility in Tunisian population. This result agrees with those reported previously. Plasma IL-17A level seems to be predictive of severe RA occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194883</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1622090bcee:1520f5:a077e55f</id><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b10713/20180312/images/medium/jp-2017-10713t_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b10713&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

We have previously investigated the physiological role of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on endochondral bone growth, mainly with mutant mouse models deficient in CNP, and reported that CNP is indispensable for physiological endochondral bone growth in mice. However, the survival rate of CNP knockout (KO) mice fell to as low as about 70% until 10 weeks after birth, and we could not sufficiently analyze the phenotype at the adult stage. Herein, we generated CNP KO rats by using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated genome editing technology. We established two lines of mutant rats completely deficient in CNP (CNP KO rats) that exhibited a phenotype identical to that observed in mice deficient in CNP, namely, a short stature with severely impaired endochondral bone growth. Histological analysis revealed that the width of the growth plate, especially that of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, was markedly lower and the proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes tended to be reduced in CNP KO rats. Notably, CNP KO rats did not have malocclusions and survived for over one year after birth. At 33 weeks of age, CNP KO rats persisted significantly shorter than wild-type rats, with closed growth plates of the femur in all samples, which were not observed in wild-type rats. Histologically, CNP deficiency affected only bones among all body tissues studied.

Strong&lt;/p&gt;
Objectives &lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30–59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact.

Increased production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their widespread application in industrial and consumer products have led to a rise in the release of CNTs into the aquatic environment. CNTs have a very strong adsorption affinity for various environmental contaminants; therefore, they may also influence the toxic effects of other pollutants, such as toxic metals.

Increased production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their widespread application in industrial and consumer products have led to a rise in the release of CNTs into the aquatic environment. CNTs have a very strong adsorption affinity for various environmental contaminants; therefore, they may also influence the toxic effects of other pollutants, such as toxic metals. In this study, the effect of two different functionalized carbon nanotubes, carboxylate and polyethyleneimine modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (C-MWCNTs and N-MWCNT, respectively) on lead toxicity and bioaccumulation was investigated with a freshwater zooplankton &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt;. The acute toxicity results indicate that the different surface properties of the two types of MWCNTs have different effects on lead toxicity to &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magna&lt;/i&gt;. The negatively charged C-MWCNT showed a notable decrease in lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.08 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; C-MWCNT), whereas the positively charged N-MWCNT had only a slight effect on lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.16 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; N-MWCNT). The decrease of lead toxicity was related with the reduced bioavailability of free metal form (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) caused by greater adsorption of lead onto the MWCNTs.
