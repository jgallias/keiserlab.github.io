Worldwide, 500,000 cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) are reported each year and the primary treatment for HNC is radiotherapy. Although the goal of radiotherapy is to target the tumor, secondary exposure occurs in surrounding normal tissues, such as the salivary glands. As a result, despite successful treatment of the cancer, patients are left with long-term side effects due to direct damage to the salivary glands. The effect is chronic and currently there is no treatment. Stem cells are an attractive therapeutic option for treatment of radiation-induced glandular dysfunction because of the potential to regenerate damaged cell populations and restore salivary gland function. However, limited knowledge about the endogenous stem cell population post irradiation hinders the development for stem cell-based therapies. In this study, an ex vivo sphere formation cell culture system was utilized to assess the self-renewal capacity of cells derived from parotid salivary glands at a chronic time point following radiation. Salivary glands from irradiated mice generate significantly fewer salispheres, but can be stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to generate an equivalent number of salispheres as unirradiated salivary glands. Interestingly, the number and size of salispheres formed is dependent on the concentration of FBS supplemented into the media. Salispheres derived from irradiated glands and cultured in FBS media were found to contain cells that proliferate and express progenitor and acinar cell markers such as Keratin 5, Keratin 14, Aquaporin 5, and NKCC1. Utilization of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) injections following radiation treatment restores salivary gland function and improves salisphere generation. These findings indicate that stimulation of these cellular populations may provide a promising avenue for the development of cell-based therapies for radiation-induced salivary gland damage.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Vicky T.

The red flour beetle, &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt;, is an important model insect and agricultural pest. However, many standard genetic tools are lacking or underdeveloped in this system. Here, we present a set of new reagents to augment existing &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; genetic tools. We demonstrate a new GAL4 driver line that employs the promoter of a ribosomal protein gene to drive expression of a UAS responder in the fat body. We also present a novel dual fluorescent reporter that labels cell membranes and nuclei with different fluorophores for the analysis of cellular morphology. This approach also demonstrates the functionality of the viral T2A peptide for bicistronic gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt;. To facilitate classical genetic analysis, we created lines with visible genetic markers by CRISPR-mediated disruption of the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ebony&lt;/i&gt; body color loci with a cassette carrying an attP site, enabling future φC31-mediated integration. Together, the reagents presented here will facilitate more robust genetic analysis in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; and serve as a blueprint for the further development of this powerful model’s genetic toolkit.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Johnathan C.

Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.</description><published>1523602800000</published><title>Connectivity Problems on Heterogeneous Graphs [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25198?af=R</originId><published>1522114450699</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25198?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25198?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626517550b:6cde3:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522114450699</crawled><fingerprint>b52ff12d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03791-y</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03791-y</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/s7G6aABJGMs/s41467-018-03791-y</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conditional privatization of a public siderophore enables &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; to resist cheater invasion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditional privatization of a public siderophore enables &amp;lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&amp;lt;/i&gt; to resist cheater invasion, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03791-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03791-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Pyoverdine is secreted by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa to scavenge iron from its hosts.

Such a scheme could enable NMR spectroscopy at the scale of single cells.</description><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>544</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nature25781-f1.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>High-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy using a solid-state spin sensor</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194227</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194227</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194227</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Harun Karimpur, Kai Hamburger&lt;/p&gt;
The role of mental imagery has been puzzling researchers for more than two millennia. Both positive and negative effects of mental imagery on information processing have been discussed. The aim of this work was to examine how mental imagery affects object recognition and associative learning. Based on different perceptual and cognitive accounts we tested our &lt;i&gt;imagery-induced interaction hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; in a series of two experiments. According to that, mental imagery could lead to (1) a superior performance in object recognition and associative learning if these objects are imagery-congruent (semantically) and to (2) an inferior performance if these objects are imagery-incongruent. In the first experiment, we used a static environment and tested associative learning. In the second experiment, subjects encoded object information in a dynamic environment by means of a virtual sewer system. Our results demonstrate that subjects who received a role adoption task (by means of guided mental imagery) performed better when imagery-congruent objects were used and worse when imagery-incongruent objects were used. We finally discuss our findings also with respect to alternative accounts and plead for a multi-methodological approach for future research in order to solve this issue.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Harun Karimpur</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194227</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2816:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>7ab1db83</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Harun Karimpur, Kai Hamburger&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract &lt;p&gt;Meta-research is research about research. Meta-research may not be as click-worthy as a meta-pug—a pug dog dressed up in a pug costume—but it is crucial to understanding research. A particularly valuable contribution of meta-research is to identify biases in a body of evidence. Bias can occur in the design, conduct, or publication of research and is a systematic deviation from the truth in results or inferences. The findings of meta-research can tell us which evidence to trust and what must be done to improve future research. We should be using meta-research to provide the evidence base for implementing systemic changes to improve research, not for discrediting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dx20SHTzNfY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005972</href></item></canonical><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005972</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16287756338:cba3e:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522691040056</crawled><fingerprint>c55a3db6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lisa Bero&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury still represents a major concern in clinical transplantation, especially in the era of extreme organ shortage and extended criteria donor organs. In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240–340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;RIC 1 group showed significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Zoltan Czigany</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec7:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><fingerprint>968614f6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zoltan Czigany, Christian Bleilevens, Christian Beckers, Christian Stoppe, Michaela Möhring, Andras Fülöp, Attila Szijarto, Georg Lurje, Ulf P.

Objective &lt;p&gt;As genomic research gathers momentum in sub-Saharan Africa, it has become increasingly important to understand the reasons why individuals wish to participate in this kind of medical research. Against the background of communitarianism conceived as typical of African communities, it is often suggested that individuals consent to participate on the grounds of solidarity and to further the common good. In this paper, we seek to explore this contention by presenting data from focus groups with potential research participants about what would influence their decisions to participate in genomic research.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;These focus groups were conducted as part of a larger qualitative study with a purposively selected group of participants from a community situated in south west Nigeria. We conducted fifteen focus group sessions comprising 50 participants organized by age and sex, namely: 1) adult (&gt;30 years) males, 2) adult females, 3) youth (18–30 years) males, and 4) youth females. A mixed age-group was conducted to probe different views between the age groups. There was discordance and clear division between the adults and youths regarding the decision to participate in genomic research based on commitment to communal values. Adults based their decision to participate on altruism and furthering the common good while youths based their decisions on personal benefits and preferences and also took into account the views and welfare of family members and neighbours.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This discordance suggests a ‘generational shift’ and we advance a model of ‘relative solidarity’ among the youths, which is different from the communal solidarity model typical of African communitarianism. Our findings suggest the need for a closer look at strategies for implementation of community engagement and informed consent in genomic research in this region, and we recommend further studies to explore this emerging trend.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Olubunmi Ogunrin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195171</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f45ff:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>8cb246f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olubunmi Ogunrin, Kerry Woolfall, Mark Gabbay, Lucy Frith&lt;/p&gt;

Swarm-founding wasps are endemic and common representatives of neotropical fauna and compose an interesting social tribe of vespids, presenting both complex social characteristics and uncommon traits for a eusocial group, such as the absence of castes with distinct morphology. The paper wasp &lt;i&gt;Protonectarina sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; (Saussure) presents a broad distribution from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, occurring widespread in the Atlantic rainforest and arboreal Caatinga, being absent in the Amazon region. Given the peculiar distribution among swarm-founding wasps, an integrative approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; in a spatial-temporal framework was performed to investigate: the presence of genetic structure and its relationship with the geography, the evolution of distinct morphologic lineages and the possible historical event(s) in Neotropical region, which could explain the observed phylogeographic pattern. Individuals of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sylveirae&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from populations of 16 areas throughout its distribution for DNA extraction and amplification of mitochondrial genes 12S, 16S and COI. Analysis of genetic diversity, construction of haplotype net, analysis of population structure and dating analysis of divergence time were performed. A morphometric analysis was also performed using 8 measures of the body of the adult (workers) to test if there are morphological distinction among populations. Thirty-five haplotypes were identified, most of them exclusively of a group and a high population structure was found. The possibility of genetic divergence because of isolation by distance was rejected. Morphological analysis pointed to a great uniformity in phenotypes, with only a small degree of differentiation between populations of south and the remaining. Divergence time analysis showed a Middle/Late Miocene origin, a period where an extensive marine ingression occurred in South America.

The present study evaluated auditory sensitivity to spectral modulation by determining the modulation depth required to detect modulation phase reversal. This approach may be preferable to spectral modulation detection with a spectrally flat standard, since listeners appear unable to perform the task based on the detection of temporal modulation. While phase reversal thresholds are often evaluated by holding modulation depth constant and adjusting modulation rate, holding rate constant and adjusting modulation depth supports rate-specific assessment of modulation processing. Stimuli were pink noise samples, filtered into seven octave-wide bands (0.125–8 kHz) and spectrally modulated in dB. Experiment 1 measured performance as a function of modulation depth to determine appropriate units for adaptive threshold estimation. Experiment 2 compared thresholds in dB for modulation detection with a flat standard and modulation phase reversal; results supported the idea that temporal cues were available at high rates for the former but not the latter. Experiment 3 evaluated spectral modulation phase reversal thresholds for modulation that was restricted to either one or two neighboring bands. Flanking bands of unmodulated noise had a larger detrimental effect on one-band than two-band targets. Thresholds for high-rate modulation improved with increasing carrier frequency up to 2 kHz, whereas low-rate modulation appeared more consistent across frequency, particularly in the two-band condition. Experiment 4 measured spectral weights for spectral modulation phase reversal detection and found higher weights for bands in the spectral center of the stimulus than for the lowest (0.125 kHz) or highest (8 kHz) band. Experiment 5 compared performance for highly practiced and relatively naïve listeners, and found weak evidence of a larger practice effect at high than low spectral modulation rates. These results provide preliminary data for a task that may provide a better estimate of sensitivity to spectral modulation than spectral modulation detection with a flat standard.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Emily Buss</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195686</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d74d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>6e45d9a8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emily Buss, John Grose&lt;/p&gt;

Competitive pressure to maximize the current bibliometric measures of productivity is jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific literature. Efforts are underway to address the ‘reproducibility crisis’ by encouraging the use of more rigorous, confirmatory methods. However, as long as productivity continues to be defined by the number of discoveries scientists publish, the impact factor of the journals they publish in and the number of times their papers are cited, they will be reluctant to accept high quality methods and consistently conduct and publish confirmatory/replication studies. This exploratory study examined a sample of rigorous Phase II-IV clinical trials, including unpublished studies, to determine if more appropriate metrics and incentives can be developed. The results suggest that rigorous procedures will help reduce false positives, but to the extent that higher quality methods are accepted as the standard of practice, the current bibliometric incentives will discourage innovative studies and encourage scientists to shift their research to less informative studies of subjects that are already being more actively investigated. However, the results also suggest that it is possible to develop a more appropriate system of rewards. In contrast to the current bibliometric incentives, evaluations of the quality of the methods and reproducibility of the results, innovation and diversity of thought, and amount of information produced may serve as measures and incentives that maintain the integrity of the scientific literature and maximize scientific progress.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Mark D.

Discovery of copy number variations (CNVs), a major category of structural variations, have dramatically changed our understanding of differences between individuals and provide an alternate paradigm for the genetic basis of human diseases. CNVs include both copy gain and copy loss events and their detection genome-wide is now possible using high-throughput, low-cost next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. However, accurate detection of CNVs from NGS data is not straightforward due to non-uniform coverage of reads resulting from various systemic biases. We have developed an integrated platform, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV, to handle some of these issues in CNV detection in whole genome NGS data. It has a modular framework comprising five major modules: data pre-treatment, segmentation, variant calling, annotation and visualization. An important feature of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is the functional annotation module that enables the user to identify and prioritize CNVs encompassing various functional elements, genomic features and disease-associations. Parallelization of the segmentation algorithms makes the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV platform even accessible on a desktop. Here we show the effect of sequencing coverage, read length, bin size, data pre-treatment and segmentation approaches on accurate detection of the complete spectrum of CNVs. Performance of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;CopyDAV is evaluated on both simulated data and real data for different sequencing depths.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by cartilage degradation but also by other joint tissues modifications like subchondral bone sclerosis. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to compare secretome of osteoblast isolated from sclerotic (SC) or non sclerotic (NSC) area of OA subchondral bone.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Secretome was analyzed using differential quantitative and relative label free analysis on nanoUPLC G2 HDMS system. mRNA of the more differentially secreted proteins were quantified by RT-PCR in cell culture from 5 other patients. Finally, osteomodulin and fibulin-3 sequences were quantified by western blot and immunoassays in serum and culture supernatants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;175 proteins were identified in NSC osteoblast secretome. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008494. Compared to NSC osteoblast secretome, 12 proteins were significantly less secreted (Osteomodulin, IGFBP5, VCAM-1, IGF2, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, versican, calumenin, IGFBP2, thrombospondin-4, periostin, reticulocalbin 1 and osteonectin), and 13 proteins were significantly more secreted by SC osteoblasts (CHI3L1, fibulin-3, SERPINE2, IGFBP6, SH3BGRL3, SERPINE1, reticulocalbin3, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, TIMP-2, IGFBP3, TIMP-1, SERPINF1, CSF-1). Similar changes in osteomodulin, IGF2, SERPINE1, fibulin-3 and CHI3L1 mRNA levels were observed. ELISAs assays confirm the decrease by half of osteomodulin protein in SC osteoblasts supernatant compared to NSC and in OA patients serum compared to healthy subjects. Fibulin-3 epitopes Fib3-1, Fib3-2 and Fib3-3 were also increased in SC osteoblasts supernatant compared to NSC.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We highlighted some proteins differentially secreted by the osteoblasts coming from OA subchondral bone sclerosis. These changes contribute to explain some features observed in OA subchondral bone, like the increase of bone remodeling or abnormalities in bone matrix mineralization. Among identified proteins, osteomodulin was found decreased and fibulin-3 increased in serum of OA patients. These findings suggest that osteomodulin and fibulin-3 fragments could be biomarkers to monitor early changes in subchondral bone metabolism in OA.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Christelle Sanchez</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194591</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849f0:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>31ad2d79</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christelle Sanchez, Gabriel Mazzucchelli, Cécile Lambert, Fanny Comblain, Edwin DePauw, Yves Henrotin&lt;/p&gt;

We evaluated the feasibility and safety of nictitating membrane fixation to address reduced contact lens stability by the nictitating membrane in a rabbit model. Under general anesthesia, twelve animals received a horizontal mattress suture between the nictitating membrane and the upper eyelid of one eye. To assess the effects of this technique and secondary side effects, contact lens stability test, Schirmer tear test, tear break-up time measurement, eye tissue pathology and morphology were evaluated. Contact lens stability was increased after nictitating membrane fixation. The percentage of contact lens retention in the nictitating membrane fixed rabbit after 4 hours was 90% whereas that in the untreated rabbit was 42.5%. In addition, there were no significant differences in tear quantity and quality between the fixed and untreated eyes. Furthermore, no remarkable pathological lesions were found in gross observation during the 1-month time period or the following pathological examination. In this study, we demonstrated that nictitating membrane fixation increases contact lens stability without specific side effects using a rabbit model. This minimally invasive procedure could be useful when designing animal models for testing new contact lenses and has potential to apply to other biomaterial research on the ocular surface.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>J.

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; is an important cause of infection and commonly colonizes the nasopharynx of young children, along with other potentially pathogenic bacteria. The objectives of this study were to estimate the carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moraxella catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; in young children in Indonesia, and to examine interactions between these bacterial species. 302 healthy children aged 12–24 months were enrolled in community health centers in the Bandung, Central Lombok, and Padang regions. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and stored according to World Health Organization recommendations, and bacterial species detected by qPCR. Pneumococcal serotyping was conducted by microarray and latex agglutination/Quellung. Overall carriage prevalence was 49.5% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, 27.5% for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, 42.7% for &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and 7.3% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, fatal manifestation of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS). Some patients with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis undergo lung transplantation despite their disease-associated bleeding tendency; others die while awaiting donor organs. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical management and outcomes of a cohort with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis who were evaluated for lung transplantation. Six patients with HPS-1 pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and one of two regional lung transplant centers. Their median age was 41.5 years pre-transplant. Three of six patients died without receiving a lung transplant. One of these was referred with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis and died before a donor organ became available, and donor organs were not identified for two other patients sensitized from prior blood product transfusions. Three of six patients received bilateral lung transplants; they did not have a history of excessive bleeding. One patient received peri-operative desmopressin, one was transfused with intra-operative platelets, and one received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intra-operative prothrombin complex concentrate, platelet transfusion, and desmopressin. One transplant recipient experienced acute rejection that responded to pulsed steroids. No evidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction or recurrence of HPS pulmonary fibrosis was detected up to 6 years post-transplant in these three lung transplant recipients. In conclusion, lung transplantation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are viable options for patients with HPS pulmonary fibrosis. Alloimmunization in HPS patients is an important and potentially preventable barrier to lung transplantation; interventions to limit alloimmunization should be implemented in HPS patients at risk of pulmonary fibrosis to optimize their candidacy for future lung transplants.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Souheil El-Chemaly</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194193</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849dc:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>d4eb2434</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Souheil El-Chemaly, Kevin J.

Evidence from literature is mixed regarding a possible association of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and overweight in the offspring. Sexual dimorphism, or sex disparities in the pathogenesis linking GDM exposure to overweight, could be at play. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between GDM and child overweight at 5–7 years. Six hundred pairs (1:1) of Reunionese liveborn singletons selected from a hospital-based birth registry, matched for sex, gestational age, and birth period, underwent a prospective in-home follow-up and were analyzed with respect to their exposure to GDM. The primary outcome was child overweight at 5–7 years, as defined by the International Obesity Task Force. The association between GDM exposure and child overweight was estimated by the odds ratio (OR) using conditional logistic regression models. For the subset of children exposed to GDM with available maternal glycemic data, we analyzed the relationship between maternal glycemic levels during pregnancy and child body mass index (BMI) at 5–7 years with a linear regression model. In light of the significant interaction between sex and GDM, all statistical analyses were then stratified by sex. After controlling for pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal sociodemographic characteristics, the risk of overweight increased with exposure to GDM for boys (adjusted OR: 2.34; 95% confidence interval = 1.26–4.34, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) but not for girls (adjusted OR: 0.56; 95%CI = 0.28–1.10, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.093). Consistent with this, the linear increase of boys’ BMI at 5–7 years with maternal blood glucose levels during pregnancy, in the exposed group, displayed a dose-response relationship. Our findings indicate that exposure to GDM is a risk factor for childhood overweight in boys but not in girls, which adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting greater sensitivity of male offspring to intrauterine hyperglycemia.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Nathalie Le Moullec</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195531</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>5047ace4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathalie Le Moullec, Adrian Fianu, Olivier Maillard, Emilie Chazelle, Nadège Naty, Chantal Schneebeli, Patrick Gérardin, Laetitia Huiart, Marie-Aline Charles, François Favier&lt;/p&gt;

In experiments on five BioNER benchmark datasets covering four major biomedical entity types, our model outperforms state-of- the-art systems and other neural network models by a large margin, even when only limited training data are available. Further analysis shows that the large performance gains come from sharing character- and word-level information between different biomedical entities. The approach creates new opportunities for text-mining approaches to help biomedical scientists better exploit knowledge in biomedical literature.</description><published>1522911600000</published><title>Cross-type Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Deep Multi-Task Learning [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03475-7</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03475-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/y7g5sKA-cbg/s41467-018-03475-7</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CtIP fusion to Cas9 enhances transgene integration by homology-dependent repair&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CtIP fusion to Cas9 enhances transgene integration by homology-dependent repair, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03475-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03475-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The integration of exogenous DNA into the genome using CRISPR–Cas9 often presents a challenge to researchers.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition for which there are currently no medical therapies other than supportive care involving the application of mechanical ventilation. However, mechanical ventilation itself can worsen ARDS by damaging the alveolocapillary barrier in the lungs. This allows plasma-derived fluid and proteins to leak into the airspaces of the lung where they interfere with the functioning of pulmonary surfactant, which increases the stresses of mechanical ventilation and worsens lung injury. Once such ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is underway, managing ARDS and saving the patient becomes increasingly problematic. Maintaining an intact alveolar barrier thus represents a crucial management goal, but the biophysical processes that perforate this barrier remain incompletely understood. To study the dynamics of barrier perforation, we subjected initially normal mice to an injurious ventilation regimen that imposed both volutrauma (overdistension injury) and atelectrauma (injury from repetitive reopening of closed airspaces) on the lung, and observed the rate at which macromolecules of various sizes leaked into the airspaces as a function of the degree of overall injury. Computational modeling applied to our findings suggests that perforations in the alveolocapillary barrier appear and progress according to a rich-get-richer mechanism in which the likelihood of a perforation getting larger increases with the size of the perforation. We suggest that atelectrauma causes the perforations after which volutrauma expands them. This mechanism explains why atelectrauma appears to be essential to the initiation of VILI in a normal lung, and why atelectrauma and volutrauma then act synergistically once VILI is underway.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Katharine L.

solvent effect with one or more solvent parameters or properties of reacting species,
but it is not always possible, and investigations are usually done on too few reactions

The immunological profiles of human specific IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) vary by genetic predisposition, living conditions in different geographical locations and patient’s age. The aim of our study was to analyze sIgE and sIgG4 patterns and their age-dependent changes in patients from the Moscow region. For identifying sIgE and sIgG4 profiles the blood samples from 513 patients aged 6 months to 17 years who were showing symptoms of allergic diseases were analyzed using microarrays containing 31 allergens. The highest sIgE prevalence was observed for birch pollen (32%) among pollen allergens, cat dander (24%) among indoor allergens, and egg whites (21%) among food allergens. The most common sIgG4 response was developed toward egg whites (80% of patients). Age-related elevation was identified for patients with increased sIgE to pollen allergens and indoor allergens (cat or dog dander and house dust mites). For each allergen, the proportion of cases with significant levels of sIgG4 appeared to increase with patients’ age. The data on allergen-specific sIgE and sIgG4 prevalence show both general trends and some local special aspects that are indicative for the Moscow region. This information should be useful in terms of epidemiology of allergic diseases.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Sergei Voloshin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194775</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b2:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>51b4d1bc</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sergei Voloshin, Olga Smoldovskaya, Guzel Feyzkhanova, Alla Arefieva, Lyudmila Pavlushkina, Tatiana Filatova, Veronika Butvilovskaya, Marina Filippova, Yuri Lysov, Sergey Shcherbo, Alexander Makarov, Alla Rubina, Alexander Zasedatelev&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy is increasingly used to treat oligometastatic patients. We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exclusively extracranial&lt;/i&gt; oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRT were pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site, prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitive metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasis control (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFS based on pretreatment factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval to metastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver, or adrenal metastases were associated with OS. Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS.OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66–85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67–100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48–64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24–60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5–35%). Higher biologically effective dose (BED) (p &amp;lt; 0.01) was associated with OS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We identified clinical factors defining oligometastatic patients with favorable outcomes, who we hypothesize are most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Julian C.

Fitting canine cancer incidences through a conventional regression model assumes constant statistical relationships across the study area in estimating the model coefficients. However, it is often more realistic to consider that these relationships may vary over space. Such a condition, known as spatial non-stationarity, implies that the model coefficients need to be estimated locally. In these kinds of local models, the geographic scale, or spatial extent, employed for coefficient estimation may also have a pervasive influence. This is because important variations in the local model coefficients across geographic scales may impact the understanding of local relationships. In this study, we fitted canine cancer incidences across Swiss municipal units through multiple regional models. We computed diagnostic summaries across the different regional models, and contrasted them with the diagnostics of the conventional regression model, using value-by-alpha maps and scalograms. The results of this comparative assessment enabled us to identify variations in the goodness-of-fit and coefficient estimates. We detected spatially non-stationary relationships, in particular, for the variables related to biological risk factors. These variations in the model coefficients were more important at small geographic scales, making a case for the need to model canine cancer incidences locally in contrast to more conventional global approaches. However, we contend that prior to undertaking local modeling efforts, a deeper understanding of the effects of geographic scale is needed to better characterize and identify local model relationships.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Gianluca Boo</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363c:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>231e0806</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gianluca Boo, Stefan Leyk, Christopher Brunsdon, Ramona Graf, Andreas Pospischil, Sara Irina Fabrikant&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Traffic accidents are associated with the visual function of drivers, as well as many other factors. Driving simulator systems have the advantage of controlling for traffic- and automobile-related conditions, and using pinhole glasses can control the degree of concentric concentration of the visual field. We evaluated the effect of concentric constriction of the visual field on automobile driving, using driving simulator tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subjects meeting criteria for normal eyesight were included in the study. Pinhole glasses with variable aperture sizes were adjusted to mimic the conditions of concentric visual field constrictions of 10° and 15°, using a CLOCK CHART&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. The test contained 8 scenarios (2 oncoming right-turning cars and 6 jump-out events from the side).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighty-eight subjects were included in the study; 37 (mean age = 52.9±15.8 years) subjects were assigned to the 15° group, and 51 (mean = 48.6±15.5 years) were assigned to the 10° group. For all 8 scenarios, the number of accidents was significantly higher among pinhole wearing subjects. The average number of all types of accidents per person was significantly higher in the pinhole 10° group (4.59±1.81) than the pinhole 15° group (3.68±1.49) (P = 0.032). The number of accidents associated with jump-out scenarios, in which a vehicle approaches from the side on a straight road with a good view, was significantly higher in the pinhole 10° group than in the pinhole 15° group.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Concentric constriction of the visual field was associated with increased number of traffic accidents.

Koshu is indigenous to Japan and considered the most important wine grape in Japan. Koshu grape berry possesses characteristics that make it unique from European &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vinifera&lt;/i&gt; as wine grape. However, the physiological characteristics of Koshu leaf and internode remain unknown. An understanding of those characteristics would contribute to improvements in Koshu cultivation, thereby enhancing grape berry and wine quality. To identify the genes responsible for the physiological characteristics of Koshu, we comprehensively analyzed leaf and internode differences at the transcriptome level between Koshu and Pinot Noir by RNA sequencing. A total of 248 and 131 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in leaves and internodes, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of these DEGs revealed that “flavonoid biosynthesis” and “glutathione metabolism” pathways were significantly enriched in Koshu leaves. On the other hand, when internodes were compared, “flavonoid”-related GO terms were specifically detected in Koshu. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the expression of such genes as &lt;i&gt;leucoanthocyanidin reductase&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;flavonol synthase&lt;/i&gt; in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was higher in Koshu than Pinot Noir. Measurement of the relative expression levels of these genes by RT-qPCR validated the results obtained by RNA sequencing. The characteristics of Koshu leaf and internode, which are expected to produce flavonoids with antibacterial activity and UV protection function, would suit Japanese climate as a survival strategy.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Shinichi Enoki</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194807</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b4:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>94c9372c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shinichi Enoki, Yu Hamaguchi, Shunji Suzuki, Hiroyuki Fujisawa, Tomoki Hattori, Kayo Arita, Chiho Yamaguchi, Masachika Mikami, Shu Nagasaka, Keisuke Tanaka&lt;/p&gt;

The precursor ribosomal RNA is processed by multiple steps of nucleolytic cleavage to generate mature rRNAs. Utp24 is a PIN domain endonuclease in the early 90S precursor of small ribosomal subunit and is proposed to cleave at sites A1 and A2 of pre-rRNA. Here we determine the crystal structure of Utp24 from &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; at 2.1 angstrom resolution. Utp24 structurally resembles the ribosome assembly factor Utp23 and both contain a Zn-finger motif. Functional analysis in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; shows that depletion of Utp24 disturbs the assembly of 90S and abolishes cleavage at sites A0, A1 and A2.

The precursor ribosomal RNA is processed by multiple steps of nucleolytic cleavage to generate mature rRNAs. Utp24 is a PIN domain endonuclease in the early 90S precursor of small ribosomal subunit and is proposed to cleave at sites A1 and A2 of pre-rRNA. Here we determine the crystal structure of Utp24 from &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; at 2.1 angstrom resolution. Utp24 structurally resembles the ribosome assembly factor Utp23 and both contain a Zn-finger motif. Functional analysis in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; shows that depletion of Utp24 disturbs the assembly of 90S and abolishes cleavage at sites A0, A1 and A2. The 90S assembled with inactivated Utp24 is arrested at a post-A0-cleavage state and contains enriched nuclear exosome for degradation of 5&apos; ETS. Despite of high sequence conservation, Utp24 from other organisms is unable to form an active 90S in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that Utp24 needs to be precisely positioned in 90S. Our study provides biochemical and structural insight into the role of Utp24 in 90S assembly and activity.</description><engagementRate>1.0</engagementRate><published>1523480400000</published><title>Structural and functional analysis of Utp24, an endonuclease for processing 18S ribosomal RNA</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4</originId><published>1523516400000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04442-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Early chromosomal disruption can set the stage for kidney cancer decades later.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162baba357b:f5ba51:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523551188347</crawled><fingerprint>424b64e1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04442-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04442-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Early chromosomal disruption can set the stage for kidney cancer decades later.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04442-4/d41586-018-04442-4_15631140.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Deadly tumours are often born of childhood mutations</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04488-4</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04488-4</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04488-4</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sweet potato migrated to Polynesia thousands of years before people did&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potato migrated to Polynesia thousands of years before people did, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04488-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04488-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;DNA analysis challenges key evidence for pre-Columbian contact between Polynesia and the Americas.</content></content><published>1523516400000</published><author><name>Alex Fox</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>87</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162bb57d476:105f785:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523561518198</crawled><fingerprint>d07714c7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sweet potato migrated to Polynesia thousands of years before people did&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potato migrated to Polynesia thousands of years before people did, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04488-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04488-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;DNA analysis challenges key evidence for pre-Columbian contact between Polynesia and the Americas.</description><engagementRate>0.94</engagementRate><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04488-4/d41586-018-04488-4_15603826.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Sweet potato migrated to Polynesia thousands of years before people did</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195766</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195766</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195766</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ulrike Scherer, Mira Kuhnhardt, Wiebke Schuett&lt;/p&gt;
Although personality traits can largely affect individual fitness we know little about the evolutionary forces generating and maintaining personality variation. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that personality variation in aggression is sexually selected in the monogamous, bi-parental cichlid &lt;i&gt;Pelvicachromis pulcher&lt;/i&gt;. In this species, breeding pairs form territories and they aggressively defend their territory and offspring against con- and heterospecific intruders. In our mate choice study, we followed up two alternative hypotheses. We either expected females to show a directional preference for a high level and high consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for male parental quality). Alternatively, we expected females to choose males for (dis-)similarity in the level/consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for compatibility). Individual level and consistency of aggression were assessed for males and females using mirror tests. After eavesdropping on aggressive behaviour of two males (differing in level and consistency of aggression) females were then allowed to choose between the two males. Males, but not females, showed personality variation in aggression. Further, females generally preferred consistent over inconsistent males independent of their level of aggression. We did not detect a general preference for the level of male aggression. However, we found an above average preference for consistent high-aggression males; whereas female preference for inconsistent high-aggression did not deviate from random choice. Our results suggest behavioural consistency of aggression in male rainbow kribs is selected for via female mate choice. Further, our study underlines the importance of considering both the level and the consistency of a behavioural trait in studies of animal behaviour.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Ulrike Scherer</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195766</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c6:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>9fb58851</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ulrike Scherer, Mira Kuhnhardt, Wiebke Schuett&lt;/p&gt;

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity. Species conservation, however, requires species identification skills, a competence obtained through intensive training and experience. Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition. The idea of automated species identification is approaching reality. We review the technical status quo on computer vision approaches for plant species identification, highlight the main research challenges to overcome in providing applicable tools, and conclude with a discussion of open and future research thrusts.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bfmDpVYKmqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005993</href></item></canonical><engagement>66</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005993</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16296e9f3b9:64366a:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1522950337465</crawled><fingerprint>b311a506</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jana Wäldchen, Michael Rzanny, Marco Seeland, Patrick Mäder&lt;/p&gt;

We review the technical status quo on computer vision approaches for plant species identification, highlight the main research challenges to overcome in providing applicable tools, and conclude with a discussion of open and future research thrusts.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bfmDpVYKmqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522960922575</recrawled><published>1522962000000</published><title>Automated plant species identification—Trends and future directions</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194129</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194129</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194129</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fanwei Dai, Xiting Zhao, Cuiming Tang, Zhenjiang Wang, Zheshi Kuang, Zhiyi Li, Jing Huang, Guoqing Luo&lt;/p&gt;
Mulberry (&lt;i&gt;Morus alba&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an important economic tree species in many countries. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) has become a widely used method for gene expression studies in plants. A suitable reference gene is essential to ensure accurate and reliable results for qRT-PCR analyses. However, no reports describing the selection of reference genes have been published for mulberry. In this work, we evaluated the stability of twenty candidate reference genes in different plant tissues and under different stress conditions by qRT-PCR in mulberry using algorithms in two programs—geNorm and NormFinder. The results revealed that &lt;i&gt;TUB2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;UBI4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ACTIN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RPL4&lt;/i&gt; were ranked as the most stable reference genes in the samples subsets, whereas &lt;i&gt;EF1α4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TUB3&lt;/i&gt;showed the least stability with both algorithms. To further validate the stability of the reference genes, the expression patterns of six genes of mulberry were analyzed by normalization with the selected reference genes.

They’ve been working with various heme proteins, since that reactive center is known to be able to generate carbenes, and they noted one variant, in the presence of ethyl diazoacetate as a carbene source and an aryl acetylene as reactant, gave furan products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo-300x92.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo-300x92.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo.jpeg 526w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13437&quot; height=&quot;92&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are already reported as coming from a carbene mechanism, so the group thought that they must be on to something. Further screening of variants around that particular enzyme isoform turned up some that allowed a second carbene reaction to cycle around, giving the unusual bicyclobutanes shown at right. Freeing up some room around the active site was essential, otherwise the cyclopropene intermediate goes off to the furan product instead. A systematic screen of amino acid variations at the key residues of the enzyme in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, with monitoring of product production, furnished an enzyme that was capable of high turnover (enough to produce hundreds of milligrams of product). A variety of different R groups are tolerated on the phenyl, with yields from 30 to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene-300x85.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene-300x85.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene.jpeg 382w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13438&quot; height=&quot;85&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the phenylcyclopropene intermediate was not isolable, but the team also look for variants that could produce those products as well (in the non-aryl cases). Similar mutation screens against promising enzymes produced another one that could indeed furnish a variety of cyclopropenes, as shown at right, in yields of 35 to 85%. Variants were found that could produced enhanced ratios of either enantiomer, to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sorts of reactions are known in the literature, up to a point (here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/Topics/Maciej.pdf&quot;&gt;review presentation&lt;/a&gt; from the Wipf group a few years back on the topic). But such things are mostly seen on very electron-deficient alkynes and often go in lower yields than what are reported here (and I think you can largely forget about enantioselectivity). The fact that enzymes can be made to do such chemistry is remarkable, and there are surely many more such things waiting to be discovered. The metal centers in these proteins do a lot of extraordinary chemistry, and many groups are in the process of harnessing them for synthetic purposes. Seeing unusual strained systems like this being formed so readily just shows how much must be possible!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><visual><width>526</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>162</height><url>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo.jpeg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here’s a remarkable paper that shows how enzymes can be engineered to turn out some very unnatural-looking structures.

Moreover, despite being performed purely in the index, the running time of search using our optimal schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the best state-of-the-art aligners, which benefit from combining search in index with in-text verification using dynamic programming. As a result, we anticipate a full-fledged aligner that employs an intelligent combination of search in the bidirectional FM-index using our optimal search schemes and in-text verification using dynamic programming outperforms today&apos;s best aligners.

Moreover, despite being performed purely in the index, the running time of search using our optimal schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the best state-of-the-art aligners, which benefit from combining search in index with in-text verification using dynamic programming. As a result, we anticipate a full-fledged aligner that employs an intelligent combination of search in the bidirectional FM-index using our optimal search schemes and in-text verification using dynamic programming outperforms today&apos;s best aligners. The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future work.</description><published>1523602800000</published><title>Optimum Search Schemes for Approximate String Matching Using Bidirectional FM-Index [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24104-9</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24104-9</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/9ez_vTMpSK0/s41598-018-24104-9</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Disposition of a Glucose Load into Hepatic Glycogen by Direct and Indirect Pathways in Juvenile Seabass and Seabream&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Disposition of a Glucose Load into Hepatic Glycogen by Direct and Indirect Pathways in Juvenile Seabass and Seabream, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24104-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24104-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Disposition of a Glucose Load into Hepatic Glycogen by Direct and Indirect Pathways in Juvenile Seabass and Seabream&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/9ez_vTMpSK0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>João Rito</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24104-9</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162bbf0bc1b:1118831:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523571538971</crawled><fingerprint>5e05a4b3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Disposition of a Glucose Load into Hepatic Glycogen by Direct and Indirect Pathways in Juvenile Seabass and Seabream&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Disposition of a Glucose Load into Hepatic Glycogen by Direct and Indirect Pathways in Juvenile Seabass and Seabream, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24104-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24104-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Disposition of a Glucose Load into Hepatic Glycogen by Direct and Indirect Pathways in Juvenile Seabass and Seabream&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/9ez_vTMpSK0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1523602800000</published><title>Author Correction: Disposition of a Glucose Load into Hepatic Glycogen by Direct and Indirect Pathways in Juvenile Seabass and Seabream</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194416</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194416</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194416</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kate S.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Aspartame (L-aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester) is a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) approved for use in more than 6000 dietary products and pharmaceuticals consumed by the general public including adults and children, pregnant and nursing mothers. However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism. In the adrenal glands of ASP-exposed mice, GABA and Glutamate receptor subunit genes were amongst those most highly upregulated. Developmental NMDAR antagonism alone had less effect on adulthood gene expression and affected mainly hypothalamic neurogenesis and adrenal steroid metabolism. Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Kate S.

Ethanol (ET) is a substance that modulates the Central Nervous System (CNS). Frequently, ET intake occurs combined with energy drinks, which contain taurine (TA), an important amino acid found in the body (i.e brain and muscles). Although TA administration has been used in the improvement of physical performance, the impact of TA, ET and exercise remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the acute effect of 6g of Taurine (TA), 0.6 mL∙kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of Ethanol (ET), and Taurine combined with Ethanol (TA+ET) ingestion on the electrocortical activity before and after a moderate intensity exercise in 9 subjects, 5 women (counterbalanced experimental design). In each of the 4 treatments (Placebo—PL, TA, ET and TA+ET), electroencephalography (EEG) tests were conducted in order to analyze changes in absolute beta power (ABP) in the frontal lobe in 3 moments: baseline (before ingestion), peak (before exercise) and post-exercise. In the PL treatment, the frontal areas showed decrease in ABP after exercise. However, in the ET+TA treatment, ABP values were greater after exercise, except for Fp1. The ET treatment had no effect on the Superior Frontal Gyrus area (F3, Fz and F4) and ABP decreased after exercise in Fp1 and Fp2. In the TA treatment, ABP increased after exercise, while it decreased at the peak moment in most of the frontal regions, except for Fp1, F3 and Fz. We concluded that after a moderate intensity exercise, a decrease in cortical activity occurs in placebo treatment. Moreover, we found a inhibitory effect of TA on cortical activity before exercise and a increased in cortical activity after exercise. A small ET dose is not enough to alter ABP in all regions of the frontal cortex and, in combination with TA, it showed an increase in the frontal cortex activity at the post-exercise moment.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Dailson Paulucio</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194264</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cfa0b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>1d017377</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dailson Paulucio, Augusto Terra, Caleb G.

Despite the double burden of infectious and chronic non-communicable diseases in Africa, health care expenditure disproportionately favours infectious diseases. In this paper, we examine quantitatively the extent of this disproportionate access to diagnoses and treatment of diabetes, hypertension and malaria in Ghana. A total of 220 health facilities was surveyed across the country in 2011. Findings indicate that diagnoses and treatment of infectious diseases were more accessible than NCDs. In terms of treatment, 78% and 87% of health facilities had two of the recommended malaria drugs while less than 35% had essential diabetes and hypertension drugs. There is a significant unmet need for diagnoses and treatment of NCDs in Ghana. These inequities have implications for high morbidity and mortality from NCDs. We recommend the use of task shifting as a model to increase the delivery of NCD services.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Mawuli Komla Kushitor</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194677</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51cd:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>a3e5b8bd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mawuli Komla Kushitor, Sandra Boatemaa&lt;/p&gt;

In terms of treatment, 78% and 87% of health facilities had two of the recommended malaria drugs while less than 35% had essential diabetes and hypertension drugs. There is a significant unmet need for diagnoses and treatment of NCDs in Ghana. These inequities have implications for high morbidity and mortality from NCDs. We recommend the use of task shifting as a model to increase the delivery of NCD services.</description><published>1521838800000</published><title>The double burden of disease and the challenge of health access: Evidence from Access, Bottlenecks, Cost and Equity facility survey in Ghana</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25204?af=R</originId><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25204?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25204?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1520236800000</published><author><name>JacekKoput</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162956fcc6f:a3d99e3:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522925554799</crawled><fingerprint>e7057727</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The accurate ground‐state potential energy surface of germanium dicarbide, GeC2, has been determined from ab initio calculations using the coupled‐cluster approach.

Natural reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;Yersinia (Y&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; comprise different animal species, but little is known about the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of yersiniosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218). The remaining 18 isolates belonged to bio-serotypes 1B/NI (3/218, 1.4%), 1B/O:8 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/NI (6/218, 2.8%), 2/O:27 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:9 (2/218, 0.9%), 3/NI (2/218, 0.9%), 4/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%) and 4/O:9 (1/218, 0.5%).

Background &lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), a test of cure (TOC) within 3–5 weeks is not recommended. International guidelines differ in advising a &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) TOC. Retesting CT and NG positives within 3–12 months is recommended in international guidelines. We assessed TOC and retesting practices including extragenital testing in general practitioner (GP) practices located in different socioeconomic status (SES) areas to inform and optimize local test practices.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Laboratory data of 48 Dutch GP practices between January 2011 and July 2016 were used. Based on a patient’s first positive CT or NG test, the proportion of TOC (&amp;lt;3 months) and retests (3–12 months) were calculated. Patient- and GP-related factors were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For CT (n = 622), 20% had a TOC and 24% had a retest at the GP practice. GP practices in low SES areas were more likely to perform a CT TOC (OR:1.8;95%CI:1.1–3.1). Younger patients (&amp;lt;25 years) were more likely to have a CT TOC (OR:1.6;95%CI:1.0–2.4). For CT (n = 622), 2.4% had a TOC and 6.1% had a retest at another STI care provider. For NG (n = 73), 25% had a TOC and 15% had a retest at the GP practice. For NG (n = 73), 2.7% had a TOC and 12.3% had a retest at another STI care provider. In only 0.3% of the consultations patients were tested on extragenital sites.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Almost 20% of the patients returned for a CT TOC, especially at GP practices in low SES areas. For NG, 1 out of 4 patients returned for a TOC. Retesting rates were low for both CT (24%) and NG (15%), (re)infections including extragenital infections may be missed. Efforts are required to focus TOC and increase retesting practices of GPs in order to improve CT/NG control.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Juliën N.

Perceived time constraints have been highlighted in sociological studies as representing a core issue in determining quality of life. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that gender inequalities regarding insufficiency of time play a role in the development of overweight and obesity in adults. The study used baseline data (2008–2010) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), which monitors a cohort of 15,105 civil servants of 35 to 74 years of age. Insufficient time for personal care and leisure due to professional and domestic duties, as detailed in a structured questionnaire, comprised the main exposure variable. The outcome variable was overweight/obesity measured according to body mass index. Prevalence ratios were calculated using multinomial logistic regression. A greater proportion of women compared to men reported insufficient time for personal care and leisure (34.5% versus 23.8%, respectively). The prevalence of overweight was greater in men, while obesity was more common in women. Insufficient time for personal care and leisure was associated with overweight (PR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.04–1.61) and obesity (PR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.28–2.12) only in women working over 40 hours/week. No significant association was found for males. These results suggest that the length of the working week influences factors underlying weight gain, possibly issues linked to behavior and/or stress mechanisms. The fact that such an association was restricted to women suggests that the results originate from gender inequalities involving relationships between time and health. The findings of this study provide data on which to base public policies aimed at encouraging the redistribution of domestic responsibilities in the direction of gender equity, as well as macrosocial policies such as providing public schools for workers’ children.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Karina Araujo Pinto</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194190</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d5f:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>85f03dc5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karina Araujo Pinto, Rosane Harter Griep, Lucia Rotenberg, Maria da Conceição Chagas Almeida, Rosane Sousa Barreto, Estela M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Vector control remains the sole effective method to prevent dengue virus (DENV) transmission, although a vaccine for dengue has recently become available and testing of its efficacy and coverage is being performed in multiple places. Entomological surveillance is a key factor in alerting authorities to possible outbreaks, but until now natural DENV infection of mosquito populations has been scarcely used as an early warning system to monitor fluctuating prevalence of infected mosquitoes. The purpose of this study was to determine the burden of adult and larval/pupae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt; with DENV in urban areas in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Immature insect forms (larvae and pupae) were collected from April 2011 to March 2012, whereas the collection of adults was conducted along 3 years: May 2011 to April 2014. Total RNAs of the samples were extracted and the nested reverse transcriptase PCR assay for detecting and typing DENV was performed. Of the 1333 immature insects collected during the study period, 1186 (89%) were &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and 147 (11%) &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. DENV-4 was identified in pools of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; larvae. The rate of DENV infection in immature &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was expressed as MIR = 3.37. DENV wasnot detected in immature &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 1360 adult female mosquitoes of the &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; genus were captured from May 2011 to April 2014. Of this total, 1293 were &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; (95%) and 67 were &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; (5%). From the 130 pools studied, 27 (20.7%) were positive for DENV. DENV-1 was identified in 2/27 (7.4%) pools; 1of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; and 1 of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;Vector control remains the sole effective method to prevent dengue virus (DENV) transmission, although a vaccine for dengue has recently become available and testing of its efficacy and coverage is being performed in multiple places. Entomological surveillance is a key factor in alerting authorities to possible outbreaks, but until now natural DENV infection of mosquito populations has been scarcely used as an early warning system to monitor fluctuating prevalence of infected mosquitoes. The purpose of this study was to determine the burden of adult and larval/pupae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt; with DENV in urban areas in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Immature insect forms (larvae and pupae) were collected from April 2011 to March 2012, whereas the collection of adults was conducted along 3 years: May 2011 to April 2014. Total RNAs of the samples were extracted and the nested reverse transcriptase PCR assay for detecting and typing DENV was performed. Of the 1333 immature insects collected during the study period, 1186 (89%) were &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and 147 (11%) &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. DENV-4 was identified in pools of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; larvae. The rate of DENV infection in immature &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was expressed as MIR = 3.37. DENV wasnot detected in immature &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 1360 adult female mosquitoes of the &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; genus were captured from May 2011 to April 2014. Of this total, 1293 were &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; (95%) and 67 were &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; (5%). From the 130 pools studied, 27 (20.7%) were positive for DENV. DENV-1 was identified in 2/27 (7.4%) pools; 1of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; and 1 of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. DENV-2 was identified in only 1/27 (3.7%) &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; pools.

The anatomical location of adipose tissue might have direct implications for its functionality and risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. To determine the expression of genes related to energy expenditure and the levels of some adipokines, histological examinations, quantitative PCR, and protein expression measurements in adipocyte precursor cells were performed. Periaortic adipocytes were smaller than those from subcutaneous tissue. Moreover, weight gain induced periaortic adipocyte hypertrophy (r = -0.91, p&amp;lt;0.01). Compared to subcutaneous tissue, adiponectin, FABP4, IL-4 and IL-6 was decreased in periaortic adipocytes, whereas FGF21, UCP-1, PGC-1a, CITED1, Omentin and TFAM (Mitochondrial protein) increased. Upon analyzing patients’ clinical conditions, it emerged that the levels of PGC-1a both in male (r = -0.48 p&amp;lt;0.04) and female (r = -0.61, p&amp;lt;0.05) and TFAM in male (r = -0.72, p&amp;lt;0.0008) and female (r = -0.86, p&amp;lt;0.002) decreased significantly with progressive weight gain. However, no differences were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus 2 or Hyperlipidemia. Adipocytes surrounding the ascending aorta present markers of major thermogenic activity than those in subcutaneous tissue. Nevertheless, this characteristic might change, due to unfavorable metabolic conditions such as obesity, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Diana Vargas</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194269</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f3:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>efb78e8a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Vargas, Carolina López, Edward Acero, Edgar Benitez, Angélica Wintaco, Jaime Camacho, Marisol Carreño, Juan Umaña, Daniela Jimenez, Said Díaz, Fernando Lizcano&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Maternal morbidity and mortality is still a major public health issue in low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Improving access to antenatal care (ANC) services for pregnant women has been widely recognized as one of the most effective means of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity. As such, this study examined the barriers for pregnant women living in rural, agricultural villages to accessing ANC based on data collected in the Ratanakiri province, one of the least developed provinces in Cambodia, using a combination of a community-based cross-sectional survey and a geographic information system (GIS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 377 mothers with children under the age of two living in 62 villages in the Ratanakiri province, Cambodia, in December 2015. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to ask mothers about their ANC service use, knowledge of ANC, barriers to accessing health facilities, and complications they experienced during the most recent pregnancy. At the same time, GIS data were also collected using a Global Positioning System (GPS) to accurately measure actual travel distance of pregnant women to access health facilities and to examine geographical and environmental barriers in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Only a third of the mothers met the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) of receiving ANC four times or more (achieved ANC4+), and a quarter of the mothers had never received ANC during their most recent pregnancy. Factors positively associated with achieving ANC4+ were mother’s secondary or higher education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.74, 17.37), being aware that receiving ANC is recommended (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.25, 6.00), and knowledge about the recommended frequency for ANC (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI: 7.22). Actual travel distance was negatively associated with achieving ANC4+. Mothers who had to travel 10.0–14.9 km were 68% less likely (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.99), and those who had to travel 15.0 km or longer were 79% less likely (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.62) to have achieved ANC 4+, both compared to those who travelled 5.0 km or less. While most previous studies have used a straight-line to measure distance traveled, this study much more accurately measured the actual distance traveled by using a GIS. As a result, there was a statistically significant discrepancy between actual travel distance and straight-line distance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study revealed promoting factors and barriers for ANC use among pregnant women living in remote, agricultural villages in Cambodia. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of measuring travel distances accurately to ensure that targeted interventions for ANC are not misguided by straight-line distances. The methodology used in this study can be applied widely to other developing countries, especially in remote areas with limited road networks where there may be a large discrepancy between actual and straight-line distances.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Junko Yasuoka</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194103</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88ec:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>bff1cb93</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junko Yasuoka, Keiko Nanishi, Kimiyo Kikuchi, Sumihiro Suzuki, Po Ly, Boukheng Thavrin, Tsutomu Omatsu, Tetsuya Mizutani&lt;/p&gt;

We test the hypothesis that prehistoric Native American land use influenced the Euro-American settlement process in a South Carolina Piedmont landscape. Long term ecological studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and trajectories in complex, coupled social and ecological systems. Native American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajectories of many North American landscapes. Yet, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of land use legacies of prehistoric Native Americans. At the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly “wild” landscape or an already “humanized” landscape. We use statistical event analysis to model the effects of prehistoric Native American settlement on the rate of Colonial land grants (1749–1775). Our results reveal how abandoned Native American settlements were among the first areas claimed and homesteaded by Euro-Americans. We suggest that prehistoric land use legacies served as key focal nodes in the Colonial era settlement process. As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Michael R.

Inertial sensors offer the potential for integration into wireless virtual reality systems that allow the users to walk freely through virtual environments. However, owing to drift errors, inertial sensors cannot accurately estimate head and body orientations in the long run, and when walking indoors, this error cannot be corrected by magnetometers, due to the magnetic field distortion created by ferromagnetic materials present in buildings. This paper proposes a technique, called EHBD (Equalization of Head and Body Directions), to address this problem using two head- and shoulder-located magnetometers. Due to their proximity, their distortions are assumed to be similar and the magnetometer measurements are used to detect when the user is looking straight forward. Then, the system corrects the discrepancies between the estimated directions of the head and the shoulder, which are provided by gyroscopes and consequently are affected by drift errors. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of this technique in two tasks (navigation and navigation plus exploration) and using two different locomotion techniques: (1) gaze-directed mode (GD) in which the walking direction is forced to be the same as the head direction, and (2) decoupled direction mode (DD) in which the walking direction can be different from the viewing direction. The obtained results show that both locomotion modes show similar matching of the target path during the navigation task, while DD’s path matches the target path more closely than GD in the navigation plus exploration task. These results validate the EHBD technique especially when allowing different walking and viewing directions in the navigation plus exploration tasks, as expected. While the proposed method does not reach the accuracy of optical tracking (ideal case), it is an acceptable and satisfactory solution for users and is much more compact, portable and economical.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Ernesto de la Rubia</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195191</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4601:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>5fed306f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto de la Rubia, Antonio Diaz-Estrella, Arcadio Reyes-Lecuona, Alyson Langley, Michael Brown, Sarah Sharples&lt;/p&gt;

While the proposed method does not reach the accuracy of optical tracking (ideal case), it is an acceptable and satisfactory solution for users and is much more compact, portable and economical.</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>Natural locomotion based on a reduced set of inertial sensors: Decoupling body and head directions indoors</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03800-6</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03800-6</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03800-6</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immune memory in the brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immune memory in the brain, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03800-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03800-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The brain’s resident immune cells retain a long-lasting memory of peripheral inflammation.

The peregrine falcon &lt;i&gt;Falco peregrinus&lt;/i&gt; is renowned for attacking its prey from high altitude in a fast controlled dive called a stoop. Many other raptors employ a similar mode of attack, but the functional benefits of stooping remain obscure. Here we investigate whether, when, and why stooping promotes catch success, using a three-dimensional, agent-based modeling approach to simulate attacks of falcons on aerial prey. We simulate avian flapping and gliding flight using an analytical quasi-steady model of the aerodynamic forces and moments, parametrized by empirical measurements of flight morphology. The model-birds’ flight control inputs are commanded by their guidance system, comprising a phenomenological model of its vision, guidance, and control. To intercept its prey, model-falcons use the same guidance law as missiles (pure proportional navigation); this assumption is corroborated by empirical data on peregrine falcons hunting lures. We parametrically vary the falcon’s starting position relative to its prey, together with the feedback gain of its guidance loop, under differing assumptions regarding its errors and delay in vision and control, and for three different patterns of prey motion. We find that, when the prey maneuvers erratically, high-altitude stoops increase catch success compared to low-altitude attacks, but only if the falcon’s guidance law is appropriately tuned, and only given a high degree of precision in vision and control. Remarkably, the optimal tuning of the guidance law in our simulations coincides closely with what has been observed empirically in peregrines. High-altitude stoops are shown to be beneficial because their high airspeed enables production of higher aerodynamic forces for maneuvering, and facilitates higher roll agility as the wings are tucked, each of which is essential to catching maneuvering prey at realistic response delays.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ypEvewr7kSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006044</href></item></canonical><engagement>15</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006044</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162baf3e3ad:bf9d1f:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523554968493</crawled><fingerprint>234a5718</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagementRate>15.0</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robin Mills, Hanno Hildenbrandt, Graham K.

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hb&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA or protein. Instead, we find that Pum and Nos control the accumulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in testes.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Tammy H.

Instead, we find that Pum and Nos control the accumulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in testes.</description><published>1522443600000</published><title>No significant regulation of &amp;lt;i&gt;bicoid&amp;lt;/i&gt; mRNA by Pumilio or Nanos in the early &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt; embryo</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5004971?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5004971?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5004971?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522033785000</published><author><name>Zoltán Rolik</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88fd:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><fingerprint>5925120</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Novel strategy to implement active-space coupled-cluster methods</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194423</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194423</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194423</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alberto Bresciani, Maria Carolina Spiezia, Roberto Boggio, Cristina Cariulo, Anja Nordheim, Roberta Altobelli, Kirsten Kuhlbrodt, Celia Dominguez, Ignacio Munoz-Sanjuan, John Wityak, Valentina Fodale, Deanna M.

Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that can generate energy for cells or clear misfolded or aggregated proteins, and upregulating this process has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe a novel set of LC3B-II and p62 time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assays that can detect changes in autophagy in the absence of exogenous labels. Lipidated LC3 is a marker of autophagosomes, while p62 is a substrate of autophagy. These assays can be employed in high-throughput screens to identify novel autophagy upregulators, and can measure autophagy changes in cultured cells or tissues after genetic or pharmacological interventions. We also demonstrate that different cells exhibit varying autophagic responses to pharmacological interventions. Overall, it is clear that a battery of readouts is required to make conclusions about changes in autophagy.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Alberto Bresciani</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194423</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623feefaa4:299c674:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521491049124</crawled><fingerprint>88f4d77a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alberto Bresciani, Maria Carolina Spiezia, Roberto Boggio, Cristina Cariulo, Anja Nordheim, Roberta Altobelli, Kirsten Kuhlbrodt, Celia Dominguez, Ignacio Munoz-Sanjuan, John Wityak, Valentina Fodale, Deanna M.

Cancer affects 39.6% of Americans at some point during their lifetime. Solid tumor microenvironments are characterized by a disorganized, leaky vasculature that promotes regions of low oxygenation (hypoxia). Tumor hypoxia is a key predictor of poor treatment outcome for all radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy and surgery procedures, and is a hallmark of metastatic potential. In particular, the radiation therapy dose needed to achieve the same tumor control probability in hypoxic tissue as in normoxic tissue can be up to 3 times higher. Even very small tumors (&amp;lt;2–3 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) comprise 10–30% of hypoxic regions in the form of chronic and/or transient hypoxia fluctuating over the course of seconds to days. We investigate the potential of recently developed lipid-stabilized oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) to improve the therapeutic ratio of RT. OMBs, but not nitrogen microbubbles (NMBs), are shown to significantly increase dissolved oxygen content when added to water in vitro and increase tumor oxygen levels in vivo in a rat fibrosarcoma model. Tumor control is significantly improved with OMB but not NMB intra-tumoral injections immediately prior to RT treatment and effect size is shown to depend on initial tumor volume on RT treatment day, as expected.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Samantha M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine the comparative safety of individual NSAIDs when given concomitantly with clopidogrel.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Medicaid claims from five US states during 1999–2010, supplemented with Medicare claims for dual-enrollees. The exposure of interest was the first concomitant use of clopidogrel and one of the 10 selected NSAIDs after a 1-year baseline period. The outcomes were: all-cause mortality; acute myocardial infarction (AMI)/ischemic stroke; and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)/intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). We calculated the hazard ratio of each NSAID for each outcome, with ibuprofen as the reference drug, using high-dimensional propensity score-adjusted proportional-hazards regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 1,060,412 clopidogrel users, 268,114 concomitant NSAID users met inclusion/exclusion criteria, contributing 48,483 person-years. We observed 2,463 deaths, 2,822 AMI/ischemic stroke outcomes, and 2,620 GIB/ICH outcomes, for unadjusted incidence rates of 50.8, 58.6, and 54.3 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Compared with ibuprofen and controlling for potential confounders, rofecoxib (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04, 1.43) and valdecoxib (HR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.92) showed higher and lower hazards of mortality, respectively. Indomethacin showed an increased AMI/ischemic stroke hazard (HR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.74). For GIB/ICH, indomethacin (HR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.74, 2.73), diclofenac (HR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.39, 1.97), naproxen (HR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.70), and rofecoxib (HR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.48) showed higher hazards, and valdecoxib (HR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.98) showed a lower hazard.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The bleeding risks of individual NSAIDs varied more markedly than thrombotic risks when used concomitantly with clopidogrel.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression could be discussed as an adaption that promotes repair and counteracts cell damage. Myoglobin is released upon muscle damage of several pathways. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the expression of HSP70 in kidney, heart and brain and of myoglobin in the kidney were associated with the cause of death and the survival times after lethal intoxications with three of the drugs most widely used in our local area (Saxony, Germany) as well as after fatal traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively collected kidney, heart and brain samples of 50 autopsy cases with toxicological proved lethal intoxication (main drugs methamphetamine, morphine, alcohol), 14 TBI cases and 15 fatalities with acute myocardial injury in age- and gender-matched compilations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our main findings suggest that HSP70 is associated with hyperthermal and other stress factors of most cell populations. HSP70 expressions in kidney and heart muscle are useful for a differentiation between fatal intoxications and cases without toxicological influence (p &amp;lt; 0.05). There were significant differences in the cerebral expression patterns between methamphetamine- and morphine-associated deaths compared to alcohol fatalities (p &amp;lt; 0.05). An intensive staining of HSP70 in the pericontusional zone and the hippocampus after TBI (especially neuronal and vascular) was shown even after short survival times and may be useful as an additional marker in questions of vitality or wound age. A relevant myoglobin decoration of renal tubules was only shown for methamphetamine abuse in the study presented.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In sum, the immunohistochemical characteristics presented can be supportive for determining final death circumstances and minimal trauma survival times but are not isolated usefully for the detection of drug- or trauma-induced hyperthermia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Benjamin Ondruschka</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194442</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123929:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>f3bb380a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Ondruschka, Franziska Rosinsky, Heiner Trauer, Eckhardt Schneider, Jan Dreßler, Heike Franke&lt;/p&gt;

The Florida manatee (&lt;i&gt;Trichechus manatus latirotris&lt;/i&gt;) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three G-tetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region.

The Florida manatee (&lt;i&gt;Trichechus manatus latirotris&lt;/i&gt;) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three G-tetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs.</description><published>1523307600000</published><title>Identification of G-quadruplex forming sequences in three manatee papillomaviruses</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03530-3</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03530-3</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/iTjrYmYDdiE/s41467-018-03530-3</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peli1 negatively regulates noncanonical NF-κB signaling to restrain systemic lupus erythematosus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peli1 negatively regulates noncanonical NF-κB signaling to restrain systemic lupus erythematosus, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03530-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03530-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder mediated by excessive autoantibodies.

In skeletal muscle the coordinated actions of two mechanically coupled Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels—the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1) and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1)–underlie the molecular mechanism of rapid cytosolic [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] increase leading to contraction. While both [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and contractile activity have been implicated in the regulation of myogenesis, less is known about potential specific roles of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 and RYR1 in skeletal muscle development. In this study, we analyzed the histology and the transcriptomic changes occurring at E14.5 –the end of primary myogenesis and around the onset of intrauterine limb movement, and at E18.5 –the end of secondary myogenesis, in WT, RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; murine limb skeletal muscle. At E14.5 the muscle histology of both mutants exhibited initial alterations, which became much more severe at E18.5. Immunohistological analysis also revealed higher levels of activated caspase-3 in the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; muscles at E14.5, indicating an increase in apoptosis. With WT littermates as controls, microarray analyses identified 61 and 97 differentially regulated genes (DEGs) at E14.5, and 493 and 1047 DEGs at E18.5, in RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; samples, respectively. Gene enrichment analysis detected no overlap in the affected biological processes and pathways in the two mutants at E14.5, whereas at E18.5 there was a significant overlap of DEGs in both mutants, affecting predominantly processes linked to muscle contraction. Moreover, the E18.5 vs. E14.5 comparison revealed multiple genotype-specific DEGs involved in contraction, cell cycle and miRNA-mediated signaling in WT, neuronal and bone development in RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;, and lipid metabolism in Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; samples. Taken together, our study reveals discrete changes in the global transcriptome occurring in limb skeletal muscle from E14.5 to E18.5 in WT, RYR1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice.

Many physical simulations aim at evaluating the net interaction between two rigid bodies, resulting from the cumulative effect of pairwise interactions between their constituents. This is manifested particularly in biomolecular applications such as hierarchical protein folding instances where the interaction between almost rigid domains directly influences the folding pathway, the interaction between macromolecules for drug design purposes, self-assembly of nanoparticles for drug design and drug delivery, and design of smart materials and bio-sensors. In general, the brute force approach requires quadratic (in terms of the number of particles) number of pairwise evaluation operations for any relative pose of the two bodies, unless simplifying assumptions lead to a collapse of the computational complexity. We propose to approximate the pairwise interaction function using a linear predictor function, in which the basis functions have separated forms, i.e. the variables that describe local geometries of the two rigid bodies and the ones that reflect the relative pose between them are split in each basis function. Doing so replaces the quadratic number of interaction evaluations for each relative pose with a one-time quadratic computation of a set of characteristic parameters at a preprocessing step, plus constant number of pose function evaluations at each pose, where this constant is determined by the required accuracy of approximation as well as the efficiency of the used approximation method. We will show that the standard deviation of the error for the net interaction is linearly (in terms of number of particles) proportional to the regression error, if the regression errors are from a normal distribution. Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Pouya Tavousi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195618</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529d:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>7fa8e306</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pouya Tavousi&lt;/p&gt;

Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision.</description><published>1523307600000</published><title>Approximating net interactions among rigid domains</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3180.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3180.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3180.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs) possess a diversity of alkaloid skeletons whose biosynthesis is poorly understood.

Exposure to intense predation risk can induce morphological and behavioural phenotypes that prepare prey, often at young ages, for surviving attacks from unknown predators. However, previous studies revealed that this survival advantage depended on the predator species. Here, we used alarm cues from injured conspecifics to simulate a period of high predation risk for embryonic wood frogs, &lt;i&gt;Lithobates sylvaticus&lt;/i&gt;. Two weeks post-hatching, we tested whether the embryonic risk exposure influenced survival in encounters with two novel predators: (1) a spider (&lt;i&gt;Dolomedes&lt;/i&gt; sp.) that ambushes prey exclusively on the surface of the water, and (2) the adult predacious diving beetle (&lt;i&gt;Dytiscus&lt;/i&gt; sp.) which displays underwater sit-and-wait posture and pursuit tactics. Tadpoles exposed to embryonic high-risk survived longer when encountering spiders, whereas background risk had no influence on survival with adult beetles. These findings, coupled with survival studies involving other predator types, indicate that a high-risk environment promotes tadpole survival in future encounters with unknown sit-and-wait predators, but at the cost of increased vulnerability to novel predators capable of active pursuit.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Adam L.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To develop screening tools for neuropathic pain caused by spinal disorders, the Spine pain&lt;i&gt;DETECT&lt;/i&gt; questionnaire (SPDQ) and its short-form version (SF-SPDQ), by modifying the Japanese version of the pain&lt;i&gt;DETECT&lt;/i&gt; questionnaire (PDQ-J), and to validate these tools.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from patients with neuropathic pain caused by spinal disorders (NeP-SD) and patients with nociceptive pain caused by joint disorders (NocP) as controls, we devised a scoring system for the SPDQ by calculating weighting coefficients for nine PDQ-J items. Simultaneously, we selected some items for the SF-SPDQ.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To develop screening tools for neuropathic pain caused by spinal disorders, the Spine pain&lt;i&gt;DETECT&lt;/i&gt; questionnaire (SPDQ) and its short-form version (SF-SPDQ), by modifying the Japanese version of the pain&lt;i&gt;DETECT&lt;/i&gt; questionnaire (PDQ-J), and to validate these tools.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from patients with neuropathic pain caused by spinal disorders (NeP-SD) and patients with nociceptive pain caused by joint disorders (NocP) as controls, we devised a scoring system for the SPDQ by calculating weighting coefficients for nine PDQ-J items. Simultaneously, we selected some items for the SF-SPDQ. Next, we conducted the validation study primarily using patients with a confirmed diagnosis (a multicenter study) and general patients (a web-based survey). Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), along with additional positive/negative predictive values and positive/negative likelihood ratios, were calculated to assess the diagnostic utility of these tools in each population.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data for 85 patients with NeP-SD and 45 patients with NocP were analyzed to develop the SPDQ/SF-SPDQ.

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, the incidence and mortality rates of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been steadily increasing in young women but not in men. Environmental variables that contribute to cardiovascular events in women remain ill-defined.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2199 consecutive patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 25.8% women, mean age 62.6±12.4 years) were admitted at the Montreal Heart Institute between June 2010 and December 2014. Snow fall exceeding 2cm/day was identified as a positive predictor for STEMI admission rates in the overall population (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07–1.48, p = 0.005), with a significant effect being seen in men (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.53, p = 0.01) but not in women (p = NS). An age-specific analysis revealed a significant increase in hospital admission rates for STEMI in younger women ≤55 years, (n = 104) during days with higher outside temperature (p = 0.004 vs men ≤55 years) and longer daylight hours (p = 0.0009 vs men ≤55 years). Accordingly, summer season, increased outside temperature and sunshine hours were identified as strong positive predictors for STEMI occurrence in women ≤55 years (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, p = 0.012, RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.007, and RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.011, respectively), while an opposite trend was observed in men ≤55 years (RR for outside temperature 0.8, 95% CI 0.73–0.95, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The impact of environmental variables on STEMI is age- and sex-dependent.

Higher temperature may play an important role in triggering such acute events in young women.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523307600000</published><title>Weather and risk of ST-elevation myocardial infarction revisited: Impact on young women</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295881v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295881v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295881v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Enterococcus faecium though commensals in human gut, few strains provide beneficial effect to humans as probiotics, few are responsible for nosocomial infection and few as non-pathogens.

A total of 640 individuals were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. Sociodemographic data, health status, history of falls and fear of falling were assessed at baseline and at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of falls at baseline was 25% as opposed to 35.2% at 24 months. The prevalence of the fear of falling was 41.5% at baseline. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between a history of falls and the fear of falling. Other factors associated with the fear of falling were female gender, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability. In total, 41.7% of the subjects who had reported a fear of falling at baseline had suffered at least one fall 24 months later. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the fear of falling was a risk factor for falls.

Nursing staff working in elderly care should not only routinely assess patients’ previous history of falls, but also evaluate their fear of falling and its associated factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522357200000</published><title>Fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults: A cause of falls, a consequence, or both?</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3</originId><published>1523516400000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04435-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mice that hit the running wheel have brainier pups than sedentary rodents do.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>6</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162ba9faec1:f26749:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523549449921</crawled><fingerprint>ca4fc227</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04435-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04435-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mice that hit the running wheel have brainier pups than sedentary rodents do.</description><engagementRate>0.05</engagementRate><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04435-3/d41586-018-04435-3_15603110.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Why fit fathers sire smarter offspring</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024450?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024450?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024450?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522812685000</published><author><name>Leandro Liborio</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b4e:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><fingerprint>f8a37a9a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Computational prediction of muon stopping sites using ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS)</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2888.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2888.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2888.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Rapid antibody production in response to invading pathogens requires the dramatic expansion of pathogen-derived antigen-specific B lymphocyte populations.

The current work examined the unique contribution that autistic traits and social anxiety have on tasks examining attention and emotion processing. In Study 1, 119 typically-developing college students completed a flanker task assessing the control of attention to target faces and away from distracting faces during emotion identification. In Study 2, 208 typically-developing college students performed a visual search task which required identification of whether a series of 8 or 16 emotional faces depicted the same or different emotions. Participants with more self-reported autistic traits performed more slowly on the flanker task in Study 1 than those with fewer autistic traits when stimuli depicted complex emotions. In Study 2, participants higher in social anxiety performed less accurately on trials showing all complex faces; participants with autistic traits showed no differences. These studies suggest that traits related to autism and to social anxiety differentially impact social cognitive processing.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Cheryl L.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The appropriate use of clinically accurate diagnostic tests is essential for the detection of pertussis, a poorly controlled vaccine-preventable disease. The purpose of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic criteria including culture, multi-target polymerase chain reaction (PCR), anti-pertussis toxin IgG (IgG-PT) serology, and the use of a clinical case definition. An additional objective was to describe the optimal timing of specimen collection for the various tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Clinical specimens were collected from patients with cough illness at seven locations across the United States between 2007 and 2011. Nasopharyngeal and blood specimens were collected from each patient during the enrollment visit. Patients who had been coughing for ≤ 2 weeks were asked to return in 2–4 weeks for collection of a second, convalescent blood specimen. Sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test were estimated using three methods—pertussis culture as the “gold standard,” composite reference standard analysis (CRS), and latent class analysis (LCA).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 868 patients were enrolled and 13.6% were &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pertussis&lt;/i&gt; positive by at least one diagnostic test. In a sample of 545 participants with non-missing data on all four diagnostic criteria, culture was 64.0% sensitive, PCR was 90.6% sensitive, and both were 100% specific by LCA. CRS and LCA methods increased the sensitivity estimates for convalescent serology and the clinical case definition over the culture-based estimates. Culture and PCR were most sensitive when performed during the first two weeks of cough; serology was optimally sensitive after the second week of cough.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Timing of specimen collection in relation to onset of illness should be considered when ordering diagnostic tests for pertussis. Consideration should be given to including IgG-PT serology as a confirmatory test in the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definition for pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Adria D.

Avian Colibacillosis is among the major causes of economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide, with a more vivid impact on developing countries. The involvement of several bacteria has made it challenging to develop effective vaccines for this disease, particularly because it is notoriously difficult to make a vaccine that contains all the contributing pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report the design and fabrication of a bacterial ghost (BG) of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80, which is among the major bacterial serotypes responsible for this disease. The generated ghost is then exploited as a homologous vaccine against Avian Colibacillosis. We demonstrate that hole formation in the cell wall of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80 can happen properly in optical densities as high as 0.8 compared to the 0.3–0.4 standard for bacteria like &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10. This is especially advantageous for mass production of this ghost which is a vital factor in development of any BG-based vaccine. Compared to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10, we faced a great challenge in transforming the wild type bacteria with the E-lysis plasmid which was probably due to higher thickness of the cell wall in O78:K80.

Avian Colibacillosis is among the major causes of economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide, with a more vivid impact on developing countries. The involvement of several bacteria has made it challenging to develop effective vaccines for this disease, particularly because it is notoriously difficult to make a vaccine that contains all the contributing pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report the design and fabrication of a bacterial ghost (BG) of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80, which is among the major bacterial serotypes responsible for this disease. The generated ghost is then exploited as a homologous vaccine against Avian Colibacillosis.

&lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; is a perennial herbaceous plant species mainly distributed in the tropics or subtropics of Asia and Africa. It has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time and now is utilized for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agriculture industries as a valued economic crop. Recently, &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; has attracted tremendous interest because of its high ceramide content. However, the breeding and genome studies are severely limited by the arduous whole genome sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, the transcriptome data of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by utilizing the high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. Based on this information, the majority of the significant genes involved in the proposed sphingolipid metabolic pathway were identified. Then, the full-length neutral ceramidase cDNA was obtained with the help of its candidate transcripts, which were acquired from the transcriptome data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this neutral ceramidase was a real ceramidase by eukaryotic expression in the yeast double knockout mutant Δypc1 Δydc1, which lacks the ceramidases—dihydroCDase (YDC1p), phytoCDase (YPC1p). In addition, the biochemical characterization of purified &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; ceramidase (AmCDase) exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an optimal activity ranging from pH 6.5 to 8.0. Based on our knowledge, this study is the first to report the related information of the neutral ceramidase in &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30–59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact. Our findings draw attention to the critical unmet need for support for caregivers of individuals with PWS.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Nathalie Kayadjanian</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194655</canonicalUrl><engagement>154</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5ed:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>f86d40e5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathalie Kayadjanian, Lauren Schwartz, Evan Farrar, Katherine Anne Comtois, Theresa V.

A sensitive and innovative assay system based on a micro-MEMS-fluxgate sensor and immunomagnetic beads-labels was developed for the rapid analysis of C-reactive proteins (CRP). The fluxgate sensor presented in this study was fabricated through standard micro-electro-mechanical system technology. A multi-loop magnetic core made of Fe-based amorphous ribbon was employed as the sensing element, and 3-D solenoid copper coils were used to control the sensing core. Antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic microbeads were strategically utilized as signal tags to label the CRP via the specific conjugation of CRP to polyclonal CRP antibodies. Separate Au film substrates were applied as immunoplatforms to immobilize CRP-beads labels through classical sandwich assays. Detection and quantification of the CRP at different concentrations were implemented by detecting the stray field of CRP labeled magnetic beads using the newly-developed micro-fluxgate sensor. The resulting system exhibited the required sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. A detection limit as low as 0.002 μg/mL CRP with a linearity range from 0.002 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL was achieved, and this suggested that the proposed biosystem possesses high sensitivity. In addition to the extremely low detection limit, the proposed method can be easily manipulated and possesses a quick response time. The response time of our sensor was less than 5 s, and the entire detection period for CRP analysis can be completed in less than 30 min using the current method. Given the detection performance and other advantages such as miniaturization, excellent stability and specificity, the proposed biosensor can be considered as a potential candidate for the rapid analysis of CRP, especially for point-of-care platforms.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Lei Guo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194631</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c47:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>f78ae144</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lei Guo, Zhen Yang, Shaotao Zhi, Zhu Feng, Chong Lei, Yong Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Contraction of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) isolated from pulmonary arterial hypertensive (PAH) and normal (non-PAH) subject lungs was determined and measured with real-time electrical impedance. Treatment of HPASMC with vasoactive peptides, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and bradykinin (BK) but not angiotensin II, induced a temporal decrease in the electrical impedance profile mirroring constrictive morphological change of the cells which typically was more robust in PAH as opposed to non-PAH cells. Inhibition with LIMKi3 and a cofilin targeted motif mimicking cell permeable peptide (MMCPP) had no effect on ET-1 induced HPASMC contraction indicating a negligible role for these actin regulatory proteins. On the other hand, a MMCPP blocking the activity of caldesmon reduced ET-1 promoted contraction pointing to a regulatory role of this protein and its activation pathway in HPASMC contraction. Inhibition of this MEK/ERK/p90RSK pathway, which is an upstream regulator of caldesmon phosphorylation, reduced ET-1 induced cell contraction. While the regulation of ET-1 induced cell contraction was found to be similar in PAH and non-PAH cells, a key difference was the response to pharmacological inhibitors and to siRNA knockdown of Rho kinases (ROCK1/ROCK2). The PAH cells required much higher concentrations of inhibitors to abrogate ET-1 induced contractions and their contraction was not affected by siRNA against either ROCK1 or ROCK2. Lastly, blocking of L-type and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels had no effect on ET-1 or BK induced contraction. However, inhibiting the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase blunted ET-1 and BK induced HPASMC contraction in both PAH and non-PAH derived HPASMC. In summary, our findings here together with previous communications illustrate similarities and differences in the regulation PAH and non-PAH smooth muscle cell contraction relating to calcium translocation, RhoA/ROCK signaling and the activity of caldesmon. These findings may provide useful tools in achieving the regulation of the vascular hypercontractility taking place in PAH.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Jamie L.

Often these transcripts are processed (spliced, capped, polyadenylated) and some are known to have important biological functions. However, most lncRNAs have unknown or poorly understood functions. Nevertheless, because of their potential role in cancer, lncRNAs are receiving a lot of attention, and the need for computational tools to predict their possible mechanisms of action is more than ever. Fundamentally, most of the known lncRNA mechanisms involve RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions. Through accurate predictions of each kind of interaction and integration of these predictions, it is possible to elucidate potential mechanisms for a given lncRNA. Approach: Here we introduce MechRNA, a pipeline for corroborating RNA-RNA interaction prediction and protein binding prediction for identifying possible lncRNA mechanisms involving specific targets or on a transcriptome-wide scale. The first stage uses a version of IntaRNA2 with added functionality for efficient prediction of RNA-RNA interactions with very long input sequences, allowing for large-scale analysis of lncRNA interactions with little or no loss of optimality. The second stage integrates protein binding information pre-computed by GraphProt, for both the lncRNA and the target. The final stage involves inferring the most likely mechanism for each lncRNA/target pair. This is achieved by generating candidate mechanisms from the predicted interactions, the relative locations of these interactions and correlation data, followed by selection of the most likely mechanistic explanation using a combined p-value. Results: We applied MechRNA on a number of recently identified cancer-related lncRNAs (PCAT1, PCAT29, ARLnc1) and also on two well-studied lncRNAs (PCA3 and 7SL). This led to the identification of hundreds of high confidence potential targets for each lncRNA and corresponding mechanisms. These predictions include the known competitive mechanism of 7SL with HuR for binding on the tumor suppressor TP53, as well as mechanisms expanding what is known about PCAT1 and ARLn1 and their targets BRCA2 and AR, respectively. For PCAT1-BRCA2, the mechanism involves competitive binding with HuR, which we confirmed using HuR immunoprecipitation assays.</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>Gawronski, A.

In recent years, acupuncture has gained in popularity worldwide. However, recent epidemiological studies are lacking. We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p&amp;lt;0.001).

In recent years, acupuncture has gained in popularity worldwide. However, recent epidemiological studies are lacking. We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients who were female, were middle-aged, resided in highly urbanized areas and suffered from injury or disorders of the musculoskeletal system were prone to more frequent acupuncture use. Our study revealed that the utilization of acupuncture became increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. Our findings may provide useful information for clinical practice and research as well as for health policy decision making.</description><published>1523394000000</published><title>Trends in use of acupuncture among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011: A nationwide population-based study</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194874</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194874</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194874</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gilberto A.

Despite an increase in dengue outbreaks and the arrival of chikungunya and Zika disease in Panama, studies on the demographic history of the invasive &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes that are the principle vectors of these diseases are still lacking in this region. Here, we assess the genetic diversity of these mosquitoes in order to decipher their invasion histories into the Isthmus of Panama. DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene obtained from 30 localities in 10 provinces confirmed the presence of more than one mitochondrial haplogroup (i.e., maternal lineage) in each species. The invasion of &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was likely from temperate European countries, as the most frequent and widespread haplogroup in Panama harbored variants that are uncommon elsewhere in the Americas. Two infrequent and geographically restricted &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; haplotypes appear to have subsequently invaded Panama from neighboring Costa Rica and the USA, respectively. In addition, we recovered two deeply divergent mitochondrial clades in Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. The geographic origins of these clades is unknown, given that divergence in the mitochondrial genome is probably due to ancient population processes within the native range of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;, rather than due to its global expansion out of Africa. However, Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mitochondrial sequences within the first clade were closely related to others from Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico and the USA, suggesting two separate invasions from Western Hemisphere source populations. The pattern of increased genetic diversity in &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes in Panama is likely facilitated by the numerous land and water inter-connections across the country, which allows them to enter via sea- and land-transportation from Europe, North, Central and South America.

One of the more fundamental health policy questions is the relationship between health care quality and spending. A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46).

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Paraquat poisoning can result in dysfunction of multiple organs, and pulmonary fibrosis with respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality. For terminally ill patients, some life-prolonging treatments can be non-beneficial treatments (NBT). The objective of this study was to determine if intubation is a NBT for patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study included 68 patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning. Patients were hospitalized at MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taitung Branch, Taiwan, between 2005 to April 2016. Composite outcomes of intra-hospital mortality, the rate of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, prescribed medications, length of stay, and medical costs were recorded and compared between the do-not-intubate (DNI) group and endotracheal intubation (EI) group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Intra-hospital mortality rate for the entire population was 100%. There were significantly more patients with DNR orders in the DNI group (P = 0.007). There were no differences in the length of hospital stay.

For terminally ill patients, some life-prolonging treatments can be non-beneficial treatments (NBT). The objective of this study was to determine if intubation is a NBT for patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study included 68 patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning. Patients were hospitalized at MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taitung Branch, Taiwan, between 2005 to April 2016. Composite outcomes of intra-hospital mortality, the rate of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, prescribed medications, length of stay, and medical costs were recorded and compared between the do-not-intubate (DNI) group and endotracheal intubation (EI) group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Intra-hospital mortality rate for the entire population was 100%. There were significantly more patients with DNR orders in the DNI group (P = 0.007). There were no differences in the length of hospital stay. However, patients in DNI group had significantly less vasopressor use and more morphine use, shorter time in the intensive care unit, and fewer medical costs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The procedure of intubation in patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning can be considered inappropriate life-prolonging treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522270800000</published><title>Is endotracheal intubation a non-beneficial treatment in patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning?</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04169-2</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04169-2</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04169-2</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t dismiss citations to journals not published in English &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t dismiss citations to journals not published in English , Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04169-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04169-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Don’t dismiss citations to journals not published in English</content></content><published>1523430000000</published><author><name>Vladimir S.

Two plasma devices at atmospheric pressure (air dielectric barrier discharge and helium plasma jet) have been used to study the early germination of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; seeds during the first days. Then, plasma activated waters are used during the later stage of plant development and growth until 42 days. The effects on both testa and endospserm ruptures during the germination stage are significant in the case of air plasma due to its higher energy and efficiency of producing reactive oxygen species than the case of helium plasma. The latter has shown distinct effects only for testa rupture. Analysis of germination stimulations are based on specific stainings for reactive oxygen species production, peroxidase activity and also membrane permeability tests. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown a smoother seed surface for air plasma treated seeds that can explain the plasma induced-germination. During the growth stage, plants were watered using 4 kinds of water (tap and deionized waters activated or not by the low temperature plasma jet). With regards to other water kinds, the characterization of the tap water has shown a larger conductivity, acidity and concentration of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Only the tap water activated by the plasma jet has shown a significant effect on the plant growth. This effect could be correlated to reactive nitrogen species such as nitrite/nitrate species present in plasma activated tap water.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Maxime Bafoil</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195512</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715291:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>fa5a3ed9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maxime Bafoil, Achraf Jemmat, Yves Martinez, Nofel Merbahi, Olivier Eichwald, Christophe Dunand, Mohammed Yousfi&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To explore the relation between cigarette smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness at first diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients diagnosed with urinary bladder cancer (BC) between 1995–2011 under the age of 75 years were retrospectively identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and invited for a study on genetic and lifestyle risk factors for BC. Information on patients’ self-reported smoking history was retrieved by means of a postal questionnaire. Tumors were stratified regarding the risk of progression defined by tumor stage and grade. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the relation between smoking intensity and aggressiveness of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The UBC study population comprised 323 (17.4%) never smokers, 870 (46.8%) former cigarette smokers, and 630 (33.9%) current cigarette smokers. A higher smoking amount was a risk factor of getting high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) compared with low-risk NMIBC in ever and former cigarette smokers (OR: 1.02 per cigarette smoked, 95% CI: 1.00–1.03 and OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.05, respectively). A statistically significant dose-response increase in the risk of a more aggressive cancer type (high-risk NMIBC and MIBC) was observed with increasing smoking duration among former smokers (p for trend 0.035 and 0.008, respectively). No significant association of the evaluated smoking intensity variables was observed in current smokers. A longer time of smoking cessation correlated with a lower odds of a more aggressive cancer.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;We observed a weak increase in the risk of a more aggressive tumor type with increasing smoking intensity in former smokers, but this association was absent in current smokers.This conflicting result may suggest that there is no strong relation between smoking intensity and bladder cancer aggressiveness. Analyses of prospective studies with longitudinal smoking assessment may provide a more definitive answer to the research question.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>André L.

Using in-field bioreactors, we investigated the influence of exogenous microorganisms in groundwater planktonic and biofilm microbial communities as part of the Integrated Field Research Challenge (IFRC). After an acclimation period with source groundwater, bioreactors received either filtered (0.22 μM filter) or unfiltered well groundwater in triplicate and communities were tracked routinely for 23 days after filtration was initiated. To address geochemical influences, the planktonic phase was assayed periodically for protein, organic acids, physico-/geochemical measurements and bacterial community (via 16S rRNA gene sequencing), while biofilms (i.e. microbial growth on sediment coupons) were targeted for bacterial community composition at the completion of the experiment (23 d). Based on Bray-Curtis distance, planktonic bacterial community composition varied temporally and between treatments (filtered, unfiltered bioreactors). Notably, filtration led to an increase in the dominant genus, &lt;i&gt;Zoogloea&lt;/i&gt; relative abundance over time within the planktonic community, while remaining relatively constant when unfiltered. At day 23, biofilm communities were more taxonomically and phylogenetically diverse and substantially different from planktonic bacterial communities; however, the biofilm bacterial communities were similar regardless of filtration. These results suggest that although planktonic communities were sensitive to groundwater filtration, bacterial biofilm communities were stable and resistant to filtration. Bioreactors are useful tools in addressing questions pertaining to microbial community assembly and succession. These data provide a first step in understanding how an extrinsic factor, such as a groundwater inoculation and flux of microbial colonizers, impact how microbial communities assemble in environmental systems.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Geoff A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Whether metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals are at increased risk of ischemic stroke is not well known. We investigated the association of the MHO phenotype with ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 354,083 adults (age 45.8 ± 14.2 years) from the Korean National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort enrolled in 2004–2008 were followed-up for incident ischemic stroke until 2013. Subjects meeting none of the metabolic syndrome criteria were classified as ‘metabolically healthy’. The cohort was categorized into four groups according to obesity and metabolic status: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), MHO, and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke was newly diagnosed in 4,884 (1.4%) individuals during a mean follow-up of 7.4 ± 1.5 years. Stroke incidence rates for the MHNW, MUNW, MHO, and MUO groups were 0.56, 2.61, 0.61, and 2.76 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. While risk for stroke increased significantly in metabolically unhealthy groups, it was not increased in MHO compared to the MHNW group on multivariate analysis. In metabolically healthy individuals, obesity did not increase the risk for ischemic stroke, regardless of the severity of obesity. Meanwhile, in metabolically unhealthy individuals, being obese was significantly associated with increased risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MHO individuals were not at increased risk for ischemic stroke. However, obesity increased risk for ischemic stroke in persons with metabolic risk factors; therefore, maintaining normal weight may be more important for this population. Also, metabolic unhealthiness showed greater association than obesity with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Hyun-Jung Lee</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195210</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c58:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>10bf2e49</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyun-Jung Lee, Eue-Keun Choi, Seung-Hwan Lee, Yong-Jin Kim, Kyung-Do Han, Seil Oh&lt;/p&gt;

Although anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is considered a successful procedure in restoring knee stability, few studies have addressed the issue of aerobic capacity after ACL surgery. Soccer players need technical, tactical and physical skills to succeed, such as good knee function and aerobic capacity. Our purpose is to evaluate aerobic fitness in ACL injured professional football players and six months after ACL reconstruction compared to a control group. Twenty athletes with ACL injury were evaluated and underwent ACL reconstruction with hamstrings autograft, and were compared to twenty healthy professional soccer players. The methods used to evaluate aerobic fitness were maximum oxygen uptake (VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt;) and ventilatory thresholds with a treadmill protocol, before and six months after surgery, compared to a control group. Knee function questionnaires, isokinetic strength testing and body composition evaluation were also performed. Results: Median ACL-injured patients age was 21 years old, and controls 20.5 years old. (n.s.). Preoperative VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt; in the ACL injured group was 45.2 ± 4.3 mL/kg/min, postoperative 48.9 ± 3.8 mL/kg/min and controls 56.9 ± 4.2 mL/kg/min. (p&amp;lt; .001 in all comparisons). Body composition evaluation was similar in all situations. Knee function questionnaires and quadriceps peak torque deficit improved after surgery but were significantly lower compared to controls. Conclusion: Aerobic fitness is significantly reduced in professional soccer players with ACL injury, and six months of rehabilitation was not enough to restore aerobic function after ACL reconstruction, compared to non-injured players of the same level.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Adriano Marques de Almeida</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194432</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123928:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>df2a2d4c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adriano Marques de Almeida, Paulo Roberto Santos Silva, André Pedrinelli, Arnaldo J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Trauma is a global burden of disease and one of the main causes of death worldwide. Therefore, many countries around the world have implemented a wide range of different initiatives to minimize mortality rates after trauma. One of these initiatives is the bundling of treatment expertise in trauma centers and the establishment of trauma networks.Germany has a decentralized system of trauma care medical centers. Severely injured patients ought to receive adequate treatment in both level I and level II centers. This study investigated the effectiveness of a decentralized network and the question whether level I and level II centers have comparable patient outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;In 2009, the first trauma network DGU&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; in Germany was certified in the rural area of Eastern Bavaria. All patients admitted to the 25 participating hospitals were prospectively included in this network in the framework of a study sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research between March 2012 and February 2014. 2 hospitals were level I centers (maximal care centers), 8 hospitals were level II centers, and 15 hospitals were level III centers. The criterion for study inclusion was an injury severity score (ISS) ≥ 16 for patients´ primarily admitted to a level I or a level II center. Exclusion criteria were transferal to another hospital within 48 h, an unknown revised injury severity classification II score (RISC II), or primary admittance to a level III center (n = 52). 875 patients were included in the study.Univariate analyses were used regarding the preclinical and clinical parameters, the primary endpoint mortality rate, and the secondary endpoints length of stay, organ failure, and neurological outcome (GOS). The primary endpoint was additionally evaluated by means of multivariable analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Indices for injury severity (GCS, AIS&lt;sub&gt;Head&lt;/sub&gt;, ISS, and NISS) as well as the predicted probability of death (RISC II) were higher in level I centers than in level II centers.No significant differences were found between the mortality rate of the unadjusted analysis [level I: 21.6% (CI: 16.5, 27.9), level II: 18.1% (CI: 14.4, 22.5), p = 0.28] and that of the adjusted analysis [level I SMR: 0.94 (CI: 0.72, 1.21), level II SMR: 1.18 (CI 0.95, 1.48) SMR: expected vs. calculated mortality rate according to RISC II]. Multivariable analysis showed a survival advantage of patients admitted to a level I center with a probability of death of 13% (RISC II). The number need to treat was 10 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that a rural trauma network with centralized and local structures may achieve equivalent results with regard to mortality rates to those obtained in level I and level II centers. These results were furthered by a certain preclinical centralization (24/7 air rescue) of patients. The study also showed a survival advantage of patients admitted to a level I center with a probability of death of 13%.

Preclinical and initial clinical evaluation with regard to probable mortality rates should be further improved to identify patients who would benefit from admittance to a level I center.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521061200000</published><title>A trauma network with centralized and local health care structures: Evaluating the effectiveness of the first certified Trauma Network of the German Society of Trauma Surgery</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6</originId><published>1521529200000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 Years Ago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 &amp;amp;amp; 100 Years Ago, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03274-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 Years Ago</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16243bba5ea:2eaad63:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521554793962</crawled><fingerprint>245c509b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 Years Ago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 &amp;amp;amp; 100 Years Ago, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03274-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 Years Ago</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>50 &amp; 100 Years Ago</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194682</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194682</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194682</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Gbogbo, Anna Arthur-Yartel, Josephine A.

Background &lt;p&gt;The need to evaluate the human health safety of fishery resources remain urgent in the mist of the ever-increasing fear of heavy metal toxicity from the consumption of Ghana’s fisheries resource, as a consequence of pollution from several anthropogenic activities including artisanal gold mining. Nevertheless, the bigeye grunt (&lt;i&gt;Brachydeuterus auritus&lt;/i&gt;) and Bagrid catfish (&lt;i&gt;Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt;) remain commercially valuable fish species in West Africa and continue to attract high patronage.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Forty-five specimens each of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; collected from the Weija Dam and the Tema Fishing Habour in Ghana, between June and September 2016, were analysed for seven heavy metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Lead and Cadmium were below detection in all samples while Cu was not detected in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;.

These constraints provide, in principle, only upper limits to the distance between amino acid residues along the surface of the biomolecule. In practice, attempts to use of XLMS constraints for tertiary protein structure determination have not been widely successful. This indicates the need of specifically designed strategies for the representation of these constraints within modeling algorithms. Here, a force-field designed to represent XLMS-derived constraints is proposed. The potential energy functions are obtained by computing, in the database of known protein structures, the probability of satisfaction of a topological cross-linking distance as a function of the Euclidean distance between amino acid residues.

These constraints provide, in principle, only upper limits to the distance between amino acid residues along the surface of the biomolecule. In practice, attempts to use of XLMS constraints for tertiary protein structure determination have not been widely successful. This indicates the need of specifically designed strategies for the representation of these constraints within modeling algorithms. Here, a force-field designed to represent XLMS-derived constraints is proposed. The potential energy functions are obtained by computing, in the database of known protein structures, the probability of satisfaction of a topological cross-linking distance as a function of the Euclidean distance between amino acid residues. The force-field can be easily incorporated into current modeling methods and software. In this work, the force-field was implemented within the Rosetta ab initio relax protocol.

Background &lt;p&gt;Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most prevalent congenital infection acquired worldwide, with higher incidence in developing countries and among HIV-exposed children. Less is known regarding vertical transmission of parvovirus B19 (B19V) and enterovirus (EV). We aimed to assess the prevalence of CMV, B19V and EV vertical transmission and compare results of screening of congenital CMV obtained from two different specimens in a semirural Mozambican maternity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant mothers attending Manhiça District Hospital upon delivery. Information on maternal risk factors was ascertained. Dried umbilical cord (DUC) samples were collected in filter paper for CMV, B19V and EV detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) to test for CMV by RT-PCR. Maternal blood samples and placental biopsy samples were also obtained to investigate CMV maternal serology, HIV status and immunopathology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From September 2014 to January 2015, 118 mothers/newborn pairs were recruited. Prevalence of maternal HIV infection was 31.4% (37/118). CMV RT-PCR was positive in 3/115 (2.6%) of DUC samples and in 3/96 (6.3%) of NPA samples obtained from neonates. The concordance of the RT-PCR assay through DUC with their correspondent NPA sample was moderate (Kappa = 0.42 and p&amp;lt;0.001. No differences on cCMV prevalence were found among HIV-exposed and unexposed. All (100%) mothers were seropositive for CMV IgG. RT-PCR of EV and B19V in DUC were both negative in all screened cases.

Background &lt;p&gt;Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most prevalent congenital infection acquired worldwide, with higher incidence in developing countries and among HIV-exposed children. Less is known regarding vertical transmission of parvovirus B19 (B19V) and enterovirus (EV). We aimed to assess the prevalence of CMV, B19V and EV vertical transmission and compare results of screening of congenital CMV obtained from two different specimens in a semirural Mozambican maternity.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant mothers attending Manhiça District Hospital upon delivery. Information on maternal risk factors was ascertained. Dried umbilical cord (DUC) samples were collected in filter paper for CMV, B19V and EV detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) to test for CMV by RT-PCR. Maternal blood samples and placental biopsy samples were also obtained to investigate CMV maternal serology, HIV status and immunopathology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From September 2014 to January 2015, 118 mothers/newborn pairs were recruited. Prevalence of maternal HIV infection was 31.4% (37/118). CMV RT-PCR was positive in 3/115 (2.6%) of DUC samples and in 3/96 (6.3%) of NPA samples obtained from neonates. The concordance of the RT-PCR assay through DUC with their correspondent NPA sample was moderate (Kappa = 0.42 and p&amp;lt;0.001. No differences on cCMV prevalence were found among HIV-exposed and unexposed. All (100%) mothers were seropositive for CMV IgG. RT-PCR of EV and B19V in DUC were both negative in all screened cases. No histological specific findings were found in placental tissues. No risk factors associated to vertical transmission of these viral infections were found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study indicates the significant occurrence of vertical transmission of CMV in southern Mozambique. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the true burden, clinical relevance and consequences of congenital infections with such pathogens in resource-constrained settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521061200000</published><title>Congenital cytomegalovirus, parvovirus and enterovirus infection in Mozambican newborns at birth: A cross-sectional survey</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03502-7</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03502-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/o8hRSRPUbKc/s41467-018-03502-7</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Voltage gating of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voltage gating of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03502-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03502-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;PIEZO proteins form mechanosensitive ion channels.

Background &lt;p&gt;The WHO recommends maternity waiting homes (MWH) as one intervention to improve maternal and newborn health. However, persistent structural, cultural and financial barriers in their design and implementation have resulted in mixed success in both their uptake and utilization. Guidance is needed on how to design a MWH intervention that is acceptable and sustainable. Using formative research and guided by a sustainability framework for health programs, we systematically collected data from key stakeholders and potential users in order to design a MWH intervention in Zambia that could overcome multi-dimensional barriers to accessing facility delivery, be acceptable to the community and be financially and operationally sustainable.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We used a concurrent triangulation study design and mixed methods. We used free listing to gather input from a total of 167 randomly sampled women who were pregnant or had a child under the age of two (n = 59), men with a child under the age of two (n = 53), and community elders (n = 55) living in the catchment areas of four rural health facilities in Zambia. We conducted 17 focus group discussions (n = 135) among a purposive sample of pregnant women (n = 33), mothers-in-law (n = 32), traditional birth attendants or community maternal health promoters (n = 38), and men with a child under two (n = 32). We administered 38 semi-structured interviews with key informants who were identified by free list respondents as having a stake in the condition and use of MWHs. Lastly, we projected fixed and variable recurrent costs for operating a MWH.Respondents most frequently mentioned distance, roads, transport, and the quality of MWHs and health facilities as the major problems facing pregnant women in their communities. They also cited inadequate advanced planning for delivery and the lack of access to delivery supplies and baby clothes as other problems. Respondents identified the main problems of MWHs specifically as over-crowding, poor infrastructure, lack of amenities, safety concerns, and cultural issues. To support operational sustainability, community members were willing to participate on oversight committees and contribute labor. The annual fixed recurrent cost per 10-bed MWH was estimated as USD543, though providing food and charcoal added another $3,000USD. Respondents identified water pumps, an agriculture shop, a shop for baby clothes and general goods, and grinding mills as needs in their communities that could potentially be linked with an MWH for financial sustainability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings informed the development of an intervention model for renovating existing MWH or constructing new MWH that meets community standards of safety, comfort and services offered and is aligned with government policies related to facility construction, ownership, and access to health services. The basic strategies of the new MWH model include improving community acceptability, strengthening governance and accountability, and building upon existing efforts to foster financial and operational sustainability. The proposed model addresses the problems cited by our respondents and challenges to MWHs identified by in previous studies and elicits opportunities for social enterprises that could serve the dual purpose of meeting a community need and generating revenue for the MWH.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Nancy A.

These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K inhibitor resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1520963427000</published><title>Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00117</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>156</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00117/20180403/images/medium/mp-2018-00117u_0008.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00117</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/a5ZgFN3h-Bs/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00117</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522814400000</published><author><name>Kaisa Rautaniemi, Elina Vuorimaa-Laukkanen, Clare J.

Many catabolic stimuli, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) in combination with oncostatin M (OSM), promote cartilage breakdown via the induction of collagen-degrading collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;MMP1&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; in human articular chondrocytes. Indeed, joint diseases with an inflammatory component are characterised by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) catabolism. Importantly, protein kinase C (PKC) signalling has a primary role in cytokine-induced &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt; expression, and is known to regulate cellular functions associated with pathologies involving ECM remodelling. At present, substrates downstream of PKC remain undefined. Herein, we show that both IL-1- and OSM-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) in human chondrocytes is strongly associated with signalling via the atypical PKCι isoform. Consequently, inhibiting PKD activation with a pan-PKD inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Specific gene silencing of the PKD isoforms revealed that only PKD3 (&lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt;) depletion mirrored the observed &lt;i&gt;MMP&lt;/i&gt; repression, indicative of the pharmacological inhibitor specifically affecting only this isoform. &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing was also shown to reduce serine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as phosphorylation of all three mitogen-activated protein kinase groups. This altered signalling following &lt;i&gt;PRKD3&lt;/i&gt; silencing led to a significant reduction in the expression of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) genes &lt;i&gt;FOS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JUN&lt;/i&gt;, critical for the induction of many MMPs including &lt;i&gt;MMP1/13&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the AP-1 factor activating transcription factor 3 (&lt;i&gt;ATF3&lt;/i&gt;) was also reduced concomitant with the observed reduction in &lt;i&gt;MMP13&lt;/i&gt; expression.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness which is ultimately fatal, most often due to involvement of the diaphragm. Macrophage infiltration of dystrophic muscles has been strongly linked to muscle damage and fibrosis in DMD. We hypothesized that cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual chemokine receptor (CCR2/CCR5) antagonist currently under clinical evaluation for other diseases, could prevent macrophage accumulation and blunt disease progression in the diaphragms of mdx mice (genetic homologue of DMD). Treatment with CVC (20 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally) or vehicle was initiated in mdx mice at 2 weeks of age (prior to the onset of muscle necrosis) and continued for 4 weeks. Flow cytometry to assess inflammatory cell subsets as well as histological and force generation parameters were determined in mdx diaphragms at the conclusion of the treatment. CVC therapy induced a major (3.9-fold) reduction in total infiltrating macrophages, whereas total numbers of neutrophils and T lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+) were unaffected. No changes in macrophage polarization status (inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory skewing based on iNOS and CD206 expression) were observed. Muscle fiber size and fibrosis were not altered by CVC, whereas a significant reduction in centrally nucleated fibers was found suggesting a decrease in prior necrosis-regeneration cycles. In addition, maximal isometric force production by the diaphragm was increased by CVC therapy. These results suggest that CVC or other chemokine receptor antagonists which reduce pathological macrophage infiltration may have the potential to slow disease progression in DMD.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Feng Liang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194421</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>84e6d150</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Feng Liang, Christian Giordano, Dong Shang, Qian Li, Basil J.

These results suggest that CVC or other chemokine receptor antagonists which reduce pathological macrophage infiltration may have the potential to slow disease progression in DMD.</description><published>1521666000000</published><title>The dual CCR2/CCR5 chemokine receptor antagonist Cenicriviroc reduces macrophage infiltration and disease severity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Dmd&amp;lt;sup&gt;mdx-4Cv&amp;lt;/sup&gt;) mice</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ah-Ra Lyu, Dong Hyun Kim, Seung Hun Lee, Dong-Sik Shin, Sun-Ae Shin, Yong-Ho Park&lt;/p&gt;
Preservation of residual hearing after cochlear implant is an important issue with regards to hearing performance. Various methods of steroid administration have been widely used in clinical practice to reduce inflammation and preserve residual hearing. Here we compare the effect of different routes of dexamethasone administration on intracochlear inflammation and residual hearing in guinea pig ears. Dexamethasone was delivered into the guinea pigs either through intracochlear, intratympanic or systemic route. The intracochlear concentration of dexamethasone, residual hearing, inflammatory cytokines and histopathologic changes were evaluated over time. A higher intracochlear dexamethasone concentration was observed after intracochlear administration than through the other routes. Residual hearing was better preserved with local dexamethasone administration as was supported by the reduced inflammatory cytokines, more hair cell survival and less severe intracochlear fibrosis and ossification concurrently seen in the local delivery group than in the systemic group. The results demonstrate that local dexamethasone delivery can reduce intracochlear inflammation and preserve residual hearing better than in systemically administered dexamethasone.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Ah-Ra Lyu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c59:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>7d78ed53</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ah-Ra Lyu, Dong Hyun Kim, Seung Hun Lee, Dong-Sik Shin, Sun-Ae Shin, Yong-Ho Park&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of this study was to explore the factors influencing low birth rate among married women using the National Survey data in Korea. We compared the different influences on women’s first and subsequent childbirths. This study was a secondary analysis using the “National Survey on Fertility and Family Health and Welfare”, which was a nationally representative survey conducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. We analyzed the data of 3,482 married women (aged between 19 and 39 years) using SPSS 20.0 program for descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way ANOVA, and binary and ordinal logistic regression models. The factors influencing women’s first childbirth included perceptions about the value of marriage and children and their education level. The factors influencing their subsequent childbirths included multifaceted variables of maternal age during the first childbirth, residential area, religion, monthly household income, perceptions about the value of marriage and children, and social media. It is necessary to improve women’s awareness and positive perceptions about marriage and children in order to increase the birth rate in Korea. Moreover, consistently providing financial and political support for maternal and childcare concerns and using social media to foster more positive attitudes toward having children may enhance birth rates in the future.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Ju-Eun Song</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194597</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37b5:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>ba525c0c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ju-Eun Song, Jeong-Ah Ahn, Sun-Kyoung Lee, Eun Ha Roh&lt;/p&gt;

The IL-1 cytokine family includes eleven members, among which Il-36α, β and γ, IL-36Ra and IL-38. The IL-36 cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-38 is also expressed in the skin and was previously proposed to act as an IL-36 antagonist. In this study, we thus examined expression and function of Il-38 in a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin inflammation. &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA was detected in the epidermis and in primary mouse keratinocytes, but not in dermal fibroblasts. At the peak of IMQ-induced inflammation, skin &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels were reduced, whereas &lt;i&gt;Il-36ra&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression increased. The severity of IMQ-induced skin inflammation, as assessed by recording ear thickness and histological changes, was similar in Il-38 KO and WT littermate control mice, while, in contrast, Il-36ra-deficient mice displayed more severe skin pathology than their WT littermates. Il-38-deficiency had no impact on IMQ-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators in the skin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, on the basal expression of various cytokines or chemokines by cultured primary keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, or on the response of these cells to Il-36β. Finally, after cessation of topical IMQ application, the resolution of skin inflammation was also not altered in Il-38 KO mice. In conclusion, Il-38-deficiency did not impact the development or resolution of IMQ-induced skin inflammation. Our observations further suggest that endogenous Il-38 does not exert Il-36 inhibitory activity in this model, or in cultured skin cells. A potential anti-inflammatory function of Il-38 in mouse skin thus still remains to be demonstrated.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Jennifer Palomo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194667</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f8904:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>4d0ec072</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Palomo, Sabina Troccaz, Dominique Talabot-Ayer, Emiliana Rodriguez, Gaby Palmer&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;In 2009, the Western Australian (WA) Government introduced the Four-Hour Rule (FHR) program. The policy stated that most patients presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) were to be seen and either admitted, transferred, or discharged within 4 hours. This study utilised de-identified data from five participating hospitals, before and after FHR implementation, to assess the impact of the FHR on several areas of ED functioning.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A state (WA) population-based intervention study design, using longitudinal data obtained from administrative health databases via record linkage methodology, and interrupted time series analysis technique.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;There were 3,214,802 ED presentations, corresponding to 1,203,513 ED patients.After the FHR implementation, access block for patients admitted through ED for all five sites showed a significant reduction of up to 13.2% (Rate Ratio 0.868, 95%CI 0.814, 0.925) per quarter. Rate of ED attendances for most hospitals continued to rise throughout the entire study period and were unaffected by the FHR, except for one hospital. Pattern of change in ED re-attendance rate post-FHR was similar to pre-FHR, but the trend reduced for two hospitals. ED occupancy was reduced by 6.2% per quarter post-FHR for the most ‘crowded’ ED. ED length of stay and ED efficiency improved in four hospitals and deteriorated in one hospital. Time to being seen by ED clinician and Did-Not-Wait rate improved for some hospitals. Admission rates in post-FHR increased, by up to 1% per quarter, for two hospitals where the pre-FHR trend was decreasing.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The FHR had a consistent effect on ‘flow’ measures: significantly reducing ED overcrowding and access block and enhancing ED efficiency. Time-based outcome measures mostly improved with the FHR. There is some evidence of increased ED attendance, but no evidence of increased ED re-attendance. Effects on patient disposition status were mixed. Overall, this reflects the value of investing resources into the ED/hospital system to improve efficiency and patient experience. Further research is required to illuminate the exact mechanisms of the effects of FHR on the ED and hospital functioning across Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Hanh Ngo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193902</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9fb:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>dc855d44</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanh Ngo, Roberto Forero, David Mountain, Daniel Fatovich, Wing Nicola Man, Peter Sprivulis, Mohammed Mohsin, Sam Toloo, Antonio Celenza, Gerard Fitzgerald, Sally McCarthy, Ken Hillman, on behalf of the Four-Hour Rule Partnership Grant &lt;/p&gt;

To ensure optimal calcium accrual in the fetal skeleton, a substantial rise occurs in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D), but is dependent on sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D). Large longitudinal studies addressing free 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D during pregnancy are scarce. We aimed to assess levels of and relationship between 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and free 25(OH)D during pregnancy; determinants of vitamin D status; and association between vitamin D indices or PTH and pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes mellitus and birthweight). Altogether 855 pregnant Norwegian Caucasian women from Trondheim and Stavanger (latitude 63°N and 58°N) were recruited; 94 were lost to follow-up. The study was originally a randomized controlled trial (2007–2009) with gestational diabetes as primary outcome. Data were collected in second and third trimester. In third trimester, 246 (34%) had vitamin D insufficiency and 52 (7%) deficiency (25(OH)D &amp;lt;50 and &amp;lt;30nmol/L, respectively). During wintertime in third trimester, 61 (47%) from Trondheim and 23 (51%) from Stavanger exhibited vitamin D insufficiency. PTH was elevated in 27 (3.7%). Estimate of change between trimesters was (95% CI): 25(OH)D -1.8 (-2.8 to -0.7) nmol/L, DBP 0.62 (0.57 to 0.66) μmol/L, calculated free 25(OH)D -1.7 (-2.0 to -1.4) pmol/L, PTH 0.81 (0.72 to 0.90) pmol/L, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D (sub-analysis) 31.4 (CI 24.7 to 38.2) pmol/L. A decrease in 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D occurred in 45% of those with vitamin D deficiency, and they also exhibited lower levels than women with adequate vitamin D status. No association of vitamin D indices and PTH with pregnancy outcomes was observed. Women in Trondheim displayed lower 25(OH)D levels, despite minor latitudinal differences. Less than one-fifth adhered to the authorities’ vitamin D recommendations. These findings demonstrate that hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among pregnant women living in northern latitudes, especially during the dark season, and there is an unmet need to ensure adequate vitamin D intake.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Miriam K.

The natural alkaloid berberine has been ascribed numerous health benefits including lipid and cholesterol reduction and improved insulin sensitivity in diabetics. However, oral (PO) administration of berberine is hindered by poor bioavailability and increasing dose often elicits gastro-intestinal side effects. To overcome the caveats associated with oral berberine, we developed transdermal (TD) formulations of berberine (BBR) and the berberine precursor dihydroberberine (DHB). These formulations were compared to oral BBR using pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and general safety studies &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To complete this work, a sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated according the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods to simultaneously measure berberine, simvastatin, and simvastatin hydroxy acid with relative quantification used for the berberine metabolite demethylene berberine glucuronide (DBG). Acute pharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated a statistically relevant ranking for berberine bioavailability based upon AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-8&lt;/sub&gt; as DHB TD &gt; BBR TD &gt;&gt; BBR PO with similar ranking for the metabolite DBG, indicating that transdermal administration achieves BBR levels well above oral administration. Similarly, chronic administration (14 days) resulted in significantly higher levels of circulating BBR and DBG in DHB TD treated animals. Chronically treated rats were given a single dose of simvastatin with no observed change in the drugs bioavailability compared with control, suggesting the increased presence of BBR had no effect on simvastatin metabolism. This observation was further supported by consistent CYP3A4 expression across all treatment groups. Moreover, no changes in kidney and liver biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, were observed between treatment formats, and confirming previous reports that BBR has no effect on HMG-CoA expression. This study supports the safe use of transdermal compositions that improve on the poor bioavailability of oral berberine and have the potential to be more efficacious in the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Beth Buchanan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194979</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0ae6:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><fingerprint>2548997e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beth Buchanan, Qingfang Meng, Mathieu-Marc Poulin, Jonathan Zuccolo, Chike Godwin Azike, Joseph Gabriele, David Charles Baranowski&lt;/p&gt;

We have previously characterized Pir32, a &lt;i&gt;Candia albicans&lt;/i&gt; cell wall protein that we found to be involved in filamentation, virulence, chitin deposition, and resistance to oxidative stress. Other than defining the cell shape, the cell wall is critical for the interaction with the surrounding environment and the point of contact and interaction with the host surface. In this study, we applied tandem mass spectrometry combined with bioinformatics to investigate cell wall proteome changes in a &lt;i&gt;pir32&lt;/i&gt; null strain. A total of 16 and 25 proteins were identified exclusively in the null mutant strains grown under non-filamentous and filamentous conditions. These proteins included members of the PGA family with various functions, lipase and the protease involved in virulence, superoxide dismutases required for resisting oxidative stress, alongside proteins required for cell wall remodeling and synthesis such as Ssr1, Xog1, Dfg5 and Dcw1. In addition proteins needed for filamentation like Cdc42, Ssu81 and Ucf1, and other virulence proteins such as Als3, Rbt5, and Csa2 were also detected. The detection of these proteins in the mutant and their lack of detection in the wild type can explain the differential phenotypes previously observed.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Pamela El Khoury</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194403</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f8:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>cbcdbf50</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pamela El Khoury, Andy Awad, Brigitte Wex, Roy A.

The difference in &lt;i&gt;F. nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; expression between CRC and adjacent normal tissues was thus smaller than the original study, and not detected in most samples.</content></summary><title>Replication Study: Fusobacterium nucleatum infection is prevalent in human colorectal carcinoma</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12481</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>226</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12481/20180328/images/medium/jp-2017-12481w_0001.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12481</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/tCAzFyhqfac/acs.jpcb.7b12481</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522209600000</published><author><name>Susanne Dogan, Michael Paulus, Yury Forov, Christopher Weis, Matthias Kampmann, Christopher Cewe, Irena Kiesel, Patrick Degen, Paul Salmen, Heinz Rehage, Metin Tolan</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12481</link><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1626e53544e:507c62:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522269377614</crawled><fingerprint>3c2d457d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b12481/20180328/images/medium/jp-2017-12481w_0001.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12481&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the effects of dopaminergic interventions on pain remains questionable. This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed at exploring the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain evoked by cold stimulation and on spontaneous pain in patients with lumbar radicular (neuropathic) pain.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data was collected from 35 patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (18 men, mean age 56.2±13 years). The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In addition, apomorphine prolonged cold pain tolerance but not threshold in the painful site (from a median of 43.0 seconds (IQR = 63.0) at baseline to 51.0 seconds (IQR = 78.0) at 120 min, p = 0.02). Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>May Haddad</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195287</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4608:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>845996b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by May Haddad, Dorit Pud, Roi Treister, Erica Suzan, Elon Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Investigation of human diet during the Neolithic has often been limited to a few archaeological cultures or single sites. In order to provide insight into the development of human food consumption and husbandry strategies, our study explores bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 466 human and 105 faunal individuals from 26 sites in central Germany. It is the most extensive data set to date from an enclosed geographic microregion, covering 4,000 years of agricultural history from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The animal data show that a variety of pastures and dietary resources were explored, but that these changed remarkably little over time. In the human &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N however we found a significant increase with time across the different archaeological cultures. This trend could be observed in all time periods and archaeological cultures (Bell Beaker phenomenon excluded), even on continuously populated sites. Since there was no such trend in faunal isotope values, we were able largely to exclude manuring as the cause of this effect. Based on the rich interdisciplinary data from this region and archaeological period we can argue that meat consumption increased with the increasing duration of farming subsistence.
In &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, we could not observe any clear increasing or decreasing trends during the archaeological time periods, either for humans or for animals, which would have suggested significant changes in the environment and landscape use. We discovered sex-related dietary differences, with males of all archaeological periods having higher &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N values than females, and an age-related increasing consumption of animal protein. An initial decrease of &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-values at the age of 1–2 years reveals partial weaning, while complete weaning took place at the age of 3–4 years.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Angelina Münster</name></author><engagement>28</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f15:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>3910428</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angelina Münster, Corina Knipper, Vicky M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Pro-active case detection (Pro-ACD), in the form of voluntary screening and treatment (VSAT) following community mobilisation about ‘asymptomatic malaria’, is currently being evaluated as a tool for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; elimination in Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted to explore community understanding, perceptions, expectations and acceptability of the Pro-ACD intervention in order to identify aspects that could be improved in future Pro-ACD activities. This was ancillary to a three-round VSAT campaign, carried out in three villages between December 2015 and March 2016. Qualitative data collection began shortly after the end of the three rounds of screening. Purposive sampling was used to select participants. Nine focus group discussions with participants (n = 46) and non-participants (n = 40) in the Pro-ACD screening were conducted, in addition to in-depth interviews with key village figures (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Health promotion messages were well delivered and received, but it was difficult for many villagers to understand the messages around ‘asymptomatic malaria’. Overall, villagers and village leaders had a positive opinion about the VSAT intervention. Acceptability was high, as a direct consequence of favourable perceptions towards the screening activity: the Pro-ACD intervention was seen by the local population as an effective, inexpensive, reliable and readily available tool to protect individuals and the community from the insurgence of malaria. Physical absence and lack of time (both linked to work-related activities) were the main reasons for non-participation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although VSAT was generally well perceived and accepted, the ‘time factor’ related to the need to satisfy essential daily subsistence requirements played a significant role in determining participation in the screening. More well-adapted and meaningful Pro-ACD approaches could be implemented by improving the timing of the testing activites, and strengthening community participation and engagement to increase acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Pierluigi Taffon</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195809</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66cc:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>89db08b6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pierluigi Taffon, Gabriele Rossi, Jean-Marie Kindermans, Rafael Van den Bergh, Chea Nguon, Mark Debackere, Lieven Vernaeve, Martin De Smet, Emilie Venables&lt;/p&gt;

In the southern Bago Yoma mountain range in Myanmar, Asian elephants are being killed at a disturbing rate. This emerging crisis was identified initially through a telemetry study when 7 of 19 of collared elephants were poached within a year of being fitted with a satellite-GPS collar. Subsequent follow up of ground teams confirmed the human caused death or disappearance of at least 19 elephants, including the seven collared individuals, within a 35 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area in less than two years. The carcasses of 40 additional elephants were found in areas located across south-central Myanmar once systematic surveys began by our team and collaborators. In addition to the extreme rate of loss, this study documents the targeting of elephants for their skin instead of the more common ivory, an increasing trend in Myanmar. Intensive research programs focused on other conservation problems identified this issue and are now encouraging local authorities to prioritize anti-poaching efforts and improve conservation policies within the country. Myanmar represents one of the last remaining countries in Asia with substantial wildlands suitable for elephants. Increasing rates of human-elephant conflict and poaching events in this country pose a dire threat to the global population.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Christie Sampson</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194113</canonicalUrl><engagement>7</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d5b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>63f71916</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christie Sampson, John McEvoy, Zaw Min Oo, Aung Myo Chit, Aung Nyein Chan, David Tonkyn, Paing Soe, Melissa Songer, A.

We conducted a document analysis that explored publication ethics and authorship in the context of population biobanks from both a theoretical (e.g. normative documents) and practical (e.g. biobank-specific documentation) perspective. The aim was to provide an overview of the state of authorship attribution in population biobanks and attempt to fill the gap in discussions around the issue. Our findings demonstrate that the most common approach adopted in both the normative and biobank-specific documentation is acknowledgment. A co-authorship approach was second and highlighted concerns surrounding the fairness of imposing authorship of the scientific leadership as a condition to access data and biosamples, as well as the alignment with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ criteria such as what is deemed a significant contribution and how to ensure accountability. Based on these findings, we propose a three-prong approach, that may be cumulative, to address the issue of authorship attribution in the context of population biobanks, namely 1) the biobank should be appropriately acknowledged; 2) an invitation for co-authorship should be made based on the spirit of collaboration and provided a substantial contribution has been made; and 3) a citation/referencing option should be available.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Erika Kleiderman</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194997</canonicalUrl><engagement>2</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51da:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>6520608</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erika Kleiderman, Amy Pack, Pascal Borry, Ma’n Zawati&lt;/p&gt;

Repetitive DNA represents the major component of the genome in both plant and animal species.

The diauxic shift of Escherichia coli, growing first on glucose and, after it is exhausted, on acetate, is still today actively studied. As a fundamental example of metabolic adaptation, we are interested in understanding if diauxie in monocultures of E. coli is a coordinated and uniform metabolic shift, or rather the observable emergent result of individual sub-populations behavior. To do so we first develop a modeling framework that integrates dynamic models (ordinary differential equation systems) with structural models (metabolic networks), providing an open source modeling framework that is suitable to investigate the dynamics of microbial communities. We apply our methods to model E. coli either as having an average, unique metabolic state or as being the combination of two E. coli populations adapted to one of the two carbon sources. Our results are in strong agreement with previously published data and suggest that rather than a coordinated metabolic shift, diauxie could be the emergent pattern resulting from a survival strategy where individual cells differentiate for optimal growth on different substrates in view of environmental fluctuations. This work offers a new perspective on how to use dynamic metabolic modeling to investigate population dynamics, as the proposed approach can be easily transfered to studies on other multi-species communities as well as single cells.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Succurro, A.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/29/291492</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16274c35591:766c108:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522377381265</crawled><fingerprint>d9220bb6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><description>Microbial communities have adapted to greatly variable environments in order to survive both short-term perturbations and permanent changes.

To do so we first develop a modeling framework that integrates dynamic models (ordinary differential equation systems) with structural models (metabolic networks), providing an open source modeling framework that is suitable to investigate the dynamics of microbial communities. We apply our methods to model E. coli either as having an average, unique metabolic state or as being the combination of two E. coli populations adapted to one of the two carbon sources. Our results are in strong agreement with previously published data and suggest that rather than a coordinated metabolic shift, diauxie could be the emergent pattern resulting from a survival strategy where individual cells differentiate for optimal growth on different substrates in view of environmental fluctuations. This work offers a new perspective on how to use dynamic metabolic modeling to investigate population dynamics, as the proposed approach can be easily transfered to studies on other multi-species communities as well as single cells.</description><published>1522306800000</published><title>Emergent sub-population behavior uncovered with a community dynamic metabolic model of Escherichia coli diauxic growth [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00001</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>334</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00001/20180403/images/medium/bi-2018-00001t_0004.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00001</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/PVHAzYYDg-0/acs.biochem.8b00001</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522728000000</published><author><name>Anthony N.

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006078</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006078</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16272f1be07:b826e:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522346868231</crawled><fingerprint>35ffcce0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Dotu, Scott I.

Fungal communities in agricultural soils are assumed to be affected by soil and crop management. Our intention was to investigate the impact of different tillage and fertilization practices on fungal communities in a long-term crop rotation field trial established in 1992 in Central Germany. Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. conservation tillage, intensive &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (&lt;i&gt;Basidio&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Asco&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Zygo&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Glomero&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/i&gt;), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) substantiated the results and proved significant influences of tillage and pre-crop, while fertilization had the smallest and non-significant effect. In-depth analysis of putative phytopathogenic and plant beneficial fungal groups indicated distinct responses; for example &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; was significantly enriched in the intensively fertilized conservation tillage variants with the pre-crop maize, while &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt; displayed significant association with conventional tillage and pre-crop rapeseed. Many putative plant beneficial fungi also reacted differentially to farming practice with the most distinct responders identified among the &lt;i&gt;Glomeromycota&lt;/i&gt; (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF).</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Loreen Sommermann</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195345</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4616:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>66fa4f09</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Loreen Sommermann, Joerg Geistlinger, Daniel Wibberg, Annette Deubel, Jessica Zwanzig, Doreen Babin, Andreas Schlüter, Ingo Schellenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. conservation tillage, intensive &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (&lt;i&gt;Basidio&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Asco&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Zygo&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Glomero&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/i&gt;), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) substantiated the results and proved significant influences of tillage and pre-crop, while fertilization had the smallest and non-significant effect. In-depth analysis of putative phytopathogenic and plant beneficial fungal groups indicated distinct responses; for example &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; was significantly enriched in the intensively fertilized conservation tillage variants with the pre-crop maize, while &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt; displayed significant association with conventional tillage and pre-crop rapeseed. Many putative plant beneficial fungi also reacted differentially to farming practice with the most distinct responders identified among the &lt;i&gt;Glomeromycota&lt;/i&gt; (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF).</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>Fungal community profiles in agricultural soils of a long-term field trial under different tillage, fertilization and crop rotation conditions analyzed by high-throughput ITS-amplicon sequencing</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gal Keren-Aviram, Fabien Dachet, Shruti Bagla, Karina Balan, Jeffrey A.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is not well understood at the molecular level. Exactly why some brain regions produce epileptic discharges and others do not is not known. Patients who fail to respond to antiseizure medication (refractory epilepsy) can benefit from surgical removal of brain regions to reduce seizure frequency. The tissue removed in these surgeries offers an invaluable resource to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of human epilepsy. Here, we report a proteomic study to determine whether there are common proteomic patterns in human brain regions that produce epileptic discharges. We analyzed human brain samples, as part of the Systems Biology of Epilepsy Project (SBEP). These brain pieces are &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized human brain samples withdrawn from the neocortex of six patients with refractory epilepsy. This study is unique in that for each of these six patients the comparison of protein expression was made within the same patient: a more epileptic region was compared to a less epileptic brain region. The amount of epileptic activity was defined for each patient as the frequency of their interictal spikes (electric activity between seizures that is a parameter strongly linked to epilepsy). Proteins were resolved from three subcellular fractions, using a 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), revealing 31 identified protein spots that changed significantly. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was found to be consistently down regulated in high spiking brain tissue and showed a strong negative correlation with spike frequency. We also developed a two-step analysis method to select for protein species that changed frequently among the patients and identified these proteins. A total of 397 protein spots of interest (SOI) were clustered by protein expression patterns across all samples. These clusters were used as markers and this analysis predicted proteomic changes due to both histological differences and molecular pathways, revealed by examination of gene ontology clusters. Our experimental design and proteomic data analysis predicts novel glial changes, increased angiogenesis, and changes in cytoskeleton and neuronal projections between high and low interictal spiking regions. Quantitative histological staining of these same tissues for both the vascular and glial changes confirmed these findings, which provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Gal Keren-Aviram</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9ba:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>6cf59a96</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gal Keren-Aviram, Fabien Dachet, Shruti Bagla, Karina Balan, Jeffrey A.

There is a marked comorbidity between alcohol abuse and eating disorders, especially in the young population. We have previously reported that bingeing on fat during adolescence increases the rewarding effects of ethanol (EtOH). The aim of the present work was to study if vulnerability to EtOH persists after cessation of binge eating. OF1 mice binged on fat (HFB: high-fat binge) during adolescence (PND 25–43) and were tested for 15 days after the last access to HFB (on PND 59) using the self-administration paradigm, the conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization to ethanol. Our results showed that after 15 days of cessation of fat ingestion, mice increased their consumption of ethanol and showed greater motivation to obtain ethanol. On the other hand, no effects were observed in the CPP, while an increased locomotor response to ethanol was detected. The present results confirm and extend our previous study demonstrating that the compulsive intake of fat induces long-lasting effects on the reward system that lead to an increased consumption of EtOH.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>M.

Here we present a new model named Competitive Splice Site Model (COSSMO), which explicitly models these competitive effects and predict the PSI distribution over any number of putative splice sites. We model an alternative splicing event as the choice of a 3&apos; acceptor site conditional on a fixed upstream 5&apos; donor site, or the choice of a 5&apos; donor site conditional on a fixed 3&apos; acceptor site. We build four different architectures that use convolutional layers, communication layers, LSTMS, and residual networks, respectively, to learn relevant motifs from sequence alone. We also construct a new dataset from genome annotations and RNA-Seq read data that we use to train our model. Results: COSSMO is able to predict the most frequently used splice site with an accuracy of 70% on unseen test data, and achieve an R2 of 60% in modeling the PSI distribution.

Here we present a new model named Competitive Splice Site Model (COSSMO), which explicitly models these competitive effects and predict the PSI distribution over any number of putative splice sites. We model an alternative splicing event as the choice of a 3&apos; acceptor site conditional on a fixed upstream 5&apos; donor site, or the choice of a 5&apos; donor site conditional on a fixed 3&apos; acceptor site. We build four different architectures that use convolutional layers, communication layers, LSTMS, and residual networks, respectively, to learn relevant motifs from sequence alone. We also construct a new dataset from genome annotations and RNA-Seq read data that we use to train our model. Results: COSSMO is able to predict the most frequently used splice site with an accuracy of 70% on unseen test data, and achieve an R2 of 60% in modeling the PSI distribution. We visualize the motifs that COSSMO learns from sequence and show that COSSMO recognizes the consensus splice site sequences as well as many known splicing factors with high specificity.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes progressive disability in 1 of every 5,000 boys due to the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Despite much advancement in knowledge about DMD disease presentation and progression—attributable in part to studies using mouse and canine models of the disease–current DMD treatments are not equally effective in all patients. There remains, therefore, a need for translational animal models in which novel treatment targets can be identified and evaluated. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of DMD. As with DMD, speed of disease progression in GRMD varies substantially. However, unlike DMD, all GRMD dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the GRMD dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 GRMD dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which GRMD stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with DMD and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of GRMD as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) in faster-progressing GRMD dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in GRMD and DMD. In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fd:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>816dcdf7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford, Candice Chu, Cynthia Balog-Alvarez, Xue Yu, James J.

Background &lt;p&gt;PPAR-gamma (γ) is highly expressed in macrophages and its activation affects their polarization. The effect of PPAR-γ activation on Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) has not yet been evaluated. We investigated the effect of PPAR-γ activation on KC-polarization and IRI.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy percent (70%) liver ischemia was induced for 60mins. PPAR-γ-agonist or vehicle was administrated before reperfusion. PPAR-γ-antagonist was used to block PPAR-γ activation. Liver injury, necrosis, and apoptosis were assessed post-reperfusion. Flow-cytometry determined KC-phenotypes (pro-inflammatory Nitric Oxide +, anti-inflammatory CD206+ and anti-inflammatory IL-10+).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liver injury assessed by serum AST was significantly decreased in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group at all time points post reperfusion (1hr: 3092±105 vs 4469±551; p = 0.042; 6hr: 7041±1160 vs 12193±1143; p = 0.015; 12hr: 5746±328 vs 8608±1259; p = 0.049). Furthermore, liver apoptosis measured by TUNEL-staining was significantly reduced in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group post reperfusion (1hr:2.46±0.49 vs 6.90±0.85%;p = 0.001; 6hr:26.40±2.93 vs 50.13±8.29%; p = 0.048). H&amp;amp;E staining demonstrated less necrosis in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (24hr:26.66±4.78 vs 45.62±4.57%; p = 0.032). The percentage of pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs was significantly lower at all post reperfusion time points in the PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (1hr:28.49±4.99 vs 53.54±9.15%; p = 0.040; 6hr:5.51±0.54 vs 31.12±9.58%; p = 0.009; 24hr:4.15±1.50 vs 17.10±4.77%; p = 0.043). In contrast, percentage of anti-inflammatory CD206+ KCs was significantly higher in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group prior to IRI (8.62±0.96 vs 4.88 ±0.50%; p = 0.04). Administration of PPAR-γ-antagonist reversed the beneficial effects on AST, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;PPAR-γ activation reduces IRI and decreases the pro-inflammatory NO+ Kupffer cells.

Agricultural crops play an important role in the global carbon and water cycle. Global climate change scenarios predict enhanced water scarcity and altered precipitation pattern in many parts of the world. Hence, a mechanistic understanding of water fluxes, productivity and water use efficiency of cultivated crops is of major importance, i.e. to adapt management practices. We compared water and carbon fluxes of paddy and rainfed rice by canopy scale gas exchange measurements, crop growth, daily evapotranspiration, transpiration and carbon flux modeling. Throughout a monsoon rice growing season, soil evaporation in paddy rice contributed strongly to evapotranspiration (96.6% to 43.3% from initial growth to fully developed canopy and amounted to 57.9% of total water losses over the growing seasons. Evaporation of rainfed rice was significantly lower (by 65% on average) particularly before canopy closure. Water use efficiency (WUE) was significantly higher in rainfed rice both from an agronomic (WUE&lt;sub&gt;agro&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. grain yield per evapotranspiration) and ecosystem (WUE&lt;sub&gt;eco&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. gross primary production per evapotranspiration) perspective. However, our results also show that higher WUE in rainfed rice comes at the expense of higher respiration losses compared to paddy rice (26% higher on average). Hence, suggestions on water management depend on the regional water availability (i.e. Mediterranean vs. Monsoon climate) and the balance between higher respiratory losses versus a potential reduction in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that a shift from rainfed/unsaturated soil to waterlogged paddy conditions after closure of the rice canopy might be a good compromise towards a sustainable use of water while preserving grain yield, particularly for water-limited production areas.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Bhone Nay‐Htoon</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd070:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>5630449</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bhone Nay‐Htoon, Wei Xue, Steve Lindner, Matthias Cuntz, Jonghan Ko, John Tenhunen, Christiane Werner, Maren Dubbert&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Multiple drug resistant (MDR) intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are associated with notable direct and societal costs. As previous studies have not considered the impact of MDR on the total medical costs (TMCs) of IAIs, the present one examines this, as well as further estimates the additional costs at a national level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective study. Firstly, we randomly selected a sample of 40% of all inpatients discharged between 2014 and 2015 from a teaching hospital, due to limits in budget and the large number of patients. Then, we manually selected 254 patients with IAIs according to the International Classification of Disease, 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; revision, using electronic medical records. Eventually, 101 patients with IAIs (64 MDR patients and 37 non-MDR patients) were included after excluding cases without laboratory test results, any pathogens detected, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Univariate analysis and a generalized linear model were applied to assess the parameters associated with TMCs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to non-MDR patients, those with MDR pathogens were significantly associated with higher TMCs, higher antimicrobial costs, higher antimicrobial usage, larger number of pathogens, and longer length of stay and were more likely to have insurance and combination antimicrobial therapy. In addition, the average TMC among patients with MDR pathogens was ¥ 131801, which is ¥ 90201 higher than those without MDR pathogens. If our results are applied to the whole country, the sum of all attributable TMCs was ¥ 37 billion. The societal costs, furthermore, were ¥111 billion in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results provide information that should lead to increased efforts to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, in order to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens and to reduce their economic burden.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Xuemei Zhen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193977</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad280b:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>35d306d4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuemei Zhen, Yuanyuan Li, Yixi Chen, Peng Dong, Stephanie Liu, Hengjin Dong&lt;/p&gt;

In keeping with China’s President Xi Jinping’s “Chinese Dream,” China has set a goal of becoming a world-class innovator by 2050. China’s higher education Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) research environment will play a pivotal role in influencing whether China is successful in transitioning from a manufacturing-based economy to an innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy. Past studies on China’s research environment have been primarily qualitative in nature or based on anecdotal evidence. In this study, we surveyed STEM faculty from China’s top 25 universities to get a clearer understanding of how faculty members view China’s overall research environment. We received 731 completed survey responses, 17% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from abroad and 83% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from domestic institutions of higher education. We present results on why returnees decided to study abroad, returnees’ decisions to return to China, and differences in perceptions between returnees and domestic degree holders on the advantages of having a foreign degree. The top five challenges to China’s research environment identified by survey respondents were: a promotion of short-term thinking and instant success (37% of all respondents); research funding (33%); too much bureaucratic or governmental intervention (31%); the evaluation system (27%); and a reliance on human relations (26%). Results indicated that while China has clearly made strides in its higher education system, there are numerous challenges that must be overcome before China can hope to effectively produce the kinds of innovative thinkers that are required if it is to achieve its ambitious goals. We also raise questions about the current direction of education and inquiry in China, particularly indications that government policy is turning inward, away from openness that is central to innovative thinking.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Xueying Han</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195347</canonicalUrl><engagement>7</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>1423b345</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xueying Han, Richard P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Loss to care is high among asymptomatic HIV-infected women initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. However, whether pregnancy itself plays a role in the high loss to care rate is uncertain. We compared loss to care over seven years between pregnant and non-pregnant women at enrollment into HIV care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective analysis of all ART-naive women aged 15–45 initiating HIV care at two large clinics in Kinshasa, DRC, from 2007–2013. Pregnancy status was recorded at care enrollment. Patients were classified as having no follow-up if they did not return to care after the initial enrollment visit. Among those with at least one follow-up visit after enrollment, we classified patients as lost to care if more than 365 days had passed since their last clinic visit. We used logistic regression to model the association between pregnancy status and no follow-up, and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the association between pregnancy status and time to loss to care.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2175 women included in the analysis, 1497 (68.8%) were pregnant at enrollment. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were less likely to be over 35 years of age (19.1% vs. 31.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and less likely to be in WHO stage III or IV (9.0% vs. 26.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Among pregnant women, 106 (7.1%) were not seen after enrollment, versus 25 (3.7%) non-pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.24–3.24). Of the 2,044 women with at least one follow-up visit, 46.5% of pregnant women and 46.7% of non-pregnant women were lost to care by 5 years; hazards of loss to care were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant women (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.26).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large cohort of HIV-infected women, patients pregnant at care enrollment were more likely to never return for follow-up. Among those who attended at least one follow-up visit, loss to care was not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnancy itself may not be the main driver of the high attrition observed in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Jonathan Ross</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195231</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692f:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>e9c8c069</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Ross, Andrew Edmonds, Donald R.

During the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century the discussion on early human behavioral patterns revolved around the &lt;i&gt;hunting versus scavenging&lt;/i&gt; debate. The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks– 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores–were virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>José Yravedra</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194324</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2819:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>a2c9073e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by José Yravedra, Julia Aramendi, Miguel Ángel Maté-González, Lloyd Austin Courtenay, Diego González-Aguilera&lt;/p&gt;

Insulin is a vital part of diabetes treatment, whereas glucagon is primarily used to treat insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, glucagon is suggested to have a central role in the regulation of body weight, which would be beneficial for diabetic patients. Since the glucagon effect on blood glucose is known to be transient, it is relevant to investigate the pharmacodynamics of glucagon after repeated dosing. In the present study, we used telemetry to continuously measure blood glucose in streptozotocin induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. This allowed for a more detailed analysis of glucose regulation compared to intermittent blood sampling. In particular, we evaluated the blood glucose-lowering effect of different insulin doses alone, and in combination with a long acting glucagon analog (LAG). We showed how the effect of the LAG accumulated and persisted over time. Furthermore, we found that addition of the LAG decreased body weight without affecting food intake.
In a subsequent study, we focused on the glucagon effect on body weight and food intake during equal glycemic control. In order to obtain comparable maximum blood glucose lowering effect to insulin alone, the insulin dose had to be increased four times in combination with 1 nmol/kg of the LAG. In this set-up the LAG prevented further increase in body weight despite the four times higher insulin-dose. However, the body composition was changed. The insulin group increased both lean and fat mass, whereas the group receiving four times insulin in combination with the LAG only significantly increased the fat mass. No differences were observed in food intake, suggesting a direct effect on energy expenditure by glucagon. Surprisingly, we observed decreased levels of FGF21 in plasma compared to insulin treatment alone. With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Christina Pedersen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37a9:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>7444c4b7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christina Pedersen, Trine Porsgaard, Maria Thomsen, Mette Marie Rosenkilde, Nikolaj Kulahin Roed&lt;/p&gt;

In this set-up the LAG prevented further increase in body weight despite the four times higher insulin-dose. However, the body composition was changed. The insulin group increased both lean and fat mass, whereas the group receiving four times insulin in combination with the LAG only significantly increased the fat mass. No differences were observed in food intake, suggesting a direct effect on energy expenditure by glucagon. Surprisingly, we observed decreased levels of FGF21 in plasma compared to insulin treatment alone. With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</description><published>1521579600000</published><title>Sustained effect of glucagon on body weight and blood glucose: Assessed by continuous glucose monitoring in diabetic rats</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195085</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195085</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195085</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anup Srivastav, Tammy A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Influenza vaccination can prevent influenza and potentially serious influenza-related complications. Although the single best way to prevent influenza is annual vaccination, everyday preventive actions, including good hygiene, health, dietary, and social habits, might help, too. Several preventive measures are recommended, including: avoiding close contact with people who are sick; staying home when sick; covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing; washing your hands often; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; and practicing other good health habits like cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, getting plenty of sleep, and drinking plenty of fluids. Understanding public acceptance and current usage of these preventive behaviors can be useful for planning both seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention campaigns. This study estimated the percentage of adults in the United States who reported practicing preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza, and explored associations of reported behaviors with sociodemographic factors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 2015 National Internet Flu Survey, a nationally representative probability-based Internet panel survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population ≥18 years. The self-reported behaviors used to avoid catching or spreading influenza were grouped into four and three non-mutually exclusive subgroups, respectively. Weighted proportions were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted prevalence differences and to determine independent associations between sociodemographic characteristics and preventive behavior subgroups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Common preventive behaviors reported were: 83.2% wash hands often, 80.0% cover coughs and sneezes, 78.2% stay home if sick with a respiratory illness, 64.4% avoid people sick with a respiratory illness, 51.7% use hand sanitizers, 50.2% get treatment as soon as possible, and 49.8% report getting the influenza vaccination. Race/ethnicity, gender, age, education, income, region, receipt of influenza vaccination, and household size were associated with use of preventive behaviors after controlling for other factors.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many adults in the United States reported using preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza. Though vaccination is the most important tool available to prevent influenza, the addition of preventive behaviors might play an effective role in reducing or slowing transmission of influenza and complement prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Anup Srivastav</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195085</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c52:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>c50f433e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anup Srivastav, Tammy A.

Chronic constipation is a functional gastrointestinal disease that is detrimental to the quality of patient life. &lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; L. (CO) and &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; M. (FV) are commonly used as medicinal foods in many countries. We aimed to examine the laxative effect and their underlying mechanism of CO and FV mixture on loperamide (lop)-induced constipated rats. To determine the laxative effects of these compounds, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: the control, lop-induced constipated (2mg/kg), and three doses (100, 300, and 500mg/kg) of CO and FV mixture-, and Bisacodyl (bis, 3.3mg/kg)-treated groups. The mixture of CO and FV and bis were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. For induction of constipation, the lop were treated with a dose of 2 mg/kg twice a day on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week after treatments of CO and FV extracts and bis. The results were revealed that the CO and FV mixture has the laxative effects more than those in CO and FV-alone treatments on constipated rats by determining the stool parameters, including stool number and weight. Indeed, stool parameters, such as, stool number, weight, and water contents and colonic peristalsis from the intestinal transit length and ratio were dramatically improved by CO and FV mixture treatment. Histological study also revealed that CO and FV mixture enhanced the thicknesses of mucosa and muscular layers of the colon in constipated rats. For their underlying mechanism, the mRNAs and proteins expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) M2 and M3 and their downstream signaling were preserved by CO and FV mixture treatment in constipated rats. Therefore, this study suggests that treatment with CO and FV mixture has beneficial effects against constipation. We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Seung Hee Jang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195624</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d748:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>302f39ea</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Hee Jang, Dong Kwon Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Although various mathematical models of this oscillating system exist, it is not clear how to best model the required time delay.

Andexanet alfa, a novel modified recombinant human FXa, rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct and indirect FXa inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the ability of andexanet to reverse anticoagulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and reduce bleeding in rabbits administered edoxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies characterized the interaction of andexanet with edoxaban and its ability to reverse edoxaban-mediated anti-FXa activity. In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa. Andexanet rapidly and dose-dependently reversed the effects of edoxaban on FXa activity and coagulation pharmacodynamic parameters &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In edoxaban-anticoagulated rabbits, andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity by 82% (from 548±87 to 100±41 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), mean unbound edoxaban plasma concentration by ~80% (from 100±10 to 21±6 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), and blood loss by 80% vs. vehicle (adjusted for control, 2.6 vs. 12.9 g; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). The reduction in blood loss correlated with the decrease in anti-FXa activity (r = 0.6993, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and unbound edoxaban (r = 0.5951, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0035).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that andexanet rapidly reversed the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban, suggesting it could be clinically valuable for the management of acute and surgery-related bleeding. Correlation of blood loss with anti-FXa activity supports the use of anti-FXa activity as a biomarker for assessing anticoagulation reversal in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Genmin Lu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195122</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca425b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>aeea7a8c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Genmin Lu, Polly Pine, Janet M.

Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1PcJThDi81k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006065</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006065</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1628c98f9e7:4903f:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522777258471</crawled><fingerprint>7e9d9ffd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hironori Fujita, Masayoshi Kawaguchi&lt;/p&gt;

The Salmon louse (&lt;i&gt;Lepeophtheirus salmonis&lt;/i&gt;) is a marine ectoparasite of salmonid fish in the Northern Hemisphere and considered as a major challenge in aquaculture and a threat to wild populations of salmonids. Adult female lice produce a large number of lipid-rich eggs, however, the mechanism of maternal lipid transport into developing eggs during salmon louse reproduction has not been described. In the present study, a full-length &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt; lipophorin receptor (&lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt;) consisting of 16 exons was obtained by RACE and RT-PCR.

Phylogenetic analysis placed the LsLpR together with LpRs from decapods and insects. Expression analysis revealed that the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts was highest in the larvae and adult female lice.

Background &lt;p&gt;Linkage to and retention in care for US persons living with HIV (PLWH) after release from jail usually declines. We know of no rigorously evaluated behavioral interventions that can improve this. We hypothesized that a strengths-based case management intervention that we developed for PLWH leaving jail would increase linkage/retention in care (indicated by receipt of laboratory draws) and a suppressed HIV viral load (VL) in the year following release.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We conducted a quasi-experimental feasibility study of our intervention for PLWH jailed in Atlanta. We recruited 113 PLWH in jail starting in 2014. “SUCCESS” (Sustained, Unbroken Connection to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) began in jail and continued post-release. Subjects who started the intervention but subsequently began long-term incarcerations were excluded from further analysis. Persons who were retained in the intervention group were compared to contemporaneously incarcerated PLWH who did not receive the intervention. Identities were submitted to an enhanced HIV/AIDS reporting system (eHARS) at the state health department to capture all laboratories drawn.

Background &lt;p&gt;Linkage to and retention in care for US persons living with HIV (PLWH) after release from jail usually declines. We know of no rigorously evaluated behavioral interventions that can improve this. We hypothesized that a strengths-based case management intervention that we developed for PLWH leaving jail would increase linkage/retention in care (indicated by receipt of laboratory draws) and a suppressed HIV viral load (VL) in the year following release.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We conducted a quasi-experimental feasibility study of our intervention for PLWH jailed in Atlanta. We recruited 113 PLWH in jail starting in 2014. “SUCCESS” (Sustained, Unbroken Connection to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) began in jail and continued post-release. Subjects who started the intervention but subsequently began long-term incarcerations were excluded from further analysis. Persons who were retained in the intervention group were compared to contemporaneously incarcerated PLWH who did not receive the intervention. Identities were submitted to an enhanced HIV/AIDS reporting system (eHARS) at the state health department to capture all laboratories drawn. Both community engagement and care upon jail return were assessed equally. For 44 intervention participants released to Atlanta, 50% of care occurred on subsequent jail stays, as documented with EventFlow software. Forty-five receiving usual services only were recruited for comparison. By examining records of jail reentries, half of participants and 60% of controls recidivated (range: 1–8 returns). All but 6 participants in the intervention and 9 subjects in the comparison arm had ≥1 laboratory recorded in eHARS post-release. Among the intervention group, 52% were retained in care (i.e., had two laboratory studies, &gt; = 3 months apart), versus 40% among the comparison group (OR = 1.60, 95% CI (0.71, 3.81)). Both arms showed improved viral load suppression.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a trend towards increased retention for PLWH released from jail after SUCCESS, compared to usual services.

When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006070</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006070</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162688e2a3c:4d824:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522172570172</crawled><fingerprint>840f90f3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiva Farashahi, Chih-Chung Ting, Chang-Hao Kao, Shih-Wei Wu, Alireza Soltani&lt;/p&gt;

By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522182248935</recrawled><published>1522184400000</published><title>Dynamic combination of sensory and reward information under time pressure</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195108</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195108</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195108</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Abdulhakeem S.

It is generally believed that the unencapsulated sensory nerve terminals of modality specific C- and Aδ-neurons lack structural specialization. Here we determined the morphology of functionally defined polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors in the guinea pig corneal epithelium. Polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors were identified by extracellular recording at the surface of the corneal epithelium. After marking the recording sites, corneas were processed to reveal immunoreactivity for the transient receptor potential channels TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) or TPRM8 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8). Polymodal receptor nerve terminals (n = 6) were TRPV1-immunoreactive and derived from an axon that ascended from the sub-basal plexus to the squamous cell layer where it branched into fibers that ran parallel to the corneal surface and terminated with small bulbar endings (ramifying endings). Cold thermoreceptor nerve terminals were TRPM8-immunoreactive (n = 6) and originated from an axon that branched as it ascended through the wing cell and squamous cell layers and terminated with large bulbar endings (complex endings). These findings indicate that modality specific corneal sensory neurons with unencapsulated nerve endings have distinct nerve terminal morphologies that are likely to relate to their function.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Abdulhakeem S.

The accuracy of this process is largely dependent on the availability of machine-readable resources associating synonyms and abbreviations commonly found in biomedical literature with uniform identifiers. Results: In a task involving automated reading of ~215,000 articles using the REACH event extraction software we found that grounding was disproportionately inaccurate for multi-protein families (e.g., &amp;quot;AKT&amp;quot;) and complexes with multiple subunits (e.g. &amp;quot;NF-kappaB&amp;quot;).

In FamPlex the gene-level constituents of families and complexes are defined in a flexible format allowing for multi-level, hierarchical membership. To create FamPlex, text strings corresponding to entities were identified empirically from literature and linked manually to uniform identifiers; these identifiers were also mapped to equivalent entries in multiple related databases. FamPlex also includes curated prefix and suffix patterns that improve named entity recognition and event extraction. Evaluation of REACH extractions on a test corpus of ~54,000 articles showed that FamPlex significantly increased grounding accuracy for families and complexes (from 15% to 71%).

In Europe, responsible research and innovation (RRI) has emerged as a science policy measure that demands the early integration of a broad range of social actors and perspectives into research and development (R&amp;amp;D). More collaboration of the social sciences and humanities (SSH) with science and engineering appears within this policy framework as a crucial element that will enable better technological development. However, RRI is new to both natural scientists and SSH scholars, and interdisciplinary collaborations are challenging for many reasons. In this paper, we discuss these challenges while suggesting that what RRI can be in a particular project is not a given but remains an empirical question.

Studies conducted during the past few years have confirmed active West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in Serbia. Based on these studies and the epidemiological situation, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched national WNV surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015. The programmes encompassed the territory of Serbia and were conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the programmes was early detection of WNV and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase both clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The WNV surveillance programmes were based on direct and indirect surveillance of the presence of WNV by the serological testing of initially seronegative sentinel horses and chickens as well as through viral detection in pooled mosquito and wild bird samples. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in all seven districts of Vojvodina Province (northern Serbia) and Belgrade City, where most of the positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The West Nile virus surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015 showed satisfactory results in their capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and their sensitivity to early detect viral circulation at the enzootic level. Most of the human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation as part of the surveillance programmes. According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Tamaš Petrović</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195439</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd079:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>f4d07f1d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tamaš Petrović, Milanko Šekler, Dušan Petrić, Sava Lazić, Zoran Debeljak, Dejan Vidanović, Aleksandra Ignjatović Ćupina, Gospava Lazić, Diana Lupulović, Mišo Kolarević, Budimir Plavšić&lt;/p&gt;

Body size governs predator-prey interactions, which in turn structure populations, communities, and food webs. Understanding predator-prey size relationships is valuable from a theoretical perspective, in basic research, and for management applications. However, predator-prey size data are limited and costly to acquire. We quantified predator-prey total length and mass relationships for several freshwater piscivorous taxa: crappie (&lt;i&gt;Pomoxis&lt;/i&gt; spp.), largemouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus salmoides&lt;/i&gt;), muskellunge (&lt;i&gt;Esox masquinongy&lt;/i&gt;), northern pike (&lt;i&gt;Esox lucius&lt;/i&gt;), rock bass (&lt;i&gt;Ambloplites rupestris&lt;/i&gt;), smallmouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus dolomieu&lt;/i&gt;), and walleye (&lt;i&gt;Sander vitreus&lt;/i&gt;). The range of prey total lengths increased with predator total length. The median and maximum ingested prey total length varied with predator taxon and length, but generally ranged from 10–20% and 32–46% of predator total length, respectively. Predators tended to consume larger fusiform prey than laterally compressed prey. With the exception of large muskellunge, predators most commonly consumed prey between 16 and 73 mm. A sensitivity analysis indicated estimates can be very accurate at sample sizes greater than 1,000 diet items and fairly accurate at sample sizes greater than 100. However, sample sizes less than 50 should be evaluated with caution. Furthermore, median log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; predator-prey body mass ratios ranged from 1.9–2.5, nearly 50% lower than values previously reported for freshwater fishes.

Body size governs predator-prey interactions, which in turn structure populations, communities, and food webs. Understanding predator-prey size relationships is valuable from a theoretical perspective, in basic research, and for management applications. However, predator-prey size data are limited and costly to acquire. We quantified predator-prey total length and mass relationships for several freshwater piscivorous taxa: crappie (&lt;i&gt;Pomoxis&lt;/i&gt; spp.), largemouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus salmoides&lt;/i&gt;), muskellunge (&lt;i&gt;Esox masquinongy&lt;/i&gt;), northern pike (&lt;i&gt;Esox lucius&lt;/i&gt;), rock bass (&lt;i&gt;Ambloplites rupestris&lt;/i&gt;), smallmouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus dolomieu&lt;/i&gt;), and walleye (&lt;i&gt;Sander vitreus&lt;/i&gt;). The range of prey total lengths increased with predator total length. The median and maximum ingested prey total length varied with predator taxon and length, but generally ranged from 10–20% and 32–46% of predator total length, respectively. Predators tended to consume larger fusiform prey than laterally compressed prey. With the exception of large muskellunge, predators most commonly consumed prey between 16 and 73 mm. A sensitivity analysis indicated estimates can be very accurate at sample sizes greater than 1,000 diet items and fairly accurate at sample sizes greater than 100. However, sample sizes less than 50 should be evaluated with caution. Furthermore, median log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; predator-prey body mass ratios ranged from 1.9–2.5, nearly 50% lower than values previously reported for freshwater fishes. Managers, researchers, and modelers could use our findings as a tool for numerous predator-prey evaluations from stocking size optimization to individual-based bioenergetics analyses identifying prey size structure. To this end, we have developed a web-based user interface to maximize the utility of our models that can be found at www.LakeEcologyLab.org/pred_prey.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Go big or … don&apos;t?

The accurate identification and quality evaluation of herbal medical plants is highly necessary to ensure their safety and efficacy. In present study, a new strategy combining DNA barcoding techniques with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was proposed to facilitate the identification and quality control of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt;. In present work, the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) barcode was successfully used to identify 58 &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt; samples and its adulterants. TLC successfully identified the other three &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt; samples that failed to produce ITS2 regions. An adulterant was found in all the 62 samples. Moreover, the content of active medicinal ingredients is important for herbal plants quality. The content of tenacissoside H (TS-H) of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt; samples was determined by HPLC to range from 0.39% to 1.09%, which meets the criterion of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.

Background &lt;p&gt;Adult leg length is influenced by nutrition in the first few years of life. Adult head circumference is an indicator of brain growth. Cross-sectional studies indicate inverse associations with dementia risk, but there have been few prospective studies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, and anthropometric measures taken, with ascertainment of incident dementia, and mortality, three to five years later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the original at risk cohort of 13,587 persons aged 65 years and over, 2,443 (18.0%) were lost to follow-up; 10,540 persons with skull circumference assessments were followed up for 40,466 person years, and 10,400 with leg length assessments were followed up for 39,954 person years. There were 1,009 cases of incident dementia, and 1,605 dementia free deaths. The fixed effect pooled meta-analysed adjusted subhazard ratio (ASHR) for leg length (highest vs. lowest quarter) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.66–0.97) and for skull circumference was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.84–1.25), with no heterogeneity of effect between sites (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Leg length measurements tended to be shorter at follow-up, particularly for those with baseline cognitive impairment and dementia. However, leg length change was not associated with dementia incidence (ASHR, per cm 1.006, 95% CI 0.992–1.020), and the effect of leg length was little altered after adjusting for baseline frailty (ASHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–0.99). A priori hypotheses regarding effect modification by gender or educational level were not supported. However, the effect of skull circumference was modified by gender (M vs F ASHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.98), but in the opposite direction to that hypothesized with a greater protective effect of larger skull dimensions in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Consistent findings across settings provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life. Leg length is a relatively stable marker of early life nutritional programming, which may confer brain reserve and protect against neurodegeneration in later life through mitigation of cardiometabolic risk. Further clarification of these associations could inform predictive models for future dementia incidence in the context of secular trends in adult height, and invigorate global efforts to improve childhood nutrition, growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Martin J.

The relationship between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of neural systems is of central importance in brain network science. It is an open question, however, how the SC-FC relationship depends on specific topological features of brain networks or the models used for describing neural dynamics. Using a basic but general model of discrete excitable units that follow a susceptible—excited—refractory activity cycle (SER model), we here analyze how the network activity patterns underlying functional connectivity are shaped by the characteristic topological features of the network. We develop an analytical framework for describing the contribution of essential topological elements, such as common inputs and pacemakers, to the coactivation of nodes, and demonstrate the validity of the approach by comparison of the analytical predictions with numerical simulations of various exemplar networks. The present analytic framework may serve as an initial step for the mechanistic understanding of the contributions of brain network topology to brain dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-BJLyjXZ7qg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006084</href></item></canonical><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006084</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162ab8d3c72:d9a77:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523296582770</crawled><fingerprint>fd8895a0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagementRate>0.17</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arnaud Messé, Marc-Thorsten Hütt, Claus C.

These results indicate that mosquitoes can be genetically modified for resistance to malaria parasite infection and remain compatible with other vector-control measures without becoming better vectors for other pathogens.</description><published>1523394000000</published><title>Genetic modification of &amp;lt;i&gt;Anopheles stephensi&amp;lt;/i&gt; for resistance to multiple &amp;lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&amp;lt;/i&gt; strains does not influence susceptibility to o’nyong’nyong virus or insecticides, or Wolbachia-mediated resistance to the malaria parasite</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194503</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194503</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194503</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng-Han Wu, Bang-Hung Yang, Yuan-Hwa Chou, Shyh-Jen Wang, Jyh-Cheng Chen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-TRODAT-1 is a type of drug that can bind to dopamine transporters in living organisms and is often used in SPCT imaging for observation of changes in the activity uptake of dopamine in the striatum. Therefore, it is currently widely used in studies on clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and movement-related disorders. In conventional &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT image evaluation, visual inspection or manual selection of ROI for semiquantitative analysis is mainly used to observe and evaluate the degree of striatal defects. However, these methods are dependent on the subjective opinions of observers, which lead to human errors, have shortcomings such as long duration, increased effort, and have low reproducibility. To solve this problem, this study aimed to establish an automatic semiquantitative analytical method for &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-TRODAT-1. This method combines three drug templates (one built-in SPECT template in SPM software and two self-generated MRI-based and HMPAO-based TRODAT-1 templates) for the semiquantitative analysis of the striatal phantom and clinical images. At the same time, the results of automatic analysis of the three templates were compared with results from a conventional manual analysis for examining the feasibility of automatic analysis and the effects of drug templates on automatic semiquantitative analysis results.

We describe a computational model of social norms based on identifying values that a certain culture finds desirable such as dignity, generosity and politeness. The model quantifies these values in the form of Culture-Sanctioned Social Metrics (CSSMs) and treats social norms as the requirement to maximize these metrics from the perspective of the self, peers and public. This model can be used to create realistic social simulations, to explain or predict human behavior in specific scenarios, or as a component of robots or agents that need to interact with humans in specific social-cultural settings. We validate the model by using it to represent a complex deception scenario and showing that it can yield non-trivial insights such as the explanation of apparently irrational human behavior.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Ladislau Bölöni</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195331</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd89:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>d9e80a78</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ladislau Bölöni, Taranjeet Singh Bhatia, Saad Ahmad Khan, Jonathan Streater, Stephen M.

to fuels is required to enable the production of sustainable fuels and to
contribute to alleviating CO2 emissions. In considering conversion
of CO2, the initial step of adsorption and activation by the catalyst
is crucial. In addressing this difficult problem, we have examined how
nanoclusters of reducible metal oxides supported on TiO2 can promote
CO2 activation. In this paper we present density functional theory
(DFT) simulations of CO2 activation on heterostructures composed of extended
rutile and anatase TiO2 surfaces modified with chromia nanoclusters.
The heterostructures show non-bulk Cr and O sites in the nanoclusters and an
upshifted valence band edge that is dominated by Cr 3d- O 2p interactions. We
show that the supported chromia nanoclusters can adsorb and activate CO2 and
that activation of CO2 is promoted whether the TiO2
support is oxidised or hydroxylated. Reduced heterostructures, formed by
removal of oxygen from the chromia nanocluster, also promote CO2
activation. In the strong CO2 adsorption modes, the molecule bends
giving O-C-O angles of 127 - 132o and elongation of C-O distances up
to 1.30 Å; no carbonates are formed. The electronic properties show a strong CO2-Cr-O
interaction that drives the interaction of CO2 with the nanocluster
and induces the structural distortions. These results highlight that a metal
oxide support modified with reducible metal oxide nanoclusters can activate CO2,
thus helping to overcome difficulties associated with the difficult first step
in CO2 conversion.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Converting CO2

Both stem cell therapy and physical treatments have been shown to be beneficial in accelerating bone healing. However, the efficacy of combined treatment with stem cells and physical stimuli for large bone defects remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone regeneration effects of low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) and human adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) treatments during fracture repair using a comparative rat calvarial defect model. We evaluated the viability of human ADSCs, which were cultured on a porous PLGA scaffold using an MTS assay. The critical-sized calvarial bone defect rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPLI group, ADSC group, and ADSC+LPLI group. Bone formation was evaluated using micro-CT. New bone formation areas and osteogenic factor expression levels were then examined by histomorphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Our data showed that PLGA had no cytotoxic effect on human ADSCs. Micro-CT analyses revealed that both the LPLI and ADSC groups showed improved calvarial bone defect healing compared to the control group. In addition, the ADSC+LPLI group showed significantly increased bone volume at 16 weeks after surgery. The area of new bone formation ranked as follows: control group &amp;lt; LPLI group &amp;lt; ADSC group &amp;lt; ADSC+LPLI group. There were significant differences between the groups. In addition, both ADSC and ADSC+LPLI groups showed strong signals of vWF expression. ADSC and LPLI treatments improved fracture repair in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats. Importantly, the combined treatment of ADSCs and LPLI further enhances the bone healing process.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Yan-Hsiung Wang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195337</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4613:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>3df21530</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yan-Hsiung Wang, Jyun-Yi Wu, Su Chii Kong, Min-Hsuan Chiang, Mei-Ling Ho, Ming-Long Yeh, Chia-Hsin Chen&lt;/p&gt;

No effective medication-mediated intervention to accelerate rehabilitation has been established. We found that a small compound, edonerpic maleate, facilitated experience-driven synaptic glutamate AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic-acid) receptor delivery and resulted in the acceleration of motor function recovery after motor cortex cryoinjury in mice in a training-dependent manner through cortical reorganization.

Unrecognized endobronchial intubation frequently occurs after emergency intubation. However, no study has evaluated the effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We compared the hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during one-lung ventilation with those during conventional two-lung ventilation in a pig model of CPR, to determine the effect of the former on ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). However, no difference in ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was detected between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and oxygen saturation (SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) differed among the three types of ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, respectively).

However, the levels of these blood gases did not differ between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a live, viral vaccine under advanced development as a non-replicating smallpox vaccine. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted to demonstrate the humoral immunogenic equivalence of three consecutively manufactured MVA production lots, and to confirm the safety and tolerability of MVA focusing on cardiac readouts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The trial was conducted at 34 sites in the US. Vaccinia-naïve adults aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups using a 1:1:1:1 randomization scheme. Subjects received either two MVA injections from three consecutive lots (Groups 1-3), or two placebo injections (Group 4), four weeks apart. Everyone except personnel involved in vaccine handling and administration was blinded to treatment. Safety assessment focused on cardiac monitoring throughout the trial. Vaccinia-specific antibody titers were measured using a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The primary immunogenicity endpoint was Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after two MVA vaccinations measured by PRNT at trial visit 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01144637.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 2013 and May 2014, 4005 subjects were enrolled and received at least one injection of MVA (n = 3003) or placebo (n = 1002). The three MVA lots induced equivalent antibody titers two weeks after the second vaccination, with seroconversion rates of 99·8% (PRNT) and 99·7% (ELISA). Overall, 180 (6·0%) subjects receiving MVA and 29 (2·9%) subjects in the placebo group reported at least one unsolicited Adverse Event (AE) that was considered trial-related. Vaccination was well tolerated without significant safety concerns, particularly regarding cardiac assessment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The neutralizing and total antibody titers induced by each of the three lots were equivalent.

The overall survival (OS) of patients with ovarian cancer is poor while epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinico-pathologic characteristics, especially the prognostic factors, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Taiwan. Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p&amp;lt;0.001, p = 0.020, p&amp;lt;0.001, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC. Personalized medicine may be needed for different histological types of EOC because of their different outcomes.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Lin-Chau Chang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194993</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0aea:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><fingerprint>9df5e11f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin-Chau Chang, Chih-Fen Huang, Mei-Shu Lai, Li-Jiuan Shen, Fe-Lin Lin Wu, Wen-Fang Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Unstable conditions of the craniocervical junction such as atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) or atlanto-axial instability (AAI) are severe injuries with a high risk of tetraplegia or death. Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown.The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system.In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9° of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement. In case of unstable craniocervical junction, this leads to a dural sac compression and thus to possible damage to the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Shiyao Liao</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd06f:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>4ad99bdb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiyao Liao, Niko R.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Zhaoqing Du</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195336</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4612:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>fd6c6806</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Previously, we determined that nuclear translocation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK involves binding to heterodimers comprising importin 3 and either importin 7 or importin 9. Here, we identified the importin-binding region in p38 and JNK and developed a myristoylated peptide targeting this site that we called PERY. The PERY peptide specifically blocked the interaction of p38 and JNK with the importins, restricted their nuclear translocation, and inhibited phosphorylation of their nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) substrates. Through these effects, the PERY peptide reduced the proliferation of several (but not all) cancer cell lines in culture and inhibited the growth of a human breast cancer xenograft in mice. In addition, the PERY peptide substantially inhibited inflammation in mice, as manifested in models of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer.

Previously, we determined that nuclear translocation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK involves binding to heterodimers comprising importin 3 and either importin 7 or importin 9. Here, we identified the importin-binding region in p38 and JNK and developed a myristoylated peptide targeting this site that we called PERY. The PERY peptide specifically blocked the interaction of p38 and JNK with the importins, restricted their nuclear translocation, and inhibited phosphorylation of their nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) substrates. Through these effects, the PERY peptide reduced the proliferation of several (but not all) cancer cell lines in culture and inhibited the growth of a human breast cancer xenograft in mice. In addition, the PERY peptide substantially inhibited inflammation in mice, as manifested in models of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer. The PERY peptide more effectively prevented colon cancer development than did a commercial p38 inhibitor. In vivo analysis further suggested that this effect was mediated by PERY peptide–induced prevention of the nuclear translocation of p38 in macrophages.

Our understanding on the importance of viral lysis in the functioning of tropical estuarine ecosystem is limited. This study examines viral infection of prokaryotes and subsequent lysis of cells belonging to different morphotypes across a salinity gradient in monsoon driven estuarine ecosystem (Cochin estuary, India). High standing stock of viruses and prokaryotes accompanied by lytic infection rates in the euryhaline/mesohaline region of the estuary suggests salinity to have an influential role in driving interactions between prokaryotes and viruses. High prokaryotic mortality rates, up to 42% of prokaryote population in the pre-monsoon season is further substantiated by a high virus to prokaryote ratio (VPR), suggesting that maintenance of a high number of viruses is dependent on the most active fraction of bacterioplankton. Although myoviruses were the dominant viral morphotype (mean = 43%) throughout the study period, there was significant variation among prokaryotic morphotypes susceptible to viral infection. Among them, the viral infected short rod prokaryote morphotype with lower burst estimates (mean = 18 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was dominant (35%) in the dry seasons whereas a substantial increase in cocci forms (30%) infected by viruses with high burst size (mean = 31 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident during the monsoon season. Such preferential infections of prokaryotic morphopopulations with respect to seasons can have a strong and variable impact on the carbon and energy flow in this tropical ecosystem.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Vijayan Jasna</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194020</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d53:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>85a5d3b8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vijayan Jasna, Angia Sriram Pradeep Ram, Ammini Parvathi, Telesphore Sime-Ngando&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to explore the trend in population levels, as well as the correlates, of occupational and leisure sitting time in full-time employed Australian adults between 2007 and 2015. We used data from the 2007/08, 2011/12 and 2014/15 Australian Health Surveys, in which nationally representative samples of the Australian population were interviewed. Full-time (≥35 hours/week) employed respondents reported sitting time at work and during leisure on a usual workday. Trends over time and associations between socio-demographic and health-related characteristics and sitting time were analysed in the combined dataset using multivariable logistic regression models. Over 21,000 observations were included in the analyses. Across the three surveys, approximately 51% of the respondents reported ≥4 hours/workday occupational sitting time, 40% reported ≥4 hours/workday leisure sitting time, and 55% reported ≥7 hours/workday combined occupational and leisure sitting time. There were no clear trends over time. All potential correlates were associated with occupational sitting time and all but educational level were associated with leisure sitting time. The directions of the associations with gender, age and leisure-time physical activity were reversed for occupational sitting time and leisure sitting time. These findings show that the average levels of occupational and leisure sitting time on workdays were high but stable over the past decade. The observed differences in correlates of occupational and leisure sitting time demonstrate the need to assess and address sedentary behaviour domains separately in research and policy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Anne Loyen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195177</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc713e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>c248095f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne Loyen, Tien Chey, Lina Engelen, Adrian Bauman, Jeroen Lakerveld, Hidde P. van der Ploeg, Johannes Brug, Josephine Y.

Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight and the largest animals to ever take wing. The pterosaurs persisted for over 150 million years before disappearing at the end of the Cretaceous, but the patterns of and processes driving their extinction remain unclear. Only a single family, Azhdarchidae, is definitively known from the late Maastrichtian, suggesting a gradual decline in diversity in the Late Cretaceous, with the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction eliminating a few late-surviving species. However, this apparent pattern may simply reflect poor sampling of fossils. Here, we describe a diverse pterosaur assemblage from the late Maastrichtian of Morocco that includes not only Azhdarchidae but the youngest known Pteranodontidae and Nyctosauridae. With 3 families and at least 7 species present, the assemblage represents the most diverse known Late Cretaceous pterosaur assemblage and dramatically increases the diversity of Maastrichtian pterosaurs. At least 3 families—Pteranodontidae, Nyctosauridae, and Azhdarchidae—persisted into the late Maastrichtian. Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs show increased niche occupation relative to earlier, Santonian-Campanian faunas and successfully outcompeted birds at large sizes. These patterns suggest an abrupt mass extinction of pterosaurs at the K-Pg boundary.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ElO4GsSgvdo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001663</href></item></canonical><engagement>220</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2001663</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162208665b0:15c9c41:76251cdd</id><crawled>1520964101552</crawled><fingerprint>e9fb2329</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas R.

Understanding the regulation of insulin biosynthesis is important as it plays a central role in glucose metabolism. The mouse insulin gene2 (Ins2) has two splice variants; long (Ins2L) and short (Ins2S), that differ only in their 5’UTR sequence and Ins2S is the major transcript which translate more efficiently as compared to Ins2L. Here, we show that cellular factors bind preferentially to the Ins2L 5’UTR, and that PABP and HuD can bind to Ins2 splice variants and regulate its translation. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding assay with insulin 5’UTR and different HuD isoforms indicate that the ‘N’ terminal region of HuD is important for RNA binding and insulin translation repression. Using reporter assay we showed that specifically full-length HuD A isoform represses translation of reporter containing insulin 5’UTR. We further show that PABP and HuD interact with each other in RNA-dependent manner and this interaction is affected by glucose and PDI (5’UTR associated translation activator). These results suggest that PABP interacts with HuD in basal glucose conditions making translation inhibitory complex, however upon glucose stimulation this association is affected and PABP is acted upon by PDI resulting in stimulation of insulin translation. Together, our findings snapshot the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of insulin biosynthesis.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Poonam R.

In this paper we report the development of a cost-effective, modular, open source, and fully automated slide-scanning microscope, composed entirely of easily available off-the-shelf parts, and capable of bright field and fluorescence modes. The automated X-Y stage is composed of two low-cost micrometer stages coupled to stepper motors operated in open-loop mode. The microscope is composed of a low-cost CMOS sensor and low-cost board lenses placed in a 4f configuration. The system has approximately 1 micron resolution, limited by the f/# of available board lenses. The microscope is compact, measuring just 25×25×30 cm, and has an absolute positioning accuracy of ±1 μm in the X and Y directions. A Z-stage enables autofocusing and imaging over large fields of view even on non-planar samples, and custom software enables automatic determination of sample boundaries and image mosaicking. We demonstrate the utility of our device through imaging of fluorescent- and transmission-dye stained blood and fecal smears containing human and animal parasites, as well as several prepared tissue samples. These results demonstrate image quality comparable to high-end commercial microscopes at a cost of less than US$400 for a bright-field system, with an extra US$100 needed for the fluorescence module.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Qiang Lu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194063</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e01:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>80970825</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qiang Lu, Guanghui Liu, Chuanli Xiao, Chuanzhen Hu, Shiwu Zhang, Ronald X.

&lt;i&gt;Salvia verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; (wild sage) is a commonly cultivated herbal medicine plant, which is native to the Mediterranean climate regions of Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. However, it has become an invasive species in semi-arid and arid regions of southern Australia. Two varieties are present in this region, var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; and var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt;, each of which can be distinguished by differences in morphology and flowering period. Following trials to determine the optimum temperate regime for germination and response to light and dark, seeds of both varieties were tested for their response to variations in pH, moisture stress, salinity, and burial depth. The temperature and light trial was carried out using three different temperature regimes; 30/20°C, 25/15°C and 20/12°C, and two light regimes; 12 hours light/12 hours dark and 24 hours dark, with var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; responding to relatively higher temperatures than var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. The germination rate of neither species was significantly inhibited by complete darkness when compared to rates under periodic light exposure. Both varieties germinated at near optimum rates strongly to very strongly in all pH buffer solutions, from pH 5 to pH 10, but they responded most strongly at neutral pH. Var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; showed slightly more tolerance to reduced moisture availability, moderate to strong salinity, and burial depth, compared to var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. However, even a fairly shallow burial depth of 2 cm completely inhibited germination of both varieties. Thus, in circumstances where both varieties are present in a soil seedbank, var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; could be expected to establish in more challenging conditions, where moisture is limited and salinity is ‘moderate to high’, implying that it is a more serious threat for invasive weed in conditions where crop plants are already challenged.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Muhammad Mansoor Javaid</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194319</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:412391e:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>38320c7d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Mansoor Javaid, Singarayer Florentine, Hafiz Haider Ali, Sandra Weller&lt;/p&gt;

Autophagy plays a crucial role in health and disease, regulating central cellular processes such as adaptive stress responses, differentiation, tissue development, and homeostasis. However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti–hair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VVncDRle7Ww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002864</href></item></canonical><engagement>81</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002864</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1626db778eb:4248d4:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1522259163371</crawled><fingerprint>e04b4211</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Parodi, Jonathan A.

The ABCG2 multidrug transporter provides resistance against various endo- and xenobiotics, and protects the stem cells against toxins and stress conditions. We have shown earlier that a GFP-tagged version of ABCG2 is fully functional and may be used to follow the expression, localization and function of this transporter in living cells. In the present work we have overexpressed GFP-ABCG2, driven by a constitutive (CAG) promoter, in HUES9 human embryonic stem cells.

The ABCG2 multidrug transporter provides resistance against various endo- and xenobiotics, and protects the stem cells against toxins and stress conditions. We have shown earlier that a GFP-tagged version of ABCG2 is fully functional and may be used to follow the expression, localization and function of this transporter in living cells. In the present work we have overexpressed GFP-ABCG2, driven by a constitutive (CAG) promoter, in HUES9 human embryonic stem cells. Stem cell clones were generated to express the wild-type and a substrate-mutant (R482G) GFP-ABCG2 variant, by using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. We found that the stable overexpression of these transgenes did not change the pluripotency and growth properties of the stem cells, nor their differentiation capacity to hepatocytes or cardiomyocytes. ABCG2 overexpression provided increased toxin resistance in the stem cells, and protected the derived cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin toxicity. These studies document the potential of a stable ABCG2 expression for engineering toxin-resistant human pluripotent stem cells and selected stem cell derived tissues.</description><published>1523566800000</published><title>Generation of multidrug resistant human tissues by overexpression of the ABCG2 multidrug transporter in embryonic stem cells</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24107-6</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24107-6</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/-zhZuQljixs/s41598-018-24107-6</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of Family-1 UDP glycosyltransferase in three &lt;i&gt;Brassica&lt;/i&gt; species and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; indicates stress-responsive regulation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of Family-1 UDP glycosyltransferase in three &amp;lt;i&gt;Brassica&amp;lt;/i&gt; species and &amp;lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&amp;lt;/i&gt; indicates stress-responsive regulation, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24107-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24107-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of Family-1 UDP glycosyltransferase in three &lt;i&gt;Brassica&lt;/i&gt; species and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; indicates stress-responsive regulation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-zhZuQljixs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Hafiz Mamoon Rehman</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24107-6</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162bbf0bc1b:1118834:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523571538971</crawled><fingerprint>f7c2b6ee</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of Family-1 UDP glycosyltransferase in three &lt;i&gt;Brassica&lt;/i&gt; species and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; indicates stress-responsive regulation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of Family-1 UDP glycosyltransferase in three &amp;lt;i&gt;Brassica&amp;lt;/i&gt; species and &amp;lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&amp;lt;/i&gt; indicates stress-responsive regulation, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24107-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24107-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of Family-1 UDP glycosyltransferase in three &lt;i&gt;Brassica&lt;/i&gt; species and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; indicates stress-responsive regulation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-zhZuQljixs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1523602800000</published><title>Author Correction: Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of Family-1 UDP glycosyltransferase in three Brassica species and Arabidopsis indicates stress-responsive regulation</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195554</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195554</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195554</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susumu Yamaguchi, Nobutaka Horie, Minoru Morikawa, Yohei Tateishi, Takeshi Hiu, Yoichi Morofuji, Tsuyoshi Izumo, Kentaro Hayashi, Takayuki Matsuo&lt;/p&gt;
Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records—including SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—of consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI. SWAN- and DWI-based mASPECTSs were calculated, and correlations between DWI-SWAN mismatches with final infarct lesions or clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 35 patients included in this study, we confirmed cardioembolic stroke in 26, atherothrombotic stroke in 4, and unknown stroke etiology in 5. Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient&apos;s age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization.

The usefulness of a diagnostic workup for occult cancer in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) is controversial. We used the RIETE (Registro Informatizado Enfermedad Trombo Embólica) database to perform a nested case-control study to validate a prognostic score that identifies patients with unprovoked VTE at increased risk for cancer. We dichotomized patients as having low- (≤2 points) or high (≥3 points) risk for cancer, and tried to validate the score at 12 and 24 months. From January 2014 to October 2016, 11,695 VTE patients were recruited. Of these, 1,360 with unprovoked VTE (11.6%) were eligible for the study. At 12 months, 52 patients (3.8%; 95%CI: 2.9–5%) were diagnosed with cancer. Among 905 patients (67%) scoring ≤2 points, 22 (2.4%) had cancer. Among 455 scoring ≥3 points, 30 (6.6%) had cancer (hazard ratio 2.8; 95%CI 1.6–5; p&amp;lt;0.01). C-statistic was 0.63 (95%CI 0.55–0.71). At 24 months, 58 patients (4.3%; 95%CI: 3.3–5.5%) were diagnosed with cancer. Among 905 patients scoring ≤2 points, 26 (2.9%) had cancer. Among 455 patients scoring ≥3 points, 32 (7%) had cancer (hazard ratio 2.6; 95%CI 1.5–4.3; p&amp;lt;0.01). C-statistic was 0.61 (95%CI, 0.54–0.69).

Background &lt;p&gt;Agreed international development standards underpin high quality &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There is however, no international consensus on how high quality CPGs should ‘look’; or on whether high quality CPGs from one country can be viably implemented elsewhere. Writing d&lt;i&gt;e novo&lt;/i&gt; CPGs is generally resource-intensive and expensive, making this challenging in resource-poor environments. This paper proposes an alternative, efficient method of producing high quality CPGs in such circumstances, using existing CPGs layered by local knowledge, contexts and products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We undertook a mixed methods case study in South African (SA) primary healthcare (PHC), building on findings from four independent studies. These comprised an overview of international CPG activities; a rapid literature review on international CPG development practices; critical appraisal of 16 purposively-sampled SA PHC CPGs; and additional interrogation of these CPGs regarding how, why and for whom, they had been produced, and how they ‘looked’.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Despite a common aim to improve SA PHC healthcare practices, the included CPGs had different, unclear and inconsistent production processes, terminology and evidence presentation styles. None aligned with international quality standards. However many included innovative succinct guidance for end-users (which we classified as evidence-based summary recommendations, patient management tools or protocols). We developed a three-tiered model, a checklist and a glossary of common terms, for more efficient future production of better quality, contextually-relevant, locally-implementable SA PHC CPGs. Tier 1 involves transparent synthesis of existing high quality CPG recommendations; Tier 2 reflects local expertise to layer Tier 1 evidence with local contexts; and Tier 3 comprises tailored locally-relevant end-user guidance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our model could be relevant for any resource-poor environment. It should reduce effort and costs in finding and synthesising available research evidence, whilst efficiently focusing scant resources on contextually-relevant evidence-based guidance, and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Shingai Machingaidze</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195025</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c4e:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>4d5d5356</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shingai Machingaidze, Karen Grimmer, Quinette Louw, Tamara Kredo, Taryn Young, Jimmy Volmink&lt;/p&gt;

These comprised an overview of international CPG activities; a rapid literature review on international CPG development practices; critical appraisal of 16 purposively-sampled SA PHC CPGs; and additional interrogation of these CPGs regarding how, why and for whom, they had been produced, and how they ‘looked’.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Despite a common aim to improve SA PHC healthcare practices, the included CPGs had different, unclear and inconsistent production processes, terminology and evidence presentation styles. None aligned with international quality standards. However many included innovative succinct guidance for end-users (which we classified as evidence-based summary recommendations, patient management tools or protocols). We developed a three-tiered model, a checklist and a glossary of common terms, for more efficient future production of better quality, contextually-relevant, locally-implementable SA PHC CPGs. Tier 1 involves transparent synthesis of existing high quality CPG recommendations; Tier 2 reflects local expertise to layer Tier 1 evidence with local contexts; and Tier 3 comprises tailored locally-relevant end-user guidance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our model could be relevant for any resource-poor environment. It should reduce effort and costs in finding and synthesising available research evidence, whilst efficiently focusing scant resources on contextually-relevant evidence-based guidance, and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522443600000</published><title>Next generation clinical guidance for primary care in South Africa – credible, consistent and pragmatic</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194478</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194478</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194478</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sergi Trias-Llimós, Pekka Martikainen, Pia Mäkelä, Fanny Janssen&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of those questions that improves on further inspection – or deteriorates, according to your point of view, because it just keeps on getting more complicated. For decades, there was no good answer at all, but then there was “It reduces signaling in the inflammation pathways”, followed by “OK, it seems to do that by decreasing this prostaglandin signaling molecule” and “Ah, it does that by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, a key enzyme in the pathway to make those”. Then we moved to “Hold it, there’s more than one cyclooxygenase”, which is how we ended up with the COX-2 inhibitors like Vioxx, which led to “You know, the functions of these two are more complicated than we even thought”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on top of all these, there are clearly effects of NSAID drugs that have nothing to do with the COX enzymes at all. Blood clotting you can pretty much chalk up to the COX isoforms, but there are more things going on, and they’re very poorly defined. Which brings up a more general question: how do you ever know about all the things that a small-molecule drug might be doing in a living system? The answer is, you don’t. That’s not generally appreciated outside the biomedical professions, but it’s the truth. We don’t have some way to track things around and watch them interact at a molecule level through out a cell or an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. Mapping compound-protein interactions is a big part of chemical biology, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b11639&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Woo lab at Harvard shows an attempt to track small molecules in just this way. It uses photoaffinity labeling, via the now-nearly-standard combination tag of a diazirine and an acetylene, which lets you form a covalent bond to (most) of the thing the molecule of interest is spending time next to, and on the back end of the process, it uses isotope-labeled tags on the acetylene-click-conjugation step to give the mass spec detection a much higher signal/noise. Just digging through the whole cellular proteome without the kind of validation that isotope tagging gives you is a tall order, but the deliberately-weird-mass-combination effect of the stable isotope tags moves things up out of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three NSAIDs are given the treatment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen&quot;&gt;naproxen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib&quot;&gt;celecoxib&lt;/a&gt; (Celebrex), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin&quot;&gt;indomethacin&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a good spread of activity: naproxen hits both COX-1 and COX-2 pretty much equally, celecoxib is of course a COX-2 selective compound, and indomethacin is in a structurally distinct class that’s already known to have some other modes of action. &lt;em&gt;(Update:&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja408322b&quot;&gt; here’s work&lt;/a&gt; from another group on an alkyne-tagged aspirin derivative, which also interacts with a long list of cellular proteins).&lt;/em&gt; All the photolabel-derivatized compounds were still active against COX enzymes (albeit with somewhat lower affinity), and all of them could be displaced by the parent compounds in competition assays. All of them photo-labeled COX-2 in an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiment, as they certainly should, and this experiment was used to validate the mass spec analysis methods for the whole-cell experiments. (For example, each of these compounds produces six or seven different photoadducts, depending on which nearby amino acid gets snagged by the reactive carbene that forms from the diazirene, and the group was able to see and account for all of these without difficulty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens in cells? They tried the dosing/photolabeling experiment in Jurkat cells, along with experiments with photoactive negative control (non-NSAID) compounds. About 700 proteins were labeled in all, with quite a bit of overlap between the three NSAIDs (40% of them are hit by all three), and that figure alone should make a person stop and think a bit: &lt;em&gt;as simple and widely used a molecule as naproxen binds to hundreds of proteins well enough to photolabel them&lt;/em&gt;. No, we don’t know the details of what’s going on in there, do we? Admittedly, that’s at a high concentration (250 micromolar), but (1) patients take whopping doses of this stuff in the real world, and (2) the majority of these interactions also showed up at a 50 micromolar dose as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same set of experiments was also run in K562 cells, a leukemia line. In this case, there were 513 enriched protein targets and &lt;em&gt;only 206 of them overlapped&lt;/em&gt; with the set from the Jurkat cells. And that’s also something to think about – not only do small, well-known compounds like these interact with a long list of proteins, that list can change dramatically in different cell backgrounds. Only about 30% of the total list of proteins have ever been report to interact with any small molecules at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of these doesn’t show any particular compartmentalization effects in the cells; it pretty much tracks protein abundance across the cytoplasm, various organelles, nucleus and so on. A closer look at the proteins and their interaction sites can be found in the paper, but one thing worth mentioning is a “hot spot” in histone H2A, which is certainly not a target that anyone had been thinking about for NSAIDs, to my knowledge. Assigning all the specific sites of labeling across the proteome is still beyond current technology, although you can think of some experiments that would help narrow things down a lot (different protein digestion before the mass spec, and so on). But even at this level – which is more detailed than we’ve ever had for such compounds – there’s a lot to deal with here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you needed a reminder about just what a complicated mixing bowl we’re throwing our compounds into, here you go. The hope is that such techniques and the ungodly huge piles of data that they generate will help up build up a clearer picture of drug action. But what a picture that’s going to be!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>When you take an NSAID (naproxen, ibuprofen, aspirin, etc.), how does it work?

It makes sense – if you want things to react, getting all the partners dissolved in some medium where they can roam around and contact each other is surely the way to go, most of the time. But it’s also true that we don’t really have a good grasp of what’s happening in solution at the molecular level. Solvation shells, nanoscale aggregates and clusters, effects of interfacial regions: the idealized picture of things floating around is complicated by a lot of real-world effects, which can be very important. They’re particularly so when it comes to dissolution and its opposite, precipitation and crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the formation of microcrystals. I know that I had a mental picture of these that is probably incorrect. As I imagined it, all sorts of nucleation events happened in solution but the size of the resulting crystals was constrained (perhaps by amount of available solute, or by effects of stirring) so that they just didn’t grow very large. But in many systems, it appears that what happens first is a liquid-liquid phase separation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;sound familiar?&lt;/a&gt;), what’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition&quot;&gt;spinodal decomposition&lt;/a&gt; into microscopic solute-rich and solute-poor droplets, and the solute-rich ones then crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201711128&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; provides another example of liquid-phase weirdness. The authors are looking at a very well-known reaction, reduction of a metal salt to the elemental metal. That sentence hides a lot of complications: for example, what form does this metal arrive in? You can get a mirror deposit on the inside wall of the vessel (as with the famous old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent&quot;&gt;Tollens reagent&lt;/a&gt; or the other more stable mirror-silvering mixtures), but more often you get some sort of fine black powder. Microscopic examination of that, though, reveals a huge range of particle sizes and morphologies depending on conditions, and it’s just those changes that can make a big difference in (for example) catalyst performance. Finely divided high-surface-area metals (palladium/platinum on carbon, Raney nickel, Rieke metals) are very important in synthetic chemistry, and their properties vary tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work provides an ingenious variation. The authors take an aqueous solution of the metal salt (silver nitrate in the first example), freeze it in liquid nitrogen, and then let this ice chunk slowly dissolve in a cold solution of the reducing agent (sodium borohydride). That gives, under the right conditions, essentially an atom-by-atom release of silver ions into the solution, and what you get out is atomically dispersed metal. By electron microscopy, the great bulk of the material is produced as what are apparently single silver atoms, not clusters, aggregates, etc. (there’s also further characterization by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_X-ray_absorption_fine_structure&quot;&gt;EXAFS&lt;/a&gt;). I’m surprised that it doesn’t form those on standing, but as I said before, there are a lot of things about the solution phase that my mental models don’t handle well. The authors believe (on the basis of modeling calculations) that the solvation shell around the single metal atoms is a barrier to forming such nanoparticles, and that the release of individual metal atoms is thus key to the whole process. Dimers of silver atoms and the like seem to be just fine in aqueous solution if they can form (or if they’re whittled down to that size); this synthesis just doesn’t let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates the same sort of chemistry with a whole list of metals – platinum, palladium, cobalt, nickel, copper, iridium, gold and more. It certainly seems to be a general process, and the resulting atomically dispersed metals would, you’d have to imagine, be very active catalysts in further reactions. What’s more, this entire method would seem to have applications in many other reactions, too, where the slow release of one reactant into an excess of another is important. I’m actually kicking myself not to have thought of something like this – in hindsight it seems like a perfectly simple idea, but try coming up with these in the forward direction!&lt;/p&gt;

Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined.

Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.</description><published>1522184400000</published><title>Statistical and Machine Learning forecasting methods: Concerns and ways forward</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1355?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1355?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1355?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Cancer is characterized by an accumulation of genetic alterations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) are common in military populations. However, only a limited number of studies have followed soldiers during international deployments and investigated the prevalence of MSCI during and at the end of their deployment. The aim was to describe the prevalence of MSCI in different military occupational specialties and categorise their most common tasks in terms of exposures to physical workloads during a six-month long international deployment in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey, including 325 soldiers (300 men), aged 20–62 participating in an international deployment in Afghanistan during the spring of 2012. Soldiers were clustered into different military occupational specialties: Infantry, Administration, Logistics, Logistics/Camp, Medical and Other. Data were collected through the use of the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol at the end of the international mission.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven percent reported MSCI during deployment, with 28% at the end.The most common locations of MSCI during the mission were lower back, knee, shoulders, upper back, neck and foot, while the knee and lower back prevailed at the end of the mission. Almost half of the soldiers who had MSCI reported affected work ability. The most common duties during the mission were vehicle patrolling, staff duties, guard/security duties, foot patrols and transportation. Soldiers reported that vehicle patrolling, staff duties and transportation were demanding with respect to endurance strength, guard/security duties challenged both maximum and endurance strength while foot patrolling challenged maximum and endurance strength, aerobic and anaerobic endurance and speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MSCI during international deployment are common among Swedish soldiers. The results indicate the need to further develop strategies focusing on matching the soldiers’ capacity to the job requirements, with relevant and fair physical selection-tests during the recruitment process and proactive interventions targeting MSCI before and during deployment, in order to enhance soldiers’ readiness and promote operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Alexandra Halvarsson</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195548</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d73f:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>2ae4a2de</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandra Halvarsson, Ingela Hagman, Matthias Tegern, Lisbet Broman, Helena Larsson&lt;/p&gt;

Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well-validated target for the therapy of adult cancers. Propane-1,3-diphosphonic acid (PDPA) has significant inhibitory properties against human thymidylate synthase (hTS) relative to mouse TS which is not predicted to adopt an inactive conformer. The current research aims to identify novel, lead inhibitors of hTS and examine the prediction that they bind selectively to hTS enzymes existing in different conformational equilibria. Conformer-selectivity was evaluated through performing activity inhibition studies, as well as intrinsic fluorescence (IF) studies in comparison to the known orthosteric inhibitor raltitrexed (RTX). Human TS was isolated from recombinant bacteria expressing either native hTS, capable of conformational switching, or an actively stabilized mutant (R163K-hTS). The examined test compounds were rationally or virtually predicted to have inhibitory activity against hTS. Among these compounds, glutarate, N-(4-carboxyphenyl) succinamic acid, and diglycolic anhydride showed higher selectivity towards native hTS as compared to R163K-hTS.

Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well-validated target for the therapy of adult cancers. Propane-1,3-diphosphonic acid (PDPA) has significant inhibitory properties against human thymidylate synthase (hTS) relative to mouse TS which is not predicted to adopt an inactive conformer. The current research aims to identify novel, lead inhibitors of hTS and examine the prediction that they bind selectively to hTS enzymes existing in different conformational equilibria. Conformer-selectivity was evaluated through performing activity inhibition studies, as well as intrinsic fluorescence (IF) studies in comparison to the known orthosteric inhibitor raltitrexed (RTX). Human TS was isolated from recombinant bacteria expressing either native hTS, capable of conformational switching, or an actively stabilized mutant (R163K-hTS). The examined test compounds were rationally or virtually predicted to have inhibitory activity against hTS. Among these compounds, glutarate, N-(4-carboxyphenyl) succinamic acid, and diglycolic anhydride showed higher selectivity towards native hTS as compared to R163K-hTS. The active site inhibitor RTX showed significantly higher inhibition of R163K-hTS relative to hTS. Targeting hTS via conformational selectivity represents a future approach for overcoming reported resistance towards active-state TS analogs.</description><published>1521061200000</published><title>Biomolecular study of human thymidylate synthase conformer-selective inhibitors: New chemotherapeutic approach</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2556.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2556.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2556.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Bone deficits are frequent in HIV-1–infected patients.

Use of virtual reality (VR) technology is often accompanied by a series of unwanted symptoms, including nausea and headache, which are characterised as ‘simulator sickness’. Sensory mismatch has been thought to lie at the heart of the problem and recent studies have shown that reducing cue mismatch in VR can have a therapeutic effect. Specifically, electrical stimulation of vestibular afferent nerves (galvanic vestibular stimulation; GVS) can reduce simulator sickness in VR. However, GVS poses a risk to certain populations and can also result in negative symptoms in normal, healthy individuals. Here, we tested whether noisy vestibular stimulation through bone-vibration can also reduce symptoms of simulator sickness. We carried out two experiments in which participants performed a spatial navigation task in VR and completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire over a series of trials. Experiment 1 was conducted using a high-end projection-based VR display, whereas Experiment 2 involved the use of a consumer head mounted display. During each trial, vestibular stimulation was either: 1) absent; 2) coupled with large angular accelerations of the projection camera; or 3) applied randomly throughout each trial. In half of the trials, participants actively navigated using a motion controller, and in the other half they were moved passively through the environment along pre-recorded motion trajectories. In both experiments we obtained lower simulator sickness scores when vestibular stimulation was coupled with angular accelerations of the camera. This effect was obtained for both active and passive movement control conditions, which did not differ. The results suggest that noisy vestibular stimulation can reduce simulator sickness, and that this effect appears to generalize across VR conditions. We propose further examination of this stimulation technique.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Séamas Weech</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194137</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2812:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>b6d54c28</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Séamas Weech, Jae Moon, Nikolaus F.

Graphic warnings (GWs) on cigarette packs are widely used internationally with the aim of reducing smoking behavior. In the current study, we investigated whether GWs influence implicit evaluations of smoking, a potential moderator of smoking behavior, as measured with an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Results showed that viewing a GW did not produce more negative implicit evaluations of smoking for daily smokers, occasional smokers, or non-smokers, compared to viewing a text-only warning. If anything, effects were in the direction of evaluations of smoking being &lt;i&gt;more positive&lt;/i&gt; after certain participants (i.e., daily and occasional smokers) viewed a GW. We also did not find any beneficial effects of GWs on explicit evaluations of smoking. These results contrast with the observation that non-smokers and occasional smokers (but not daily smokers) believed that GWs would be more effective than the text-only warnings. We discuss implications and limitations of these findings and provide recommendations for improving the effectiveness of cigarette pack warnings on implicit evaluations.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Pieter Van Dessel</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194627</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a62e:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>15d944d9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pieter Van Dessel, Colin Tucker Smith, Jan De Houwer&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity to respiratory gating, field strength and ventricle segmentation of hemodynamic force quantification in the left and right ventricles of the heart (LV and RV) using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to provide free hemodynamic force analysis software.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A pulsatile flow phantom was imaged using 4D flow MRI and laser-based particle image velocimetry (PIV). Cardiac 4D flow MRI was performed in healthy volunteers at 1.5T (n = 23). Reproducibility was investigated using MR scanners from two different vendors on the same day (n = 8). Subsets of volunteers were also imaged without respiratory gating (n = 17), at 3T on the same day (n = 6), and 1–12 days later on the same scanner (n = 9, median 6 days).

The critically endangered Northern bald ibis (&lt;i&gt;Geronticus eremita&lt;/i&gt;) is a migratory bird that became extinct in Europe centuries ago. Since 2014, the Northern bald ibis is subject to an intensive rehabilitation and conservation regime aiming to reintroduce the bird in its original distribution range in Central Europe and concurrently to maintain bird health and increase population size. Hitherto, virtually nothing is known about the microbial communities associated with the ibis species; an information pivotal for the veterinary management of these birds. Hence, the present study was conducted to provide a baseline description of the cultivable microbiota residing in the Northern bald ibis. Samples derived from the choana, trachea, crop and cloaca were examined employing a culturomic approach in order to identify microbes at each sampling site and to compare their frequency among age classes, seasonal appearances and rearing types. In total, 94 microbial species including 14 potentially new bacterial taxa were cultivated from the Northern bald ibis with 36, 58 and 59 bacterial species isolated from the choana, crop and cloaca, respectively. The microbiota of the Northern bald ibis was dominated by members of the phylum &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, followed by &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fusobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, altogether phylotypes commonly observed within avian gut environments. Differences in relative abundances of various microbial taxa were evident among sample types indicating mucosa-specific colonisation properties and tissue tropism. Besides, results of the present study indicate that the composition of microbiota was also affected by age, season (environment) and rearing type. While the prevalence of traditional pathogenic microbial species was extremely low, several opportunists including &lt;i&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/i&gt; toxotype A were frequently present in samples indicating that the Northern bald ibis may represent an important animal reservoir for these pathogens. In summary, the presented study provides a first inventory of the cultivable microbiota residing in the critically endangered Northern bald ibis and represents a first step in a wider investigation of the ibis microbiome with the ultimate goal to contribute to the management and survival of this critically endangered bird.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Joachim Spergser</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195255</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f5:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>23aa4d19</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joachim Spergser, Igor Loncaric, Alexander Tichy, Johannes Fritz, Alexandra Scope&lt;/p&gt;

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drug performances depend on the viral genotype. So international recommendations give typing of the virus a prerequisite for treatment choice and patient management. Commercially available HCV genotyping kits are scarce and this analysis is often in-house using tedious PCRs and Sanger sequencing, leading to a lack of standardization. A newly commercialized HCV genotyping assay based on real-time PCR has been developed by Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). We compared this new assay with our in-house PCRs -sequencing technique on 101 regular samples and 81 LiPA failures or low viral load samples. No genotype or 1a/1b subtype mismatch was observed. Two samples were misidentified at the subtype level without clinical impact. Three genotype 1b and two genotype 1a samples with low viral load could not be subtyped. Nevertheless, 13 (13%) samples from the regular panel and 35 (43%) from the more difficult-to-type panels failed to give results on first pass with the Roche kit. Failures were mostly associated with genotype 3 subtype a, with genotype 4 subtype non-a, or with viral loads &amp;lt;200 IU/mL (p = 0.0061). The workflow allowed a non-specialized technician to obtain results in less than 4 hours whereas 2 to 3 days and experienced staff were required with the in-house assay. In conclusion, the Roche cobas&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; HCV GT kit is easy and rapid to use and provides reliable results.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (&lt;i&gt;Anas acuta&lt;/i&gt;), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>Influenza A virus recovery, diversity, and intercontinental exchange: A multi-year assessment of wild bird sampling at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3888.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3888.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3888.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Chemical communication is fundamental to success in social insect colonies.

Vandetanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of various cancers, has been reported to induce several adverse cardiac effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of vandetanib-induced cardiotoxicity are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of vandetanib-induced cardiotoxicity using intracellular electrophysiological recordings on human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), rabbit Purkinje fibers, and HEK293 cells transiently expressing human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG; the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt;), KCNQ1/KCNE1 (the slowly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt;), KCNJ2 (the inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt;) or SCN5A (the inward Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;). Purkinje fiber assays and ion channel studies showed that vandetanib at concentrations of 1 and 3 μM inhibited the hERG currents and prolonged the action potential duration. Alanine scanning and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; hERG docking studies demonstrated that Y652 and F656 in the hERG S6 domain play critical roles in vandetanib binding. In hiPSC-CMs, vandetanib markedly reduced the maximum rate of depolarization during the AP upstroke. Ion channel studies revealed that hiPSC-CMs were more sensitive to inhibition of the &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; by vandetanib than in a heterogeneously expressed HEK293 cell model, consistent with the changes in the AP parameters of hiPSC-CMs. The subclasses of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs inhibited &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; currents in a dose-dependent manner in hiPSC-CMs and SCN5A-encoded HEK293 cells. The inhibitory potency of vandetanib for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; was much higher in hiPSC-CMs (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 2.72 μM) than in HEK293 cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 36.63 μM).

Background &lt;p&gt;Few studies have investigated the difference in bacterial contamination between conventional reused ventilator systems and disposable closed ventilator-suction systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial contamination rates of the reused and disposable ventilator systems, and the association between system disconnection and bacterial contamination of ventilator systems.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The enrolled intubated and mechanically ventilated patients used a conventional reused ventilator system and a disposable closed ventilator-suction system, respectively, for a week; specimens were then collected from the ventilator circuit systems to evaluate human and environmental bacterial contamination. The sputum specimens from patients were also analyzed in this study.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The detection rate of bacteria in the conventional reused ventilator system was substantially higher than that in the disposable ventilator system. The inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the disposable closed ventilator-suction system had higher bacterial concentrations than the conventional reused ventilator system. The bacterial concentration in the heated humidifier of the reused ventilator system was significantly higher than that in the disposable ventilator system. Positive associations existed among the bacterial concentrations at different locations in the reused and disposable ventilator systems, respectively.

The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) consist of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and chemical additives for flavoring. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, and while some have been tested for toxicity in the laboratory, most have not. Here, we developed a 3-phase, 384-well, plate-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to rapidly triage and validate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids. Our data demonstrated that the PG/VG vehicle adversely affected cell viability and that a large number of e-liquids were more toxic than PG/VG. We also performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on all tested e-liquids. Subsequent nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that e-liquids are an extremely heterogeneous group. Furthermore, these data indicated that (i) the more chemicals contained in an e-liquid, the more toxic it was likely to be and (ii) the presence of vanillin was associated with higher toxicity values. Further analysis of common constituents by electron ionization revealed that the concentration of cinnamaldehyde and vanillin, but not triacetin, correlated with toxicity. We have also developed a publicly available searchable website (www.eliquidinfo.org).

The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) consist of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and chemical additives for flavoring. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, and while some have been tested for toxicity in the laboratory, most have not. Here, we developed a 3-phase, 384-well, plate-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to rapidly triage and validate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids. Our data demonstrated that the PG/VG vehicle adversely affected cell viability and that a large number of e-liquids were more toxic than PG/VG. We also performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on all tested e-liquids. Subsequent nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that e-liquids are an extremely heterogeneous group. Furthermore, these data indicated that (i) the more chemicals contained in an e-liquid, the more toxic it was likely to be and (ii) the presence of vanillin was associated with higher toxicity values. Further analysis of common constituents by electron ionization revealed that the concentration of cinnamaldehyde and vanillin, but not triacetin, correlated with toxicity. We have also developed a publicly available searchable website (www.eliquidinfo.org). Given the large numbers of available e-liquids, this website will serve as a resource to facilitate dissemination of this information. Our data suggest that an HTS approach to evaluate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids is feasible. Such an approach may serve as a roadmap to enable bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better regulate e-liquid composition.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Djo1Z76O3OU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522172523352</recrawled><published>1522184400000</published><title>Evaluation of e-liquid toxicity using an open-source high-throughput screening assay</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00077</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>355</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00077/20180316/images/medium/oc-2018-00077e_0002.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00077</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00077</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521172800000</published><author><name>José Pedro Friedmann Angeli, Marcus Conrad</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_16230ef76a2:6b4e7:a077e55f</id><crawled>1521239422626</crawled><fingerprint>859e80aa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00077/20180316/images/medium/oc-2018-00077e_0002.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00077&lt;/div&gt;</description><recrawled>1521570583293</recrawled><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00077/20180316/images/medium/oc-2018-00077e_0002.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00077&lt;/div&gt;</content></summary><title>[ASAP] Lipoxygenases—Killers against Their Will?</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295527v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295527v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295527v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Multivariate regression modelling provides a statistically powerful means of quantifying the effects of a given treatment while compensating for sources of variation and noise, such as variability between human donors and the behaviour of different peptides during mass spectrometry.

The centrosome is a non–membrane-bound cellular compartment consisting of 2 centrioles surrounded by a protein coat termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles generally remain physically associated together (a phenomenon called centrosome cohesion), yet how this occurs in the absence of a bounding lipid membrane is unclear. One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties, or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles), in contrast, do not form roots and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing discrete roots. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent reshuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003998</href></item></canonical><engagement>4</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003998</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2af:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523555694285</crawled><fingerprint>6886410e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagementRate>0.4</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Mahen&lt;/p&gt;

One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties, or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles), in contrast, do not form roots and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing discrete roots. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent reshuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1523555760964</recrawled><published>1523566800000</published><title>Stable centrosomal roots disentangle to allow interphase centriole independence</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04009-3</originId><published>1522393200000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04009-3</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04009-3</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A squid-skin-inspired invisibility cloak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A squid-skin-inspired invisibility cloak, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04009-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04009-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Patterning allows stretchy polymer to hide from heat sensors.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>29</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16277684e6f:795877b:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522421747311</crawled><fingerprint>6a166114</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A squid-skin-inspired invisibility cloak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A squid-skin-inspired invisibility cloak, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04009-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04009-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Patterning allows stretchy polymer to hide from heat sensors.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04009-3/d41586-018-04009-3_15574036.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>A squid-skin-inspired invisibility cloak</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0099-z</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0099-z</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0099-z</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A brainstem bypass for spinal cord injury&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brainstem bypass for spinal cord injury, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0099-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0099-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Spinal cord injury disrupts connectivity between the brain and the body.

We analyse the behaviour of a non-linear model of coupled stock and bond prices exhibiting periodically collapsing bubbles.

A dynamical phase space representation of that system coupled with standard multiplicative noise rationalises the log-periodic power law singularity pattern documented in many historical financial bubbles. The notion of ‘ghosts of finite-time singularities’ is introduced and used to estimate the end of an evolving bubble, using finite-time singularities of an approximate normal form near the bifurcation point. We test the forecasting skill of this method on different stochastic price realisations and compare with Monte Carlo simulations of the full system. Remarkably, the approximate normal form is significantly more precise and less biased. Moreover, the method of ghosts of singularities is less sensitive to the noise realisation, thus providing more robust forecasts.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Damian Smug</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195265</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde31:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>be8252c3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Damian Smug, Peter Ashwin, Didier Sornette&lt;/p&gt;

When some individuals are screen-detected before the beginning of the study, but otherwise would have been diagnosed symptomatically during the study, this results in different case-ascertainment probabilities among screened and unscreened participants, referred to here as lead-time-biased case-ascertainment (LTBCA). In fact, this issue can arise even in risk-factor studies nested within a randomized screening trial; even though the screening intervention is randomly allocated to trial arms, there is no randomization to potential risk-factors and uptake of screening can differ by risk-factor strata. Under the assumptions that neither screening nor the risk factor affects underlying incidence and no other forms of bias operate, we simulate and compare the underlying cumulative incidence and that observed in the study due to LTBCA. The example used will be constructed from the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial. The derived mathematical model is applied to simulating two nested studies to evaluate the potential for screening bias in observational lung cancer studies. Because of differential screening under plausible assumptions about preclinical incidence and duration, the simulations presented here show that LTBCA due to chest x-ray screening can significantly increase the estimated risk of lung cancer due to smoking by 1% and 50%. Traditional adjustment methods cannot account for this bias, as the influence screening has on observational study estimates involves events outside of the study observation window (enrollment and follow-up) that change eligibility for potential participants, thus biasing case ascertainment.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Rick J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Scuba diver fitness is paramount to confront environmental stressors of diving. However, the diving population is aging and the increasing prevalence of diseases may be a concern for diver fitness.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to assess the demographics, lifestyle factors, disease prevalence, and healthcare access and utilization of Divers Alert Network (DAN) members and compare them with those from the general population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;DAN membership health survey (DMHS) was administered online in 2011 to DAN members in the United States (US).

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with healthcare utilization among the DMHS participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to the general US population, the DMHS population had lower prevalence of asthma, heart attack, angina, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and disabilities (p&amp;lt;0.01); more heavy alcohol drinkers, and fewer smokers (p&amp;lt;0.01); and greater access and utilization (routine checkup) of healthcare (p&amp;lt;0.01). Healthcare utilization in males was lower than among females.

&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. are a leading cause of bacterial enteritis worldwide, including countries in Africa, and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of the high priority antimicrobial resistant pathogens. However, at present there is little knowledge on the prevalence, molecular epidemiology or antimicrobial susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolates in Botswana, both in patients and in the zoonotic context. Some data indicate that ~14% of diarrhoeal disease cases in a paediatric setting can be ascribed to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp., urging the need for the magnitude of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;-associated diarrhoea to be established. In this survey, we have characterised the genomic diversity of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. circulating in Botswana isolated from cases of diarrhoeal disease in humans (n = 20) and from those that colonised commercial broiler (n = 35) and free-range (n = 35) chickens. Phylogeny showed that the &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from the different poultry and human sources were highly related, suggesting that zoonotic transmission has likely occurred. We found that for &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from humans, broilers and free-range chickens, 52% was positive for &lt;i&gt;tetO&lt;/i&gt;, 47% for &lt;i&gt;gyrA&lt;/i&gt;-T86I, 72% for &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA-61&lt;/sub&gt;, with 27% carrying all three resistance determinants. No 23S mutations conferring macrolide resistance were detected in this survey.

&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. are a leading cause of bacterial enteritis worldwide, including countries in Africa, and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of the high priority antimicrobial resistant pathogens. However, at present there is little knowledge on the prevalence, molecular epidemiology or antimicrobial susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolates in Botswana, both in patients and in the zoonotic context. Some data indicate that ~14% of diarrhoeal disease cases in a paediatric setting can be ascribed to &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp., urging the need for the magnitude of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;-associated diarrhoea to be established. In this survey, we have characterised the genomic diversity of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. circulating in Botswana isolated from cases of diarrhoeal disease in humans (n = 20) and from those that colonised commercial broiler (n = 35) and free-range (n = 35) chickens. Phylogeny showed that the &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from the different poultry and human sources were highly related, suggesting that zoonotic transmission has likely occurred. We found that for &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. isolated from humans, broilers and free-range chickens, 52% was positive for &lt;i&gt;tetO&lt;/i&gt;, 47% for &lt;i&gt;gyrA&lt;/i&gt;-T86I, 72% for &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA-61&lt;/sub&gt;, with 27% carrying all three resistance determinants. No 23S mutations conferring macrolide resistance were detected in this survey. In summary, our study provides insight into &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. in poultry reservoirs and in diarrhoeal patients, and the relevance for treatment regimens in Botswana.</description><published>1521666000000</published><title>Phylogenetic analyses and antimicrobial resistance profiles of &amp;lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&amp;lt;/i&gt; spp. from diarrhoeal patients and chickens in Botswana</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3640.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3640.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3640.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>In the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP), protein misfolding leads to fatal consequences for cell metabolism and rod and cone cell survival.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a key regulator of brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis. The PPARγ gene produces two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. PPARγ2 is identical to PPARγ1 except for additional 30 amino acids present in the N-terminus of PPARγ2. Here we report that the C-terminally truncated form of PPARγ2 is predominantly present in the mitochondrial matrix of brown adipocytes and that it binds to the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which contains the promoter for mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) genes. Expression of mitochondrially targeted MLS-PPARγ2 in brown adipocytes increases mtDNA-encoded ETC gene expression concomitant with enhanced mitochondrial respiration. These results suggest that direct regulation of mitochondrially encoded ETC gene expression by mitochondrial PPARγ2, in part, underlies the isoform-specific role for PPARγ2 in brown adipocytes.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Ji Suk Chang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195007</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34c6:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>226260be</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Suk Chang, Kyoungsoo Ha&lt;/p&gt;

Academic misconduct/dishonesty has become widespread behavior among many university students across the globe, and medical education is not an exception. Until recently, few efforts have been made to study the dishonest behavior in Middle-Eastern universities. This study examined the prevalence and predisposing factors of cheating among medical students in Saudi Arabia and suggests suitable preventive measures. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at a government medical college during the 2014–2015 academic year. The response rate was 58.5% (421/720). The overall cheating behavior practiced by the participants was 29%, predominantly by male students. High GPA scoring students were the least likely to cheat. The participants living with their families were more likely to cheat compared to those who were living apart from their families. The reasons participants gave to justify their cheating behavior included getting better grades, passing the course, and lacking preparation while still recognizing that cheating is a ‘mistake.’ Overall, significant academic misconduct concerning cheating was found among the Saudi medical students; this misconduct is alarming in a reputable government institution. The implementation of strict punishments, requiring ethical courses and creating ethical awareness by exploiting the potential of Islamic religious belief might help to control this problem.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194963</canonicalUrl><engagement>13</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef11:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>394e370c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani, Shafiul Haque, Yousef Abdullah Almusalam, Saleh Lafi Alanezi, Yazeed Abdulaziz Alsulaiman, Mohammad Irshad, Shaffi Ahmed Shaik, Nehal Khamis&lt;/p&gt;

Almost one third of the three million people in China suffering severe deafness are children, and 50% of these cases are believed to have genetic components to their etiology. Newborn hearing genetic screening can complement Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening for the diagnosis of congenital hearing loss as well as identifying children at risk for late-onset and progressive hearing impairment. The aim of this joint academic and Ministry of Health project was to prototype a cost effective newborn genetic screen in a community health setting on a city-wide level, and to ascertain the prevalence of variation at loci that have been associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. With the participation of 143 local hospitals in the city of Wuhan, China we screened 142,417 neonates born between May 2014 and Dec. 2015. The variants GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G, and mitochondrial variants m.1555A&gt;G and m.1494C&gt;T were assayed using real time PCR. Newborns found to carry a variant were re-assayed by sequencing in duplicate. Within a subset of 707 newborns we assayed using real-time PCR and ARMS-PCR to compare cost, sensitivity and operating procedure. The most frequent hearing loss associated allele detected in this population was the 235delC variant in GJB2 gene. In total, 4289 (3.01%) newborns were found to carry at least one allele of either GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G or two assayed MT-RNR1 variants. There was complete accordance between the real-time PCR and the ARMS PCR, though the real-time PCR had a much lower failure rate. Real-time PCR had a lower cost and operating time than ARMS PCR. Ongoing collaboration with the participating hospitals will determine the specificity and sensitivity of the association of the variants with hearing loss at birth and arising in early childhood, allowing an estimation of the benefits of newborn hearing genetic screening in a large-scale community setting.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Zongjie Hao</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195740</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c3:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>70f1f354</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zongjie Hao, Denggang Fu, Yang Ming, Jinlong Yang, Qi Huang, Weilong Lin, Huan Zhang, Bin Zhang, Aifen Zhou, Xijiang Hu, Cong Yao, Yunping Dong, Huijun Z.

I have a Nature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03774-5&quot;&gt;“New and Views” comment&lt;/a&gt; on this one (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rdcu.be/KcUV&quot;&gt;free access link&lt;/a&gt;) for a broader audience, but I’ll expand on my thoughts here. &lt;em&gt;(Update: I’m also going on about this on a Nature podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acast.com/nature/29march2018-aiinchemistry-andliquiddropletsinlivingcells-?autoplay=true&amp;seek=49.873266&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the same general thoughts apply to this work as to the last one. What we have, via a team from Münster/BenevolentAI/Shanghai, is another piece of software that has picked up large numbers of possible synthetic transformations and has ways of (1) stringing them together into possible routes and (2) evaluating these against each other to elevate the ones that are deemed more desirable. Naturally, the response from many organic chemists to these things has been “But that’s what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; do”, followed by “Surely no program could do it as well”. The strong form of that latter objection is “Surely no program can do this to any useful extent at all”, and the weak form is “Surely no program can do it for all the molecules that we can”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to dispose of the strong-form objection immediately. Whatever you think of the idea, the programs in the last paper and this one (I’m getting to it!) are generating plausible synthetic routes. You may find them derivative of known ones; you may object that they’re not really any different than something that any competent chemist could have done. &lt;em&gt;But those are already victories for the software.&lt;/em&gt; You might also object, with varying degrees of justification, that the molecules and syntheses chosen are there to show the software in the best light, and that real-world use won’t be as fruitful. But that’s a holding action, even should it have merit: the fact that it can work at all turns the problem, if there is one, into optimizing something that already exists. As the history of chess- and Go-playing software shows, such piecing-together-strategies-and-evaluating-them tasks improve relentlessly once they’ve been shown to work in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That takes us well on the way to disposing of the medium objection, because if the programs aren’t doing this as well as a person can now, well, they will. And that also is an introduction into this new paper. You will have heard over the last two or three years about how Google’s (DeepMind’s) AlphaGo program was able to compete with and them beat the best human players of the game. Go is significantly harder to deal with computationally than chess, so this was a real achievement, and it was done partly by building in every human maneuver and strategy known. But last fall, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new program, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero&quot;&gt;AlphaGo Zero&lt;/a&gt;, that comes at the problem more generally. Instead of having strategies wired into it, the new program is capable of inferring strategies on its own. The software ran hours and hours of Go games and figured out good moves by watching what seemed to work out and what didn’t in various situations, and at the end of the process it beat the latest version of AlphaGo, the one that beats every human on the planet, &lt;em&gt;one hundred games in a row&lt;/em&gt;. It makes moves that no one has yet seen in human play, for reasons that Go experts are now trying to work out. (Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815&quot;&gt;latest iteration&lt;/a&gt;, as far as I know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chematica software I wrote about earlier this month is an example of the AlphaGo style: its makers have spent a great deal of time entering the details of literature reactions into it: this goes to that, but only if there’s not a group like X, and only if the pH doesn’t get a low as Y, etc. Synthetic organic chemists will be familiar with the reactivity tables in the back of the Greene protecting group book – that’s just the sort of thing that was filled out, over and over, and with even more detail. Without this curation, software of this kind tends to generate routes that have obvious “That’s not gonna work” steps in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new paper, though, appears to be in the AlphaGo Zero mode: the program digs through the Reaxys database (all of it) and infers synthetic transformation rules for itself. If this works, it could be a significant advance, because that data curation and entry is a major pain. There are at least two levels to such curation: the first (as mentioned) is capturing all the finer details of what is likely to work (or fail) in the presence of something else. The second goes to the reliability of the synthetic literature in general – you don’t want to feed reactions into the system that haven’t been (or can’t be!) reproduced by others. The way this new program deals with these is pretty straightforward: the first type of curation is handled by brute force processing of Reaxys examples, and the second by a requirement that only transformations that appear independently a certain number of times in the database are allowed into the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic synthesis is a lot harder to reduce to game-type evaluation than chess is, as the authors rightly point out. To get around this, the program combines neural-network processing with a Monte Carlo tree search technique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this work, we combine three different neural networks together with MCTS to perform chemical synthesis planning (3N-MCTS). The first neural network (the expansion policy) guides the search in promising directions by proposing a restricted number of automatically extracted transformations. A second neural network then predicts whether the proposed reactions are actually feasible (in scope). Finally, to estimate the position value, transformations are sampled from a third neural network during the rollout phase. The neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions published in the history of organic chemistry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength of the Chematica paper is that the routes were put to a real-world test at the bench. This new work didn’t go that far, but what the authors did do was have the program generate retrosyntheses for already-synthesized molecules, and then have these routes and the known ones evaluated blind by experienced chemists. The results were a toss-up: the machine routes were considered just as plausible or desirable as the human ones, and that (as above) is a victory for the machine. &lt;em&gt;AI wins ties&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-285x300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-285x300.jpeg 285w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-768x807.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-974x1024.jpeg 974w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-300x315.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route.jpeg 1136w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13412&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At right is an example of a route generated by the 3N-MCTS technique. That’s not a particularly hard molecule to make, but it’s not an artificially easy one, either. That is, in fact, an intermediate in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asianjournalofchemistry.co.in/user/journal/viewarticle.aspx?ArticleID=27_6_39&quot;&gt;published synthesis&lt;/a&gt; of potential 5-HT6 ligands, and the route the program found is identical to the one in the paper, so you can be reasonably sure that it’s valid. You or I would probably come up with something similar – I personally didn’t know that first spirocyclobutane step, but I would have done what the program basically did: look in Reaxys or CAS to see if something like that had been prepared. (Note that the program doesn’t memorize routes, just steps – it pieced this together on its own and declared it good). Note that the program delivered this one in 5.4 seconds, and none of us are going to beat that. Add up the total time we all spend on stuff like this and it starts to look like it’s cutting into other work, you know? If you’d like to see several hundred more schemes along those lines, they’re in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25978#s1&quot;&gt;the paper’s SI files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have two types of retrosynthesis software that (at least in some realistic examples) are if not better than humans, apparently no worse. Where does that put us? And by “us”, I mean “us synthetic chemists”. My conclusions from the earlier paper stand: we are going to have to get used to this, because if the software is not coming to take retrosynthetic planning away from us now, it will do so shortly. You may not care for that – at times, I may not care for it, either – but &lt;em&gt;it doesn’t matter what we think&lt;/em&gt;. If it can do even a decent job of stitching together and evaluating routes, the software will beat us on just general grasp of the literature alone, which some time ago passed beyond the ability of human brains to organize and remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the next step is more-than-decent ability to see and rate synthetic plans. Despite my comparison to AlphaGo Zero (which is valid on mechanistic grounds), it’s not that this new software is coming up with routes that no human would be able to. But if we’re approaching “good as a human”, the next step is always “even better than a human”. Eventually – and not that long from now – such programs are going to go on to generate “Hey, why didn’t I think of that” routes, but you know what? Those of us in the field now are going to be the only ones saying that. The next generation of chemists won’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will have outsourced synthetic planning to the machines. Retrosynthesis will remain a valuable teaching tool, and it will still be the way we think about organic chemistry. It will persist in various forms in the curriculum just as qualitative functional group analyses did, long after they died out in actual practice. Actual practice, meanwhile, will consist of more thinking about what molecules to make and why to make them, and a lot less thinking about “how”. That will only kick in for structures too complex for the software to handle, and that will be a gradually shrinking patch of ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will not go down easy for a lot of us. Thinking about how to make molecules has long been seen as one of the vital parts of organic chemistry, but knowing how to handle horses was long seen as a vital part of raising crops for food, too. It’ll be an adjustment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No memory of having starred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Atones for later disregard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Or keeps the end from being hard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s Robert Frost, and his advice in that poem was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://commonreader.wustl.edu/c/provide-provide/&quot;&gt;Provide, Provide!&lt;/a&gt;” We’ll have to.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><visual><width>1136</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>1194</height><url>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route.jpeg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>There’s yet another paper on computer-devised retrosynthesis out today – it and the previous one make an interesting pair.

Vitellogenesis is the process of yolk formation via accumulating vitellin (Vn) with nutrients in the oocytes. Expression of vitellogenin (Vg), the precursor of Vn, is one of the indicators for the start of vitellogenesis. In Pacific white shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Litopenaeus vannamei&lt;/i&gt;), the type-II vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone (VIH-2) effectively suppresses hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression. In this study, we demonstrate the increasing transcript levels of hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; during &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vannamei&lt;/i&gt; ovarian development, suggesting that the hepatopancreas-derived Vg/Vn may also contribute to vitellogenesis in this species. Using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; injections and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; primary cell cultures, we provide evidences that the inhibition of VIH-2 on hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; gene expression is mediated through a functional coupling of the GC/cGMP pathway with different MAPK-dependent cascades in female shrimp. In VIH-2 signaling, the NO-independent GC/cGMP/PKG cascades were upstream of the MAPKs. Activations of the MAPK signal by VIH-2 include the phosphorylation of JNK and the mRNA/protein expression of P&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;MAPK. Additionally, the cAMP/PKA pathway is another positive intracellular signal for hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression but is independent of its VIH-2 regulation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disease is characterized by abnormal bone development and early obesity. While the bone aspect of the disease has been thoroughly studied, early obesity affecting approximately 50% of them during childhood has been somewhat neglected. It nevertheless represents a major health problem in these patients, and is associated to life-threatening complications including increasing risk of cardiovascular pathologies. We have thus decided to study obesity in patients and to use the mouse model to evaluate if soluble FGFR3 therapy, an innovative treatment approach for achondroplasia, could also impact the development of this significant complication.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we have first fully characterized the metabolic deregulations in these patients by conducting a longitudinal retrospective study, in children with achondroplasia Anthropometric, densitometric measures as well as several blood parameters were recorded and compared between three age groups ranging from [0–3], [4–8] and [9–18] years old. Our results show unexpected results with the development of an atypical obesity with preferential fat deposition in the abdomen that is remarkably not associated with classical complications of obesity such as diabetes or hypercholosterolemia. Because it is not associated with diabetes, the atypical obesity has not been studied in the past even though it is recognized as a real problem in these patients. These results were validated in a murine model of achondroplasia (&lt;i&gt;Fgfr3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ach/+&lt;/sup&gt;) where similar visceral adiposity was observed. Unexpected alterations in glucose metabolism were highlighted during high-fat diet. Glucose, insulin or lipid levels remained low, without the development of diabetes. Very interestingly, in achondroplasia mice treated with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period (from D3 to D22), the development of these metabolic deregulations was prevented in adult animals (between 4 and 14 weeks of age). The lean-over-fat tissues ratio was restored and glucose metabolism showed normal levels. Treating &lt;i&gt;Fgfr3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ach/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period, prevented the development of these metabolic deregulations in adult animals and restored lean-over-fat tissues ratio as well as glucose metabolism in adult animals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrate that achondroplasia patients develop an atypical obesity with preferential abdominal obesity not associated with classical complications. These results suggest that achondroplasia induces an uncommon metabolism of energy, directly linked to the FGFR3 mutation. These data strongly suggest that this common complication of achondroplasia should be included in the clinical management of patients. In this context, sFGFR3 proved to be a promising treatment for achondroplasia by normalizing the biology at different levels, not only restoring bone growth but also preventing the atypical visceral obesity and some metabolic deregulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Celine Saint-Laurent</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793635:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>8c4a69f3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Celine Saint-Laurent, Stephanie Garcia, Vincent Sarrazy, Karine Dumas, Florence Authier, Sophie Sore, Albert Tran, Philippe Gual, Isabelle Gennero, Jean-Pierre Salles, Elvire Gouze&lt;/p&gt;

Background/Objectives &lt;p&gt;Abdominal obesity (AO) is associated with elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases; however, this association is less clear for non-obese people. We estimated the association of AO and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and disease in non-obese adult individuals from Chile.&lt;/p&gt; Subjects/Methods &lt;p&gt;5248 adults (15 years of age or older) of both sexes from the Chilean National Health Survey (October 2009 –September 2010, response rate 85%.) were included. Information on myocardial infarction and stroke was self-reported. BMI, waist circumference (WC), arterial pressure, plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels were measured. Predictive accuracy of WC was evaluated by area under curve of receiver operating characteristic analysis and cut off points were established by Youden Index. Relationship between AO and CVRF was analyzed by Chi-squared tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Normal weight/overweight/obesity were present in 34.4%/45.2%/18.1% of men and 33.4%/33.6%/27.5% of women. Predictive accuracy of WC to identify at least one CVRF was 0.70/0.67 and optimal cutoff points for WC in non-obese subjects were 91/83 cm in men/women, respectively. AO was present in 98.2%/99.1% of obese, 70.5%/77.4% of overweight and 12.4%/16.4% of normal weight men/women. AO was associated with increased frequency of CVRF in overweight men (6/8 and stroke) and women (4/8) and higher frequency in normal weight men (8/8 and myocardial infarction/stroke) and women (6/8 and myocardial infarction).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;WC cutoff points calculated for non-obese chilean population discriminate more differences in CVRF in normal weight woman. AO significantly increases the frequency of CVRF and diseases in overweight and especially normal weight individuals. WC can be used as a low cost, feasible and reproducible predictor for CVRF in non-obese individuals in most clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Beatriz Villanueva</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194644</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5eb:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>744df93c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beatriz Villanueva, Antonio Arteaga, Alberto Maiz, Víctor A.

Light causes damage to the retina (phototoxicity) and decreases photoreceptor responses to light. The most harmful component of visible light is the blue wavelength (400–500 nm). Different filters have been tested, but so far all of them allow passing a lot of this wavelength (70%). The aim of this work has been to prove that a filter that removes 94% of the blue component may protect the function and morphology of the retina significantly. Three experimental groups were designed. The first group was unexposed to light, the second one was exposed and the third one was exposed and protected by a blue-blocking filter. Light damage was induced in young albino mice (p30) by exposing them to white light of high intensity (5,000 lux) continuously for 7 days. Short wavelength light filters were used for light protection. The blue component was removed (94%) from the light source by our filter. Electroretinographical recordings were performed before and after light damage. Changes in retinal structure were studied using immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL labeling. Also, cells in the outer nuclear layer were counted and compared among the three different groups. Functional visual responses were significantly more conserved in protected animals (with the blue-blocking filter) than in unprotected animals. Also, retinal structure was better kept and photoreceptor survival was greater in protected animals, these differences were significant in central areas of the retina. Still, functional and morphological responses were significantly lower in protected than in unexposed groups. In conclusion, this blue-blocking filter decreases significantly photoreceptor damage after exposure to high intensity light. Actually, our eyes are exposed for a very long time to high levels of blue light (screens, artificial light LED, neons…). The potential damage caused by blue light can be palliated.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Javier Vicente-Tejedor</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194218</canonicalUrl><engagement>44</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e0f:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>43ed651b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Javier Vicente-Tejedor, Miguel Marchena, Laura Ramírez, Diego García-Ayuso, Violeta Gómez-Vicente, Celia Sánchez-Ramos, Pedro de la Villa, Francisco Germain&lt;/p&gt;

Niosomes are used in studies for drug delivery or gene transfer. However, their physical properties and features relative to liposomes are not well documented. To characterize and more rationally optimize niosome formulations, the properties of these vesicle systems are compared to those of liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids plus cholesterol. Niosomes are highly stable and only slightly more leaky than liposomes as assayed by calcein leakage; the permeability for ions (KCl) is higher than that of liposomes. Contrary to liposomes, the size of niosomes decreases substantially upon freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent thawing, as shown by cryo-EM and dynamic light scattering. The packing of niosomal membranes was determined by laurdan fluorescence and is slightly lower than that of liposomes. We did not succeed in the functional reconstitution of the L-arginine/L-ornithine antiporter ArcD2 in niosomes, which we attribute to the non-ionic nature of the surfactants. The antimicrobial peptides alamethicin and melittin act similarly on niosomes and liposomes composed of unsaturated components, whereas both niosomes and liposomes are unaffected when saturated amphiphiles are used. In conclusion, in terms of stability and permeability for drug-size molecules niosomes are comparable to liposomes and they may offer an excellent, inexpensive alternative for delivery purposes.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Rianne Bartelds</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194179</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7125:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>3667a9ec</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rianne Bartelds, Mohammad Hadi Nematollahi, Tjeerd Pols, Marc C.

Of these, malnutrition rate was 29.6%. Parenteral nutrition (251/344, 73.0%) was the primary nutrition support form in Chinese hospitals. However, 41.8% (136/325) of patients at nutritional risk or already diagnosed with malnutrition did not received any form of nutritional support, whereas 34.0% (155/456) well-nourished patients did. Patients with malnutrition had extended length of hospital stay and poor 30-day outcomes compared to well-nourished patients. Nutritional support could benefit nutritional risk or malnutrition patients, rather than well-nourished patients.

Understanding how neurons cooperate to integrate sensory inputs and guide behavior is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction (HD) system, we present evidence demonstrating how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised Machine Learning tool, can learn the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. We show how the method, unlike linear analysis, reveals that the coordination in thalamo-cortical circuits is qualitatively the same during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine Learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eLys5LrtLXM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006041</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006041</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1624ed0b0a5:56ecb:a077e55f</id><crawled>1521740722341</crawled><fingerprint>9b8ac515</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Viejo, Thomas Cortier, Adrien Peyrache&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Antenatal depression is associated with adverse maternal and infant well-being. However, compared to postpartum depression, it has been less frequently explored globally or in Jamaica. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, antenatal depressive symptoms among Jamaican women in order to inform policy and build interventions that could improve their management and reduce their negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This secondary analysis of data from the second Jamaican Birth Cohort Study (JA-Kids Birth Cohort) included 3,517 women enrolled during pregnancy. Information was extracted from interviewer-administered questionnaires which recorded social, demographic, medical and obstetric information during pregnancy. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) was used to screen for depression, with scores ≥13 considered indicative of a high likelihood of depression. Bivariate analysis examined associations between depressive symptoms and: age, income, financial difficulties, perceived social support, perceived partner infidelity, previous child-bearing unions and children with the current partner. Obstetric factors were also explored and included gravidity, prior adverse pregnancy outcome and complications from previous pregnancies. Variables that predicted the likelihood of depression based on an EPDS cut score of 13 were evaluated using logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One in five participants (19.6%; 95% CI 18.3–20.9%) had a high likelihood of antenatal depression (EPDS ≥13). Significant predictors of high depressive symptom severity included four indicators of poor perceived social and partner support [ORs (95% CI) ranged from: 1.61 (1.07–2.43); p = 0.024 to 3.14(1.69–5.84); p&amp;lt; 0.001], perceived partner infidelity [1.86 (1.36, 2.54); p&amp;lt;0.001], exposure to violence [2.36 (1.66–3.38); p&amp;lt;0.001] and financial difficulties [1.39 (1.07, 1.80); p = 0.013].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Women’s perceived social and partner support were strongly associated with depressive symptom severity. Within the Jamaican cultural context of unstable reproductive unions, efforts are needed to involve fathers in the antenatal care process to strategically improve the psychological well-being of new mothers which may positively influence long term developmental outcomes for their babies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Omotayo Bernard</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194338</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f5:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>9a39ecbf</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Omotayo Bernard, Roger C.

&lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; plays a significant role in the oligotrophic oceans, fixing nitrogen in an area corresponding to half of the Earth’s surface, representing up to 50% of new production in some oligotrophic tropical and subtropical oceans. Whilst &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; blooms at the surface exhibit a strong dependence on diazotrophy, colonies at depth or at the surface after a mixing event could be utilising additional N-sources. We conducted experiments to establish how acclimation to varying N-sources affects the growth, elemental composition, light absorption coefficient, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation, PSII electron transport rate and the relationship between net and gross photosynthetic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;erythraeum&lt;/i&gt; IMS101. To do this, cultures were acclimated to growth medium containing NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (replete concentrations) or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only (diazotrophic control). The light dependencies of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake were measured using membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS), while PSII electron transport rates were measured from fluorescence light curves (FLCs). We found that at a saturating light intensity, &lt;i&gt;Trichodesmium&lt;/i&gt; growth was ~ 10% and 13% lower when grown on N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Oxygen uptake increased linearly with net photosynthesis across all light intensities ranging from darkness to 1100 μmol photons m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The maximum rates and initial slopes of light response curves for C-specific gross and net photosynthesis and the slope of the relationship between gross and net photosynthesis increased significantly under non-diazotrophic conditions. We attribute these observations to a reduced expenditure of reductant and ATP for nitrogenase activity under non-diazotrophic conditions which allows NADPH and ATP to be re-directed to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation and/or biosynthesis.

Background &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a highly sensitive test for TB diagnosis, but still costly to most low-income countries. Several implementation strategies instead of frontline have been suggested; however with scarce data. We assessed accuracy of different Xpert MTB/RIF implementation strategies to inform national roll-out.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study of 1,924 adult presumptive TB patients in five regional referral hospitals of Uganda. Two sputum samples were collected, one for fluorescent microscopy (FM) and Xpert MTB/RIF examined at the study site laboratories. The second sample was sent to the Uganda Supra National TB reference laboratory for culture using both Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) and liquid culture (MGIT). We compared the sensitivities of FM, Xpert MTB/RIF and the incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF among patients negative on FM using LJ and/or MGIT as a reference standard.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total 1924 patients were enrolled of which 1596 (83%) patients had at least one laboratory result and 1083 respondents had a complete set of all the laboratory results. A total of 328 (30%) were TB positive on LJ and /or MGIT culture. The sensitivity of FM was n (%; 95% confidence interval) 246 (63.5%; 57.9–68.7) overall compared to 52 (55.4%; 44.1–66.3) among HIV positive individuals, while the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 300 (76.2%; 71.7–80.7) and 69 (71.6%; 60.5–81.1) overall and among HIV positive individuals respectively. Overall incremental sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 60 (36.5%; 27.7–46.0) and 20 (41.7%; 25.5–59.2) among HIV positive individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Xpert MTB/RIF has a higher sensitivity than FM both in general population and HIV positive population. Xpert MTB/RIF offers a significant increase in terms of diagnostic sensitivity even when it is deployed selectively i.e. among smear negative presumptive TB patients. Our results support frontline use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in high HIV/TB prevalent countries.

Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective. This study provides the groundwork for future studies concerning NMT-transcript-binding miRNAs, and will potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several important diseases.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Ranjit Chauhan</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5e9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>d2096ec8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ranjit Chauhan, David Datzkiw, Shailly Varma Shrivastav, Anuraag Shrivastav&lt;/p&gt;

Damaged cartilage has very low regenerative potential which has led to the search for novel tissue-engineering approaches to help treat cartilage defects. While various approaches have been reported, there is no perfect treatment currently. In this study we evaluated the effects of a plant extract, chlorogenic acid (CGA), as part of chondrocyte transplantation on a model of knee joint injury in chicks. First, primary cultured chondrocytes used to evaluate the effects of CGA on chondrogenesis. Then using an articular cartilage injury model of chick knee we assessed the functional recovery after transplantation of the complexes containing chondrocytes and CGA in an alginate scaffold. Histological analysis, PCR, and western blot were further used to understand the underlying mechanisms. We showed that 60 μM CGA in alginate exhibited notable effects on stimulating chondrogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Secondly, it was shown that the application of these complexes accelerated the recovery of injury-induced dysfunction by gait analysis when followed for 21 days. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that there was less abnormal vasculature formation, more chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage matrix synthesis in the presence of the complexes containing CGA. We discovered CGA treated transplantation up-regulated the expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 which were responsible for the stimulation of chondrogenesis. Furthermore, the application of these complexes could suppress the abnormal angiogenesis and fibrosis at the injury site. Lastly, the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, p-p65, and MMPs expression were decreased in the presence of CGA. This may be caused through adjusting cellular redox homeostasis associated with Nrf2. This study suggests that combining chondrocytes and CGA on an alginate scaffold can improve the recovery of damaged articular cartilage.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Xin Cheng</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195326</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460f:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>fc2b41b5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xin Cheng, Ke Li, Shengsong Xu, Peizhi Li, Yu Yan, Guang Wang, Zachary Berman, Rui Guo, Jianxin Liang, Sira Traore, Xuesong Yang&lt;/p&gt;

For each case up to 6 controls, matched for birth year and gestational age, were selected. The resulting study population consisted of 720 cases and 3,567 controls. Information on socioeconomic data about the mother, maternal morbidity, pregnancy related diagnoses, perinatal diagnoses of the infant, and procedures in the perinatal period, was obtained for all cases and controls and analyzed with univariable and multivariable logistic regressions for the whole study population as well as for subgroups according to gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the study population as a whole, we found independent positive associations with necrotizing enterocolitis for isoimmunization, fetal distress, cesarean section, neonatal bacterial infection including sepsis, erythrocyte transfusion, persistent ductus arteriosus, cardiac malformation, gastrointestinal malformation, and chromosomal abnormality. Negative associations were found for maternal weight, preeclampsia, maternal urinary infection, premature rupture of the membranes, and birthweight.

Anti-drug antibody formation occurs with most biological agents across disease states, but the mechanism by which they are formed is unknown. The formation of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab (AAA) may decrease its therapeutic effects in some patients. HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with autoantibody formation against interferons and other TNF inhibitors, but not adalimumab. We analyzed samples from 634 subjects with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS): 37 subjects (17 RA and 20 HS) developed AAA (AAA+) during adalimumab treatment and 597 subjects (348 RA, 249 HS) did not develop AAA (AAA-) during the clinical trials. Using next-generation sequencing-based HLA typing, we identified three protective HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1*05, HLA-DRB1*01,and HLA-DRB1*07) that were less prevalent in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 0.4, 0.25 and 0.28, respectively; and P values: 0.012, 0.012 and 0.018, respectively) and two risk HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*011) that were more abundant in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 2.52, and 2.64, respectively; and P values: 0.006 and 0.019). Similar to the finding of Billiet &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. who found that carriage of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was more prevalent in those with anti-infliximab antibodies (OR = 3.6, p = 0.002, 95% CI: [1.5,8.6]).), we found HLA-DRB1*03 allele was also more prevalent in anti-adalimumab positive (OR = 2.52, p = 0.006, 95% CI: [1.37,4.63]). The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Mohan Liu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195325</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f66:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>e08b35e8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohan Liu, Jacob Degner, Justin Wade Davis, Kenneth B.

The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab.</description><published>1522789200000</published><title>Identification of HLA-DRB1 association to adalimumab immunogenicity</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00125</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>111</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00125/20180321/images/medium/jm-2018-00125z_0013.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00125</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/e7IKVFu-ybU/acs.jmedchem.8b00125</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521604800000</published><author><name>Joanne Philp, Brian G.

The growing area of European hazelnut (&lt;i&gt;Corylus avellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is increasing, as well as the number of producing countries, and there is a pressing need for new improved cultivars. Hazelnut conventional breeding process is slow, due to the length of juvenile phase and the high heterozygosity level. The development of genetic linkage maps and the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to QTL (quantitative trait loci) of agronomic interest are essential tools for speeding up the selection of seedlings carrying desired traits through marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to enrich a previous linkage map and confirm QTL related to time of leaf budburst, using an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; population obtained by crossing Tonda Gentile delle Langhe with Merveille de Bollwiller. Genotyping-by-Sequencing was used to identify a total of 9,999 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Well saturated linkage maps were constructed for each parent using the double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. A reciprocal translocation was detected in Tonda Gentile delle Langhe between two non-homologous chromosomes. Applying a bioinformatic approach, we were able to disentangle ‘pseudo-linkage’ between markers, removing markers around the translocation breakpoints and obtain a linear order of the markers for the two chromosomes arms, for each linkage group involved in the translocation. Twenty-nine QTL for time of leaf budburst were identified, including a stably expressed region on LG_02 of the Tonda Gentile delle Langhe map. The stability of these QTL and their coding sequence content indicates promise for the identification of specific chromosomal regions carrying key genes involved in leaf budburst.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Daniela Torello Marinoni</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195408</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7693b:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>809ef603</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Torello Marinoni, Nadia Valentini, Ezio Portis, Alberto Acquadro, Chiara Beltramo, Shawn A.

Metabolic engineering focuses on rewriting the metabolism of cells to enhance native products or endow cells with the ability to produce new products. This engineering has the potential for wide-range application, including the production of fuels, chemicals, foods and pharmaceuticals. Glycolysis manages the levels of various secondary metabolites by controlling the supply of glycolytic metabolites. Metabolic reprogramming of glycolysis is expected to cause an increase in the secondary metabolites of interest. In this study, we constructed a budding yeast strain harboring the combination of triple sirtuin gene deletion (&lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆) and interruption of gluconeogenesis by the deletion of the &lt;i&gt;FBP1&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (&lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆). &lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆ cells harbored active glycolysis with high glucose consumption and active ethanol productivity.

Simulation is regarded as an effective educational method for the delivery of clinical scenarios. However, exposure to unfamiliar environments during simulation can cause excessive stress among students, possibly leading to unnatural speech/behavior and poor skill learning (Yerkes-Dodson’s law). Thus, assessing students’ stress in a simulation can provide educators with a better understanding of their mental state. This study sought to clarify stress changes throughout the progression of the simulation by measuring heart rate variability and students’ subjective reactions in 74 nursing students. Heart rate variability was calculated in terms of its high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) components during 4 phases—the break, patient care, reporting, and debriefing. Students were interviewed about stress experienced during the simulation. The results showed that HF decreased significantly from the break to the patient care and reporting phases. Furthermore, LF/HF increased significantly from the break to the reporting phases. Approximately 55 students felt stressed during the simulation, 24 of whom felt most stressed during the reporting phase. Therefore, the reporting phase involved high objective and subjective stress. It may be possible that the educator’s evaluative attitude increased students’ stress. Therefore, a stress intervention during the reporting phase might further improve students’ performance during that phase. The debriefing phase did not significantly differ from the break phase for objective stress, and students did not report feeling stressed. Thus, in this phase, they were released from the stress of the reporting phase and the unfamiliar environment. During this phase, they might be able to learn what they could not understand owing to high stress in the patient care and reporting phases. This study provides objective and subjective evidence of students’ stress during simulation, and indicates the necessity of providing support during the reporting phase and the importance of debriefing when using clinical scenarios for teaching clinical skills.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Natsuki Nakayama</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195280</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4607:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>22a1ebf2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natsuki Nakayama, Naoko Arakawa, Harumi Ejiri, Reiko Matsuda, Tsuneko Makino&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to conduct an indirect treatment comparison between cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel relative to comparators in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who progress on docetaxel-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) Intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83–1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69–1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41–75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03–10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14–206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Jon P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is considered a major worldwide health burden, with high mortality and associated costs. Health indicators are essential to define strategies to improve the treatment of diseases, and the epidemiology information of sepsis in developing countries is scarce. Thus, the aim of this work is to assess trends in the incidence, lethality, costs, and other indicators of sepsis for Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS—&lt;i&gt;Sistema Único de Saúde&lt;/i&gt;) hospitalizations for the period from January 2006 to December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted this study using data from the SUS hospital information system. We selected registries of SUS hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with sepsis (total of 724,458 cases from 4,271 public and private Brazilian hospitals).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2015, the annual sepsis incidence increased 50.5% from 31.5/100,000 to 47.4/100,000 persons. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 9.0 days. A total of 29.1% of the hospitalizations had admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a mean ICU LOS of 8.0 days. The mean cost per hospitalization was US$624.0 and for hospitalizations requiring intensive care was U$1,708.1. The overall sepsis lethality rate was 46.3%, and for hospitalizations with admission to the ICU, it was 64.5%. During the study period, the lethality rate for children/teenagers decreased 40.1%, but for all other age groups it increased 11.4%. The sepsis lethality rate in public hospitals (55.5%) was higher than private hospitals (37.0%) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The mean hospitalization LOS for public hospitals (10.3 days) was higher than private hospitals (7.6 days) (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incidence and lethality rate of sepsis increased in SUS hospitalizations during the study period. The SUS’s low reimbursement to hospitals for treating sepsis may be one of the reasons for the high lethality rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Ricardo Alfredo Quintano Neira</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793634:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>1add40aa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ricardo Alfredo Quintano Neira, Silvio Hamacher, André Miguel Japiassú&lt;/p&gt;

We selected registries of SUS hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with sepsis (total of 724,458 cases from 4,271 public and private Brazilian hospitals).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2015, the annual sepsis incidence increased 50.5% from 31.5/100,000 to 47.4/100,000 persons. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 9.0 days. A total of 29.1% of the hospitalizations had admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a mean ICU LOS of 8.0 days. The mean cost per hospitalization was US$624.0 and for hospitalizations requiring intensive care was U$1,708.1. The overall sepsis lethality rate was 46.3%, and for hospitalizations with admission to the ICU, it was 64.5%. During the study period, the lethality rate for children/teenagers decreased 40.1%, but for all other age groups it increased 11.4%. The sepsis lethality rate in public hospitals (55.5%) was higher than private hospitals (37.0%) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The mean hospitalization LOS for public hospitals (10.3 days) was higher than private hospitals (7.6 days) (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incidence and lethality rate of sepsis increased in SUS hospitalizations during the study period. The SUS’s low reimbursement to hospitals for treating sepsis may be one of the reasons for the high lethality rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523653200000</published><title>Epidemiology of sepsis in Brazil: Incidence, lethality, costs, and other indicators for Brazilian Unified Health System hospitalizations from 2006 to 2015</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194447</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194447</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194447</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Julie Rivière, Yann Le Strat, Pascal Hendrikx, Barbara Dufour&lt;/p&gt;
Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common disease of cattle and wildlife, with economic repercussions and implications for animal and human health. The surveillance of bTB in wildlife is particularly important, to shed light on the epidemiological role of wild species and for the adaptation of control measures. In France, a bTB surveillance system for free-ranging wildlife, the Sylvatub system, was launched in 2011 on wild boars, red deer, roe deer and badgers. It relies on active and passive surveillance activities, constrained by practical difficulties, such as the accessibility of wild animals, and regulatory rules for the trapping of badgers, for example. We report here the first assessment of stakeholders’ perceptions of the Sylvatub system and its acceptability, based on 20 individual semi-structured interviews with three types of stakeholder (collectors, coordinators, officers) in areas with different rates of bTB infection. With the caveat that these findings cannot be assumed to be representative of the national situation, we found that the Sylvatub system was considered useful by all the stakeholders interviewed. Those from the world of hunting participate in surveillance mostly to help livestock farmers, who are not systematically involved in bTB surveillance in wildlife. Many practical and regulatory constraints were raised, which could be offset by recognition of the work done by the “hunting community”, to maintain the willingness of these individuals to participate. We also identified a need for improvements in communication and information. Qualitative information, such as that collected here, is essential to improve our understanding of the reasons favoring and disfavoring participation in surveillance, and should be taken into account in the evaluation process. These results are relevant to hunters and to veterinary authorities wishing to identify the determinants of participation in the Sylvatub system. They could provide support for decision-making processes to improve surveillance strategies.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Julie Rivière</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194447</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a621:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>759063fa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julie Rivière, Yann Le Strat, Pascal Hendrikx, Barbara Dufour&lt;/p&gt;

Here we demonstrate the application of a method that could accelerate the development of novel therapies by allowing direct and repeatable visualization of cellular function in the living eye, to study loss of vision in animal models of retinal disease, as well as evaluate the time course of retinal function following therapeutic intervention. We use high-resolution adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy to image fluorescence from the calcium sensor GCaMP6s. In mice with photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), we measured restored visual responses in ganglion cell layer neurons expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin ChrimsonR over a six-week period following significant loss of visual responses. Combining a fluorescent calcium sensor, a channelrhodopsin, and adaptive optics enables all-optical stimulation and recording of retinal neurons in the living eye. Because the retina is an accessible portal to the central nervous system, our method also provides a novel non-invasive method of dissecting neuronal processing in the brain.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Soon Keen Cheong</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</canonicalUrl><engagement>61</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0e:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>8b125121</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Soon Keen Cheong, Jennifer M.

Recent data suggest the existence of a complement alternative pathway activation in the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a condition that remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Samuel Deshayes</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d74c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>f834d69c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Deshayes, Achille Aouba, Kathy Khoy, Delphine Mariotte, Thierry Lobbedez, Nicolas Martin Silva&lt;/p&gt;

These catalysts are typically complexes of platinum-group metals and their administration in vivo should be avoided.
Herein, we show how extraction of a hyperpolarized compound from an organic phase to an aqueous phase combined with a rapid (less than 10 seconds) Ir-based catalyst capture by metal scavenging agents can produce pure parahydrogen-based hyperpolarized contrast agents as demonstrated by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).

Tissue perfusion during surgery is important in reducing surgical site infections and promoting healing. This study aimed to determine if insufflation of the open abdomen with heated, humidified (HH) carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) increased visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature during open abdominal surgery in a rodent model. Using two different rodent models of open abdominal surgery, visceral perfusion and core temperature were measured. Visceral perfusion was investigated using a repeated measures crossover experiment with rodents receiving the same sequence of two alternating treatments: exposure to ambient air (no insufflation) and insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Core body temperature was measured using an independent experimental design with three treatment groups: ambient air, HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cold, dry (CD) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Visceral perfusion was measured by laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) and core body temperature was measured with a rectal thermometer. Insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a rodent open abdominal cavity significantly increased visceral tissue perfusion (2.4 perfusion units (PU)/min (95% CI 1.23–3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001) compared with ambient air, which significantly reduced visceral blood flow (-5.20 PU/min (95% CI -6.83- -3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001). Insufflation of HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the open abdominal cavity significantly increased core body temperature (+1.15 ± 0.14°C) compared with open cavities exposed to ambient air (-0.65 ± 0.52°C; p = 0.037), or cavities insufflated with CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (-0.73 ± 0.33°C; p = 0.006). Abdominal visceral temperatures also increased with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insufflation compared with ambient air or CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown by infrared thermography.

A dominant mechanism in the Judgment and Decision Making literature states that information is accumulated about each choice option until a decision threshold is met. Only after that threshold does a subject start to execute a motor response to indicate their choice. However, recent research has revealed spatial gradients in motor responses as a function of comparison difficulty as well as changes-of-mind in the middle of an action, both suggesting continued accumulation and processing of decision-related signals after the decision boundary. Here we present a formal model and supporting data from a number comparison task that a continuous motor planner, combined with a simple statistical inference scheme, can model detailed behavioral effects without assuming a threshold. This threshold-free model reproduces subjects’ sensitivity to numerical distance in reaching, accuracy, reaction time, and changes of mind. We argue that the motor system positions the effectors using an optimal biomechanical feedback controller, and continuous statistical inference on outputs from cognitive processes.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Santiago Alonso-Diaz</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195188</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4600:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>5f69c1c2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Santiago Alonso-Diaz, Jessica F.

We argue that the motor system positions the effectors using an optimal biomechanical feedback controller, and continuous statistical inference on outputs from cognitive processes.</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>A threshold-free model of numerosity comparisons</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-m?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-m?rss=1</link><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523554636000</published><author><name>Stajic, J.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/166.13.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:feced4:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-m?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>df0e2312</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Physics</item></keywords><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>A topological superconductor</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00185</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>183</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00185/20180321/images/medium/bi-2018-00185s_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00185</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/XbjIoRDRX2A/acs.biochem.8b00185</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521691200000</published><author><name>Xi Chen, Steven D.

Determining and understanding drug target engagement is critical for drug discovery. This can be challenging within living cells as selective readouts are often unavailable. Here we describe a novel method for measuring target engagement in living cells based on the principle of altered protein thermal stabilization / destabilization in response to ligand binding. This assay (HCIF-CETSA) utilizes high content, high throughput single cell immunofluorescent detection to determine target protein levels following heating of adherent cells in a 96 well plate format. We have used target engagement of Chk1 by potent small molecule inhibitors to validate the assay. Target engagement measured by this method was subsequently compared to target engagement measured by two alternative methods (autophosphorylation and CETSA). The HCIF-CETSA method appeared robust and a good correlation in target engagement measured by this method and CETSA for the selective Chk1 inhibitor V158411 was observed. However, these EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were 23- and 12-fold greater than the autophosphorylation IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. The described method is therefore a valuable advance in the CETSA method allowing the high throughput determination of target engagement in adherent cells.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Andrew J.

Assessment of researchers is necessary for decisions of hiring, promotion, and tenure. A burgeoning number of scientific leaders believe the current system of faculty incentives and rewards is misaligned with the needs of society and disconnected from the evidence about the causes of the reproducibility crisis and suboptimal quality of the scientific publication record. To address this issue, particularly for the clinical and life sciences, we convened a 22-member expert panel workshop in Washington, DC, in January 2017. Twenty-two academic leaders, funders, and scientists participated in the meeting. As background for the meeting, we completed a selective literature review of 22 key documents critiquing the current incentive system. From each document, we extracted how the authors perceived the problems of assessing science and scientists, the unintended consequences of maintaining the status quo for assessing scientists, and details of their proposed solutions. The resulting table was used as a seed for participant discussion. This resulted in six principles for assessing scientists and associated research and policy implications. We hope the content of this paper will serve as a basis for establishing best practices and redesigning the current approaches to assessing scientists by the many players involved in that process.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oSr6VqA7_WQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004089</href></item></canonical><engagement>59</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004089</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16272e5d344:b6d4a:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522346087236</crawled><fingerprint>f8091ef9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Moher, Florian Naudet, Ioana A.

Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in sheep and an example of a disease that may be controlled through breeding for disease resistance. Member states of the European Union have introduced strategies for breeding against scrapie based on the selection of genetically resistant breeding rams. An ambitious strategy adopted in The Netherlands consisted of selecting resistant rams for breeding throughout both breeding and production sectors. Mathematical modelling of the effect of a breeding program on the spreading capacity of scrapie in a national flock is needed for making assessments on how long a breeding strategy needs to be maintained to achieve disease control. Here we describe such a model applied to the Dutch situation, with the use of data on the genetic content of the Dutch sheep population as well as on scrapie occurrence in this population.

Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in sheep and an example of a disease that may be controlled through breeding for disease resistance. Member states of the European Union have introduced strategies for breeding against scrapie based on the selection of genetically resistant breeding rams. An ambitious strategy adopted in The Netherlands consisted of selecting resistant rams for breeding throughout both breeding and production sectors. Mathematical modelling of the effect of a breeding program on the spreading capacity of scrapie in a national flock is needed for making assessments on how long a breeding strategy needs to be maintained to achieve disease control. Here we describe such a model applied to the Dutch situation, with the use of data on the genetic content of the Dutch sheep population as well as on scrapie occurrence in this population. We show that the time needed for obtaining scrapie control depends crucially on two parameters measuring sheep population structure: the between-flock heterogeneity in genotype frequencies, and the heterogeneity of mixing (contact rates) between sheep flocks. Estimating the first parameter from Dutch genetic survey data and assuming scenario values for the second one, enables model prediction of the time needed to achieve scrapie control in The Netherlands.</description><published>1522184400000</published><title>Modelling of strategies for genetic control of scrapie in sheep: The importance of population structure</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194646</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194646</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194646</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francisco Javier García-De León, Carolina Galván-Tirado, Laura Sánchez Velasco, Claudia A.

So far I have yet to come across a drug discovery organization that really thinks that its compound libraries are what they should be – there are too many of those similar compounds from those similar projects that we used to be into back when, there are too many of those compounds that we purchased from vendors X and Y and Z, there are too many insoluble ones or decomposing ones or just plain boring ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s natural to think that the way to better screening results is to have a better compound collection – I mean, what could be more obvious? And it’s also obvious that every compound collection could always improve – it could be larger, or less greasy, or less streaked with legacy compounds that have too much baggage, etc. I don’t think it ever does harm to address these issues. The question is, how much good does it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask that question just because of the numbers involved. You have the numbers in your own collection, and you have the numbers in chemical space in general. The first is probably pretty large, and the second is larger than any human mind can deal with. Any one company’s compound collection – any one &lt;em&gt;planet’s&lt;/em&gt; compound collection – is a tiny mote in the sky of chemical space, even broadly druglike chemical space. So you’re not going to make much headway on the absolute scale, no matter how many diversity compounds you can get into vials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to the relative scale, then, you’re still going to have to make a pretty big effort to change your own collection’s character. This is why organizations have, over the years, tended to divide their collections into subfractions. Here are X thousand compounds to represent the deck as a whole – that’s something to use to try an assay out to troubleshoot it and get an idea of what the hit rate will be if you go on. Here’s the fraction of the deck that meets these particular biophysical criteria (and over here is the fraction of the deck that doesn’t). Here’s the fragment collection, here’s the more natural-product-like end of things, here’s the deliberately more three-dimensional set, and so on. In some (many?) companies, a classic screen-the-whole-deck situation has gotten more rare over the years, although there are always targets that need that and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up another consideration: sometimes you want more compounds because you’re not really getting any actionable hits in a screen (particularly against those tough targets). And sometimes you want more compounds because while you’re getting real hits, they’re not hits that you like. Maybe they’re from those legacy projects and the IP/selectivity considerations are too much of a hairball, or they’re coming out too nonpolar or with too few vectors for further optimization, what have you. You’d rather start somewhere else, and the deck doesn’t give you as many somewhere-elses as you’d want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the second category has a better chance of being fixed by adding swaths of new compounds – at least you know that the target is capable of binding small molecules. Now, it can always be the problem that the target just wants ugly chemical matter (CETP is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/06/29/the_cetp_rogues_gallery&quot;&gt;classic example&lt;/a&gt;), in which case there may not be much to do about it, but there will surely be other projects where something more workable presents itself. But the first category – just not getting hits – is a tougher situation. You can get stuck in an unprovable-hypothesis loop: if you didn’t get hits, you need more compounds. So you add more, and you didn’t get hits – well, you didn’t add enough, or the right ones. Who’s to say that the winner isn’t just over the horizon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a question that combichem was supposed to help answer back about twenty years ago or so, and it’s the question that its sequel, DNA-encoded library screening, is supposed to help answer now. From the beginning, the tricky part of the latter compounds sets has been the number of reactions compatible with the attached DNA barcodes. Combichem had that problem, too, in its early days: what price another ten thousand aryl amides? But (partly because of that grim experience) the DEL folks have been, right from the start, trying to expand their synthetic universe, and these efforts continue. My read so far on DEL screening is that it’s a very useful technique, but (as is always the case) not a magic bullet. People outside of drug discovery always seem to be amazed that we can screen a million compounds and not find something that binds to Target X, and they’d be even more amazed to know that you can run a whole series of DELs, containing (well, most likely) as many compounds as there are people on earth, and still not get a hit, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are also questions that DOS, diversity-oriented synthesis, was designed to help answer. I’ve always had &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/11/11/and_one_was_just_right&quot;&gt;reservations about that concept&lt;/a&gt;, but there have been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.2420&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30249-0&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; papers that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066158/&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt; to come out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392761/&quot;&gt;screening&lt;/a&gt; such collections. You can also see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171204/&quot;&gt;synthetic&lt;/a&gt; work &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.7b01776&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b06994&quot;&gt;reactions&lt;/a&gt; to make more diverse compounds sets feasible. Those papers, and more like them, are uncovered through a PubMed search on “Schreiber SL”, although there are others. One problem, though, is that a search for “diversity oriented synthesis” itself turns up both these papers and a mound of other stuff besides. There are an awful lot of papers that appropriate the term to mean “We made a bunch of stuff because we could and here it is”. The uncharitable view is that’s what the early DOS papers from the Broad added up to as well, but believe me, this other stuff is really the pits. When you see someone banging out a bunch of (say) chalcones and slapping a “diversity-oriented synthesis” label on the resulting work, well, it really makes you roll your eyes. Schreiber must love it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But has the DOS concept caught on outside the Broad Institute? It’s pretty labor-intensive, from a synthetic chemistry standpoint, although it’s designed to minimize that as much as possible once its time to actually make the libraries. But that’s a real “measure twice, cut once” situation; the last thing you want to do is rip into a big library synthesis that generates a bunch of half-made and truncated stuff instead of your desired Land of Diversity. I would like to have a better feel for how this is all working out. It may be that only organizations with significant manpower and funding can make a go of it, and significant bravery/nerve may be a requirement as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now DOS is, in the grand scheme of things, a series of shots into that gigantic chemical space mentioned above, and you could spend a lifetime at it and never make a dent in the number of untested areas – but (as above) is that the relevant question? The current version of it appears to be providing some interesting hits against interesting targets, and what more can you ask? It would be very worthwhile to study the hit rates (and hit quality) of DOS screening as practiced at the Broad versus what comes out of more conventional large compound collections, but if a large-scale comparison of this sort is publicly available, I’ve missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thoughts? How much effort is appropriate to beef up the screening collection, and what kind of return can one expect? Are you better letting the vendors clean out their closets and sell the stuff to you, or trying to make compounds yourself/pay someone to make them? What’s the comparative return on those? And the return versus and investment in DNA-encoded library technology (versus paying someone who does it already?) And does anyone do DOS-like stuff for themselves? Comments welcomed. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I’ve recently had similar questions from two different people (on two different coasts) about screening collections and compound libraries, so it seems like it could be a topic of interest.

Plastic pollution has been well documented in natural environments, including the open waters and sediments within lakes and rivers, the open ocean and even the air, but less attention has been paid to synthetic polymers in human consumables. Since multiple toxicity studies indicate risks to human health when plastic particles are ingested, more needs to be known about the presence and abundance of anthropogenic particles in human foods and beverages. This study investigates the presence of anthropogenic particles in 159 samples of globally sourced tap water, 12 brands of Laurentian Great Lakes beer, and 12 brands of commercial sea salt. Of the tap water samples analyzed, 81% were found to contain anthropogenic particles. The majority of these particles were fibers (98.3%) between 0.1–5 mm in length. The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99% were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg.

Increasing evidence indicates that the Golgi apparatus plays active roles in cancer, but a comprehensive understanding of its functions in the oncogenic transformation has not yet emerged. At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipid biosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, we analyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. We disrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as in increased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin D or Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Charlotte Luchsinger</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195401</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6f:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>4838f225</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charlotte Luchsinger, Marcelo Aguilar, Patricia V.

Background &lt;p&gt;In Kazakhstan, scarce official prevalence data exists for mood disorders. This study investigates the occurrence of depressive symptoms among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and the relationship between depressive symptoms, HIV treatment initiation and antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients seen at the Almaty AIDS Center between April and December 2013. Two data sources were used: 1) self-administered survey that included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to capture depression symptoms and 2) medical record review. Two primary outcomes were evaluated with log-binomial models and Fisher’s exact test: the relationship between depression symptoms and 1) HIV treatment group, and 2) HIV adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 564 participants, 9.9% reported symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder. None had received treatment for depression. Among those not on ART, a relationship between depressive symptoms and low CD4 counts (≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident (7.1% for CD4 ≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 0.9% for CD4 &gt; 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, p = 0.029). In multivariable analysis, a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms was statistically associated with ART treatment, positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) status, and being unmarried. For those taking ART, treatment adherence was not statistically associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms (12.5% vs 20.0%, p = 0.176); limited power may have impacted statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Untreated depression was found among PLWHA suggesting the need to evaluate access to psychiatric treatment.

We validated in cell lines the miR-199/miR-214 as a novel cluster of miRNAs promoting the triple negative subtype phenotype through its control of proliferation and EMT.</description><published>1522220400000</published><title>Identification of microRNA clusters cooperatively acting on Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Triple Negative Breast Cancer [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25064?af=R</originId><published>1522121650699</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25064?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25064?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626585320b:6ce1f:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522121650699</crawled><fingerprint>c5139ced</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288209v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288209v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288209v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Spliced peptides are short protein fragments spliced together in the proteasome by peptide bond formation.

Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells. To this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn&apos;s disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (p_rs102275=1.44e-20, p_rs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p&amp;lt;0.05).

In summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmunity.</description><published>1521702000000</published><title>Evidence for a potential role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmune disease risk using genome-wide analyses [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03598-x</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03598-x</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/NlhoP4yU9Nw/s41467-018-03598-x</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experimentally quantifying anion polarizability at the air/water interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimentally quantifying anion polarizability at the air/water interface, Published online: 03 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03598-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03598-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Understanding anion-specific interactions with hydrophobic interfaces is challenging due to an absence of local structural probes.

Amnion is a membrane surrounding the embryo/fetus which determine growth factors and interleukins with angiogenic, immunogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of conditioned culture medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion (hAM CCM) on migration and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial primary cells (HUVECs), freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs), and Jurkat leukemia cell line. Amnion membrane was freshly isolated from healthy placenta and its fragments cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to produce hAM CCM. Members of the IGFBP protein family made up one third of all assayed proteins present in the hAM medium. The hAM CCM did not affect the proliferation rate of HUVECs or MNCs, but we observed more intensive migration of those cells, and lower expression of CD31 surface antigen on HUVECs as compared to control cultures. In contrast, Jurkat cells did not respond to hAM CCM treatment by proliferation or mobility change. The conditioned medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion is easy to obtain and is a convenient source of various growth and other factors that may be useful in practical medicine.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Zofia Grzywocz</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195035</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1c:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>93b0fe42</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zofia Grzywocz, Grazyna Hoser, Stanislawa Sabalinska, Piotr Ladyzynski, Jaroslaw Czubak, Malgorzata Dworczynska, Romuald Debski, Ewa Pius-Sadowska, Boguslaw Machalinski, Jerzy Kawiak&lt;/p&gt;

Past and contemporary human actions are causing numerous changes in patterns and processes at various ecosystem scales and trophic levels, including unintended downstream changes, such as species interactions. In its native range &lt;i&gt;Acca sellowiana&lt;/i&gt; (Feijoa) combines some characteristics of human interactions: incipient domestication, restricted to subtropical Atlantic Forest highlands, associated with the threatened conifer &lt;i&gt;Araucaria angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Araucaria), within a domesticated landscape with anthropogenic forest patches, and provides fruit at a time of resource shortage (Araucaria seeds—&lt;i&gt;pinhão&lt;/i&gt;). We quantify the trophic relationships between Feijoa and vertebrates, and evaluate the influences on interactions caused by environmental variations, Feijoa domestication evidences, spatial distance and fruit availability. In four sites within protected areas, we selected 28 focal individuals of Feijoa (seven/site) and collected three temporal replicas between 2015 and 2016, when we measured productivity and frugivory via 45-second videos taken with camera traps. Using ecological network, rarefaction curves and variation partitioning analyses, we evaluate the frugivory network topology, the spatiotemporal structure of communities in relation to fruit availability and the influence of predictive variables on frugivory. We found a large spatiotemporal variation in productivity of Feijoa and that 20 species consumed Feijoa fruits, with a species degree of 2.8 (±5.7) and average Feijoa degree of 14.4 (±10.1), in a modular network with intermediary connectance. Rarefaction curves showed that richness and the independent records are congruent with the fruit amount. Variation partitioning showed that, for the focal individuals, canopy area, green coverage, patch size and distance to water influenced frugivory, and the Feijoa domestication influenced significantly the mammalian frugivory. Feijoa is an important resource that provides food during the time of year when &lt;i&gt;Pinhão&lt;/i&gt; is absent, and attracts frugivores, maintain the residual diversity of vertebrates contributing to the structure of communities in highlands. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the interactions between vertebrates and an incipient domesticated tree, in a cultural landscape and highly threatened environment, under a basal foodweb approach with implications for bottom-up and top-down forces. The results contribute to understanding animal-plant relationships, including concepts that can be replicated for other sessile prey and mobile predators in any region or habitat under different gradients of management. Thus, this work shows how human actions can change not only patterns of distribution and abundance but also the diversity and direction of interspecific interactions among species.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Juliano André Bogoni</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195199</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f3:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>3e325446</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juliano André Bogoni, Maurício Eduardo Graipel, Nivaldo Peroni&lt;/p&gt;

The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is an evolutionary conserved cholesterol binding protein localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Expression of TSPO is upregulated in activated microglia in various neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic disorders. Therefore, TSPO radioligands are used as biomarkers in positron emission tomography (PET) studies. In particular, a common A147T polymorphism in the TSPO gene affects binding of several high affinity TSPO radioligands. Given the relevance of TSPO as a diagnostic biomarker in disease processes, we systematically searched for mutations in the human TSPO gene by a wide array of evolution and structure based bioinformatics tools and identified potentially deleterious missense mutations. The two most frequently observed missense mutations A147T and R162H were further analysed in structural models of human wildtype and mutant TSPO proteins. The effects of missense mutations were studied on the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations. To analyse putative effects of A147T and R162H variants on protein stability we established primary dermal fibroblast cultures from wt and homozygous A147T and R162H donors. Stability of endogenous TSPO protein, which is abundantly expressed in fibroblasts, was studied using cycloheximide protein degradation assay. Our data show that the A147T mutation significantly alters the flexibility and stability of the mutant protein. Furthermore both A147T and R162H mutations decreased the half-life of the mutant proteins by about 25 percent, which could in part explain its effect on reduced pregnenolone production and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study is the first comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of genetic variants in the TSPO gene, thereby extending the knowledge about the clinical relevance of TSPO nsSNPs.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Vladimir M.

Psychological and other persuasive mechanisms across diverse contexts are well researched, with many studies of the effectiveness of specific persuasive techniques on distinct types of human behaviour. In the present paper, our specific interest lies in the development of a generalized modular psychometric tool to measure individuals’ susceptibility to persuasion. The scale is constructed using items from previously developed and validated particulate scales established in the domains of social psychology and behavioural economics. In the first study we establish the Susceptibility to Persuasion–II (StP-II) scale, containing 54 items, 10 subscales and further 6 sub-sub scales. In Study 2 we establish the scale’s construct validity and reconfirm its reliability.

Psychological and other persuasive mechanisms across diverse contexts are well researched, with many studies of the effectiveness of specific persuasive techniques on distinct types of human behaviour. In the present paper, our specific interest lies in the development of a generalized modular psychometric tool to measure individuals’ susceptibility to persuasion. The scale is constructed using items from previously developed and validated particulate scales established in the domains of social psychology and behavioural economics. In the first study we establish the Susceptibility to Persuasion–II (StP-II) scale, containing 54 items, 10 subscales and further 6 sub-sub scales. In Study 2 we establish the scale’s construct validity and reconfirm its reliability. We present a valid and reliable modular psychometric tool that measures general susceptibility to persuasive techniques. Since its inception, we have successfully implemented the StP-II scale to measure susceptibility to persuasion of IT security officers, the role of psychology of persuasion in cybercrime victims and general persuadability levels of Facebook users; these manuscripts are in preparation. We argue that the StP-II scale shows promise in measuring individual differences in susceptibility to persuasion, and is applicable across diverse contexts such as Internet security and cybercrime.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>We will make you like our research: The development of a susceptibility-to-persuasion scale</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195626</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195626</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195626</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Finn Nilson, Mats Börjesson&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, an increasing popularity of marathons has been seen. Although running has been shown to have considerable positive health effects, the risk of sudden death, most often due to sudden cardiac arrests, is also a risk runners expose themselves to. Whilst there are some studies on the mortality amongst long-distance runners, much of the evidence is dated. Given the increased popularity in running during the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century as well as the improvements in medical care at marathons, more knowledge is required on the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and method &lt;p&gt;Publicly available racing and news databases were used to identify the number of entrants and finishers in half to full marathons in Sweden between 2007 and 2016 and the number of deaths that occurred in conjunction with the races.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,156,271 runners entered a long distance (21-42km) running race in Sweden between 2007 and 2016, and 834,412 runners finished the races (72.2%). A large majority of the finishers (677,050 (81%)) competed in distances under a full marathon. Two deaths occurred during the time period, meaning that the death rate was 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.04–0.79) per 100,000 finishers.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study can show that death rates in long distance running races between 2007 and 2016 in Sweden are very low, compared to previous studies. When added to the existing literature, the combined picture suggests a general downward trend in the risk of death during marathons since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Finn Nilson</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195626</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529f:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>7183bd96</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Finn Nilson, Mats Börjesson&lt;/p&gt;

Recent comparative genomics studies have suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the major processes in bacterial evolution. In this study, HGT events of 64 &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; strains were investigated based on the pipeline employed in HGTree database constructed in our recent study. Tree reconciliation method was applied in order to calculate feasible HGT events. Following initial detection and an evaluation procedure, evidence of the HGT was identified in 548 gene families including 42 gene families transferred from outside of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydiae&lt;/i&gt; phylum with high reliability. The donor species of inter-phylum HGT consists of 12 different bacterial and archaeal phyla, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; might have even more various host range than in previous reports. In addition, each species of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; showed varying preference towards HGT, and genes engaged in HGT within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; and between other species showed different functional distribution. Also, examination of individual gene flows of niche-specific genes suggested that many of such genes are transferred mainly within &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genus. Our results uncovered novel features of HGT acting on &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genome evolution, and it would be also strong evidence that HGT is an ongoing process for intracellular pathogens. We expect that the results provide more insight into lineage- and niche-specific adaptations regarding their infectivity and pathogenicity.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Hyaekang Kim</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195139</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f45fc:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>f9fcd9df</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyaekang Kim, Woori Kwak, Sook Hee Yoon, Dae-Kyung Kang, Heebal Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests the presence of structural changes affecting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS). The aim of this study was to characterise the RV morphology in BrS and explore associations between morphologic, clinical, electrical, and genetic parameters using non-invasive multimodality testing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive BrS patients (recruited 2013–2015) underwent clinical assessment, dedicated RV imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (unless contra-indicated), electrical assessment (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG[SAECG]) and genotyping. Morphologic data were compared to matched control and unmatched ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) cohorts, and potential associations between morphologic parameters and other variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;BrS patients (n = 42, male 86%, age 46±12 years) exhibited normal global RV volume and function, comparable to control, in contrast to significantly larger, impaired RVs in ARVC cohort (RVESV p = 0.0001; RVEDV p&amp;lt;0.0001, RVEF p = 0.002). Compared with control, BrS patients exhibited larger RVOT volumes (7.4 ± 0.7 vs 5.8 ± 0.7 mL/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) (31% vs 0%, p = 0.005); compared with ARVC cohort, the RVOT volumes were similar (7.4 ± 0.7 vs, 8.1 ± 1.7, p = 0.52) and there were less RWMA (31% vs 76%, p = 0.01). Overall 67% BrS patients had abnormal RVOT morphology. Patients with abnormal RVOT tended to be older (48 ± 12 y vs 41 ± 12y, p = 0.06). Rare genetic variants were only observed in patients with abnormal RVOT morphology (36% vs 0%, p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with BrS frequently exhibit structural abnormalities localised to the RVOT and these changes may be age- and gene-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Belinda Gray</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179362a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>a2399181</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Belinda Gray, Ganesh Kumar Gnanappa, Richard D.
