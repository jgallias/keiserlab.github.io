TB infection in patients after kidney transplantation remains a concern in a successful long-term outcome. This retrospective, descriptive study was performed on tuberculosis infection after kidney transplantation in the Department of Infectious Disease of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, a tertiary care hospital in China, from January 2011 to April 2017, with the aim to explain the clinical features of active tuberculosis after kidney transplantation and explore the correlated factors for diagnostic delay and mortality. It included 48 cases. All these cases were followed up for at least 12 months after anti-tuberculosis therapy, except the ones who died during this period. The median time of transplantation to active tuberculosis of these 48 patients was about 5.4 years. The time from a first hospital visit to the diagnosis (diagnostic delay) of 12 (25%) cases was more than 30 days. The correlated factors for the diagnostic delay more than 30 days were a fever for more than 2 weeks and antibiotic use for more than 2 weeks. Nine (18.8%) cases died during the anti-tuberculosis therapy or following-up period due to TB relapse. The risk factors for mortality were severe complications, such as encephaledema, severe pneumonia, intestinal perforation, liver function failure, and the following multiple-organ failure. In conclusion, the possibility of tuberculosis infection should be carefully assessed and sometimes diagnostic anti-tuberculosis therapy may be required for patients who had a fever for more than 2 weeks or used antibiotics for more than 2 weeks after kidney transplantation. Severe complications and the following multiple-organ failure might increase the mortality among these patients.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195695</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wu, Meifang Yang, Min Xu, Cheng Ding, Yongtao Li, Kaijin Xu, Jifang Shen, Lanjuan Li&lt;/p&gt;

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the non–cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Françoise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/jN05gwz7zUk/article</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><author><name>Françoise Helmbacher</name></author><recrawled>1526494327964</recrawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4583</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4583.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4583.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1631d51f359:2877c64:fc1f8953</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Mechanisms of sampling interstitial fluid from skin using a microneedle patch [Medical Sciences]</title><crawled>1525205300057</crawled><published>1525190778000</published><fingerprint>c89c0f0d</fingerprint><author><name>Pradnya P.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid progenitor cells that are expanded in cancer and act as potent suppressors of the anti-tumor immune response. MDSCs consist of two major subsets, namely monocytic (M-) MDSCs and granulocytic (G-) MDSCs that differ with respect to their phenotype, morphology and mechanisms of suppression. Here, we cultured bone marrow cells with IL-6 and GM-CSF &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to generate a population of bone marrow MDSCs (BM-MDSCs) similar to G-MDSCs from tumor-bearing mice in regards to phenotype, morphology and suppressive-function. Through fluorescent labeling of these BM-MDSCs and optical imaging, we could visualize the recruitment and localization of BM-MDSCs in breast tumor-bearing mice &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that BM-MDSCs home to primary and metastatic breast tumors, but have no significant effect on tumor growth or progression. &lt;i&gt;Ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; flow cytometry characterization of BM-MDSCs after adoptive transfer demonstrated both organ-and tumor-specific effects on their phenotype and differentiation, demonstrating the importance of the local microenvironment on MDSC fate and function. In this study, we have developed a method to generate, visualize and detect BM-MDSCs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; through optical imaging and flow cytometry, in order to understand the organ-specific changes rendered to MDSCs in breast cancer.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196040</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jaclyn Sceneay, Christoph M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chromogranin A (CgA) is a plasma biomarker widely used in the follow-up of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). However, its accuracy as a tumor biomarker is relatively low because plasma CgA can increase also in patients with other diseases or in subjects treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of widely-used drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the attempt to identify a more reliable biomarker for NENs, we investigated, by ELISA, the circulating levels of full-length CgA (CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt;) and of various CgA-derived fragments in 17 patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs, 10 healthy controls, and 21 healthy volunteers before and after treatment with PPIs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs showed increased plasma levels of total-CgA and CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-76&lt;/sub&gt; fragment (vasostatin-1, VS-1) compared to controls [median (25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-percentiles); total-CgA: 1.85 nM (1.01–4.28) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.75 nM (0.52–0.89), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004; VS-1: 2.76 nM (1.09–7.10) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.29 nM (0.26–0.32), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, respectively], but not of CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt; or CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-373&lt;/sub&gt; fragment. VS-1 positively correlated with total-CgA (r = 0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve was 0.9935 for VS-1 and 0.8824 for total-CgA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.067). Treatment of patients with somatostatin analogues decreased both total-CgA and VS-1. In contrast, administration of PPIs increased the plasma levels of total-CgA, but not of VS-1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that plasma VS-1 is a novel biomarker for ileal and pancreatic NENs.

Channel catfish (&lt;i&gt;Ictalurus punctatus&lt;/i&gt;) is a highly adaptive species and has been used as a research model for comparative immunology, physiology, and toxicology among ectothermic vertebrates. It is also economically important for aquaculture. As such, its reference genome was generated and annotated with protein coding genes. However, the repetitive elements in the catfish genome are less well understood. In this study, over 417.8 Megabase (MB) of repetitive elements were identified and characterized in the channel catfish genome. Among them, the DNA/TcMar-Tc1 transposons are the most abundant type, making up ~20% of the total repetitive elements, followed by the microsatellites (14%). The prevalence of repetitive elements, especially the mobile elements, may have provided a driving force for the evolution of the catfish genome.

Unpasteurized dairy products are known to occasionally harbor &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and have been implicated in recent listeriosis outbreaks and numerous sporadic cases of listeriosis. However, the diversity and virulence profiles of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from these products have not been fully described. Here we report a genomic analysis of 121 &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from milk, milk filters, and milking equipment collected from bovine dairy farms in 19 states over a 12-year period. In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks.

Data and Methods: Somatic mutation profiles including 11,996 genes of 503 breast cancer patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) along with 11 clinical variables and markers of these patients were used to construct a binary third-order tensor. CANDECOMP/PARAFAC method was applied to decompose the constructed tensor into rank-one component tensors. Definitions of breast cancer verotypes were constructed from the patient, gene and clinical vectors corresponding to each component tensor. Patient membership proportions in the identified verotypes were utilized in a Cox proportional hazards model to predict their survival. Results: Qualitative evaluation of the verotypes obtained by tensor factorization indicates that they correspond to clinically meaningful breast cancer subtypes. While some components correspond to the known HER2- or ER-positive breast cancer subtypes, other components correspond to a variant of triple negative subtype and a cohort of patients with high mutation load of tumor suppressor genes. Quantitative evaluation indicates that the Cox model utilizing computationally discovered breast cancer verotypes is more accurate (AUC=0.5796) at predicting patient survival than the Cox models utilizing random patient membership proportions in cancer subtypes (AUC=0.4056) as well as patient membership proportions in genotypes (AUC=0.4731) and phenotypes (AUC=0.5047) obtained by non-negative factorization of the somatic mutation and clinical matrices.

Abstract &lt;p&gt;HIV-positive individuals that have a detected transmitted drug resistance (TDR) at baseline have a higher risk of virological failure with antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study offers an update on the prevalence of TDR in Slovenia, looks for onward transmission of TDR, and reassesses the need for baseline drug resistance testing. Blinded questionnaires and partial &lt;i&gt;pol&lt;/i&gt; sequences were obtained from 54.5% (168/308) of all of the patients diagnosed with HIV-1 from 2011 to 2016. Subtype B was detected in 82.7% (139/168) of patients, followed by subtype A (8.3%), subtype C (2.4%), and CRF01_AE (1.8%). Surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) were found in four individuals (2.4%), all of them men who have sex with men (MSM) and infected with subtype B. K103N was detected in two patients and T68D and T215D in one person each, corresponding to a prevalence of 0%, 1.2%, and 1.2% of TDR to protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-NRTIs (NNRTIs), respectively. The impact of mutations on drug susceptibility was found to be most pronounced for NNRTIs. No forward spread of TDR within the country was observed; however, phylogenetic analysis revealed several new introductions of HIV into Slovenia in recent years, possibly due to increased risky behavior by MSM. This was indirectly confirmed by a substantial increase in syphilis cases and HIV-1 non-B subtypes during the study period. A drug-resistant HIV variant with good transmission fitness is thus more likely to be imported into Slovenia in the near future, and so TDR should be closely monitored.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196670</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maja M.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is known to provide neuroprotective effect in the central nervous system. However, the detailed mechanism remains far more elusive. This study was designed to investigate the relevant mechanisms of DEX&apos;s neuroprotective effect. Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were injected with dexmedetomidine and/or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally, and inflammatory cytokines in serum and in the hippocampus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-κB in the brain tissue extracts was analyzed with western-blot. Then, we investigated whether NF-κB inhibitor prevents the elevation of inflammatory cytokines in rats injected with LPS. Our results indicated that compared with the control group, the rats exposed to LPS showed significant cognitive dysfunction. When compared to controls, the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the serum and hippocampus homogenate were increased in rats treated with LPS. DEX pretreatment inhibited the rats&apos; TNF-α, IL-6 and NF-κB levels induced by LPS. In response to LPS, PDTC pretreatment restrains the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). Rats treated with PDTC and DEX alongside LPS exhibited less TNF-α and IL-6 than the LPS treated group. In combination, PDTC and DEX showed addictive effects. Our data suggest that DEX exerts a neuroprotective effect through NF-κB in part after LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196897</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaobao Zhang, Fang Yan, Jiying Feng, Haitao Qian, Zhi Cheng, Qianqian Yang, Yong Wu, Zhibin Zhao, Aimin Li, Hang Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

In summary, we show that cNMF can increase the accuracy of cell-type identification while simultaneously inferring interpretable cellular activity programs in scRNA-Seq data, thus providing useful insight into how cells vary dynamically within cell-types.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196938</originId><updated>1525381200000</updated><engagement>294</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196938</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af1:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Longevity of outstanding sporting achievers: Mind versus muscle</title><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><fingerprint>a6f5d3b0</fingerprint><author><name>An Tran-Duy</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by An Tran-Duy, David C.

Background &lt;p&gt;While there is strong evidence showing the survival advantage of elite athletes, much less is known about those engaged in mind sports such as chess. This study aimed to examine the overall as well as regional survival of International Chess Grandmasters (GMs) with a reference to the general population, and compare relative survival (RS) of GMs with that of Olympic medallists (OMs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Information on 1,208 GMs and 15,157 OMs, respectively, from 28 countries were extracted from the publicly available data sources. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rates of the GMs. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust the survival for region, year at risk, age at risk and sex, and to estimate the life expectancy of the GMs. The RS rate was computed by matching each GM or OM by year at risk, age at risk and sex to the life table of the country the individual represented.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The survival rates of GMs at 30 and 60 years since GM title achievement were 87% and 15%, respectively. The life expectancy of GMs at the age of 30 years (which is near the average age when they attained a GM title) was 53.6 ([95% CI]: 47.7–58.5) years, which is significantly greater than the overall weighted mean life expectancy of 45.9 years for the general population. Compared to Eastern Europe, GMs in North America (HR [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.29–0.88]) and Western Europe (HR [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.34–0.83]) had a longer lifespan. The RS analysis showed that both GMs and OMs had a significant survival advantage over the general population, and there was no statistically significant difference in the RS of GMs (RS [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.08–1.20]) compared to OMs: (RS [95% CI]: 1.09 [1.07–1.11]) at 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Elite chess players live longer than the general population and have a similar survival advantage to elite competitors in physical sports.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by An Tran-Duy, David C.

&lt;i&gt;Grapevine Pinot gris virus&lt;/i&gt; (GPGV) is a widely distributed grapevine pathogen that has been associated to the grapevine leaf mottling and deformation disease. With the aim of better understanding the disease epidemiology and providing efficient control strategies a specific and quantitative duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay has been developed. This method has allowed reliable quantitation of the GPGV titer ranging from 30 up to 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; transcript copies, with a detection limit of 70 viral copies in plant material. The assay targets a grapevine internal control that reduces the occurrence of false negative results, thus increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of the technique. Viral isolates both associated and non-associated to symptoms from Greece, Slovakia and Spain have been successfully detected. The method has also been applied to the absolute quantitation of GPGV in its putative transmission vector &lt;i&gt;Colomerus vitis&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the viral titer present in single mites has been determined. In addition, in the current study a new polymorphism in the GPGV genome responsible for a shorter movement protein has been found. A phylogenetic study based on this genomic region has shown a high variability among Spanish isolates and points to a different evolutionary origin of this new polymorphism. The methodology here developed opens new possibilities for basic and epidemiological studies as well as for the establishment of efficient control strategies.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197237</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Félix Morán, Antonio Olmos, Leonidas Lotos, Lukáš Predajňa, Nikolaos Katis, Miroslav Glasa, Varvara Maliogka, Ana B.

Results: We developed Skyhawk, an artificial neural network-based discriminator that mimics the process of expert review on clinically significant genomics variants. Skyhawk runs in less than one minute to review ten thousand variants, and among the false positive singletons identified by GATK HaplotypeCaller, UnifiedGenotyper and 16GT in the HG005 GIAB sample, 79.7% were rejected by Skyhawk.

In higher plants, ω-3 fatty acid desaturases are the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3), which plays key roles in plant metabolism as a structural component of both storage and membrane lipids. Here, the first ω-3 fatty acid desaturase gene was identified and characterized from oil palm. The bioinformatic analysis indicated it encodes a temperature-sensitive chloroplast ω-3 fatty acid desaturase, designated as &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt;. The expression analysis revealed that &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in the oil palm leaves, when compared with the expression in the mesocarp. The heterologous expression of &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; in yeast resulted in the production of a novel fatty acid 18:3 (about 0.27%), when fed with 18:2 in the induction culture. Furthermore, to detect whether &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; could be induced by the environment stress, we detected the expression efficiency of the &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis treated with low temperature and darkness, respectively. The results indicated that the promoter of &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; gene could be significantly induced by low temperature and slightly induced by darkness.

Comparing different networks to each other revealed commonalities between them and biological pathways distinct genomic alterations converge on, highlighting the critical signaling events tumor dysregulate through multiple mechanisms. Finally, mutations inducing common changes to the signaling network were used to search for genomic markers of drug response, connecting shared perturbations to differential drug response.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/439/eaan1217.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/439/eaan1217?rss=1</originId><engagement>43</engagement><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/439/eaan1217?rss=1</link><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_163220f502f:675d34:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>[Research Articles] Microbial ecology perturbation in human IgA deficiency</title><crawled>1525284818991</crawled><published>1525283403000</published><fingerprint>5103d9b8</fingerprint><author><name>Fadlallah, J., El Kafsi, H., Sterlin, D., Juste, C., Parizot, C., Dorgham, K., Autaa, G., Gouas, D., Almeida, M., Lepage, P., Pons, N., Le Chatelier, E., Levenez, F., Kennedy, S., Galleron, N., de Barros, J.-P.

I went into its history a bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/02/tecfideras_price&quot;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re wondering how a molecule that small and unfunctionalized became a multiple sclerosis drug. As that shows, it went into trials for the disease with quite a bit of clinical rationale, but no clear molecular mechanism. So how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/449&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; has what could be the solution. It’s long been suspected that there’s a covalent mechanism at work, since the compound is an unsaturated small methyl ester (and thus potentially reactive with nucleophiles like cysteine). The history of allergic reactions in some patients fits in with that idea as well – you’d have to imagine that if it’s reacting with Cys residues that it’s capable of reacting with quite a few of them. One suspect had been a protein called KEAP1, which (along with its partner Nrf2) is a key player in inflammation, but that alone doesn’t seem to account for the drug’s effects. But now it looks like a more mechanistically important one has been tracked down: Cys150 of the enzyme GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one, as many will recognize, is responsible for a step in the glycolysis pathway. Why should messing with metabolism help out MS patients (and psoriasis patients as well, the drug’s original market)? Glycolysis is actually important for immune cell function: if you block it, macrophages cannot activate. The cell types affected after Tecfidera treatment are just those that are the most glycolitic (such as effector T cells), while Treg cells (among others) are left alone. Overall, the population of immune cells gets shifted around in ways that benefit autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates this in a number of convincing ways: if you incubate the enzyme with dimethyl or monomethyl fumarate, you can see the new mass adduct. And you see the same modified protein if you isolate GAPDH from the blood mononuclear cells of patients who have been taking Tecfidera for months as well. You get the same results from cell cultures and by dosing mice. The isolated enzyme shows dose- and time-dependent inhibition on treatment with either fumarate &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Looking more closely at the cells, the compound shows its effects on glycolysis in activated macrophages and lymphocytes, but not in resting cells, as shown by several downstream markers. This treatment also abrogates their immune functions (as shown by their response to the classic LPS antigen), and you can reproduce all these effects with a known GAPDH inhibitor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abcam.com/heptelidic-acid-koningic-acid-ab144269.html&quot;&gt;heptelidic&lt;/a&gt; acid). So yeah, this appears to be pretty nailed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also noted that fumarate is actually a downstream product of glycolysis, so it may be that dimethyl fumarate is just a prodrug for getting product inhibition of the pathway as well. None of this rules out other enzymes being modified by it, though – in fact, given its size and simplicity, other enzymes surely are. And the GAPDH-driven effects in other cells may also be important (it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4427661/&quot;&gt;already been suggested&lt;/a&gt; that it has metabolic effects in oligodendrocytes, although the mechanism wasn’t figured out). So what we have here is a small, simple, promiscuous covalent-inhibitor molecule that inactivates a ubiquitous enzyme that’s crucial to metabolic activity. And it’s a beneficial drug with a useful therapeutic index. Go figure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068918/&quot;&gt;a recent chemical proteomics effort&lt;/a&gt; on dimethyl fumarate, which identified a number of potential binding sites – but not this one on GAPDH! That’s worth thinking about (from both directions) and these sorts of disconnects may turn into a future blog post. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Because many medical conditions progress asymptomatically over extended periods of time, their timely diagnosis remains difficult, and this adversely affects patient prognosis. Focusing on hypercalcemia associated with cancer, we aimed to develop a synthetic biology-inspired biomedical tattoo using engineered cells that would (i) monitor long-term blood calcium concentration, (ii) detect onset of mild hypercalcemia, and (iii) respond via subcutaneous accumulation of the black pigment melanin to form a visible tattoo. For this purpose, we designed cells containing an ectopically expressed calcium-sensing receptor rewired to a synthetic signaling cascade that activates expression of transgenic tyrosinase, which produces melanin in response to persistently increased blood Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

The methodology we present in this work could be used by many researchers in their ongoing analyses making it a popular and useful tool.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25502-9</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25502-9</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f1e1e3e:1467eb:3dd877af</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>A bivalent protein r-PB, comprising PA and BclA immunodominant regions for comprehensive protection against Bacillus anthracis</title><crawled>1525772328510</crawled><published>1525762800000</published><fingerprint>293d65f7</fingerprint><author><name>Saugata Majumder</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bivalent protein r-PB, comprising PA and BclA immunodominant regions for comprehensive protection against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bivalent protein r-PB, comprising PA and BclA immunodominant regions for comprehensive protection against &amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus anthracis&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25502-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25502-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A bivalent protein r-PB, comprising PA and BclA immunodominant regions for comprehensive protection against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/IYMLwaGbkzc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bivalent protein r-PB, comprising PA and BclA immunodominant regions for comprehensive protection against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bivalent protein r-PB, comprising PA and BclA immunodominant regions for comprehensive protection against &amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus anthracis&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25502-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25502-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A bivalent protein r-PB, comprising PA and BclA immunodominant regions for comprehensive protection against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/IYMLwaGbkzc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/IYMLwaGbkzc/s41598-018-25502-9</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25502-9</href></item></canonical><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25502-9/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25502_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>324</height></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00289</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00289</link><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_16307e6d678:3dbb4:ed160cc3</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>[ASAP] Structure-Based Design of Inhibitors Targeting PrfA, the Master Virulence Regulator of Listeria monocytogenes</title><crawled>1524845958776</crawled><published>1524801600000</published><fingerprint>5eb169ee</fingerprint><author><name>Martina Kulén, Marie Lindgren, Sabine Hansen, Andrew G.

Chua Jr., Gary J. Schwartz, Young-Hwan Jo&lt;/p&gt;
Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) respond to numerous hormonal and neural signals, resulting in changes in food intake. Here, we demonstrate that ARC POMC neurons express capsaicin-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1)-like receptors. To show expression of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons, we use single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, TRPV1 knock-out (KO), and TRPV1-Cre knock-in mice. A small elevation of temperature in the physiological range is enough to depolarize ARC POMC neurons. This depolarization is blocked by the TRPV1 receptor antagonist and by &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene knockdown. Capsaicin-induced activation reduces food intake that is abolished by a melanocortin receptor antagonist. To selectively stimulate TRPV1-like receptor-expressing ARC POMC neurons in the ARC, we generate an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) carrying a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) expression cassette under the control of the two neuronal POMC enhancers (nPEs). Optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons decreases food intake. Hypothalamic temperature is rapidly elevated and reaches to approximately 39 °C during treadmill running. This elevation is associated with a reduction in food intake. Knockdown of the &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt; gene exclusively in ARC POMC neurons blocks the feeding inhibition produced by increased hypothalamic temperature. Taken together, our findings identify a melanocortinergic circuit that links acute elevations in hypothalamic temperature with acute reductions in food intake.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LGEs5NFlL1s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Hoon Jeong, Dong Kun Lee, Shun-Mei Liu, Streamson C.

We report a computational model for the assembly of HIV-1 Gag into immature viral particles at the plasma membrane. To reproduce experimental structural and kinetic properties of assembly, a process occurring on the order of minutes, a coarse-grained representation consisting of a single particle per Gag molecule is developed. The model uses information relating the functional interfaces implicated in Gag assembly, results from cryo electron-tomography, and biophysical measurements from fluorescence microscopy, such as the dynamics of Gag assembly at single virions. These experimental constraints eliminated many classes of potential interactions, and narrowed the model to a single interaction scheme with two non-equivalent interfaces acting to form Gags into a hexamer, and a third interface acting to link hexamers together. This model was able to form into a hexameric structure with correct lattice spacing and reproduced biologically relevant growth rates. We explored the effect of genomic RNA seeding punctum growth, finding that RNA may be a factor in locally concentrating Gags to initiate assembly. The simulation results infer that completion of assembly cannot be governed simply by Gag binding kinetics. However the addition of membrane curvature suggests that budding of the virion from the plasma membrane could factor into slowing incorporation of Gag at an assembly site resulting in virions of the same size and number of Gag molecules independent of Gag concentration or the time taken to complete assembly. To corroborate the results of our simulation model, we developed an analytic model for Gag assembly finding good agreement with the simulation results.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196133</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael D.

To corroborate the results of our simulation model, we developed an analytic model for Gag assembly finding good agreement with the simulation results.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197279</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197279</originId><updated>1525986000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197279</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e7:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Development and preliminary validation of a Korean version of the Personal Relative Deprivation Scale</title><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><fingerprint>f85971fd</fingerprint><author><name>Hyunji Kim</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunji Kim, Eunbee Kim, Eunkook M.

The current research developed and validated a Korean-translated version of the Personal Relative Deprivation Scale (PRDS). The PRDS measures individual differences in people’s tendencies to feel resentful about what they have compared to what other people like them have. Across 2 studies, Exploratory Factor Analyses revealed that the two reverse-worded items from the original PRDS did not load onto the primary factor for the Korean-translated PRDS. A reduced 3-item Korean PRDS, however, showed good convergent validity. Replicating previous findings using Western samples, greater tendencies to make social comparisons of abilities (but not opinions) were associated with higher PRDS (Studies 1 and 2), and participants scoring higher on the 3-item Korean PRDS were more materialistic (Studies 1 and 2), reported worse physical health (Study 1), had lower self-esteem (Study 2) and experienced higher stress (Study 2).</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197279</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunji Kim, Eunbee Kim, Eunkook M.

Secreted Nano-luciferase (secNluc) is a newly engineered secreted luciferase that possesses advantages of high structural stability, long half-life, and glow-type kinetics together with high light emission intensity, and thus would become one of the most valuable tools for bioluminescence assays. However, like other secreted luciferases, secNluc has to mix with the components in the conditioned medium surrounding test cells, or in the biological samples such as blood or urine after being secreted. These components may interfere with secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions and thus limit the application of the secNluc reporter system. In this study, we first examined the effects of three factors, pH, serum and residual reagents, on secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions, finding that these factors could interfere with bioluminescence reactions and result in background signal. To resolve these problems, we applied a simple affinity purification strategy in which secNluc was fused with a FLAG-tag, and anti-FLAG magnetic beads were used to catch and transfer the fusion protein to PBST, an optimal buffer for secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions that was identified in this study. The results indicated that this strategy could not only negate the interferences from serum or residual reagents and enhance the stability of light emission but also greatly increase signal intensity through enzyme enrichment. This strategy may contribute to biomedical studies that utilize secNluc and other secreted luciferases, especially those requiring superior sensitivity, low background noise and high reproducibility.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196617</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by JingZhe Li, ZhiLan Guo, Takashi Sato, Bo Yuan, YanYan Ma, Dan Qian, JuYing Zhong, MengMeng Jin, Peng Huang, LuYang Che, Yi Wang, Yan Lei, ChangZhen Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Goat breeding has become an important sector in Eastern Europe, with Romania and Hungary being among the major producer countries. Given the limited number of research done up-to-date concerning genetic studies of indigenous goat breeds reared in Romania and Hungary, the current preliminary study aimed to analyze the variability of genes related to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP™). We studied 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to 19 genes in indigenous breeds from both countries, namely Banat’s White (n = 36), Carpatina (n = 35) from Romania and Hungarian Milking (n = 79) and identified 16 polymorphic SNPs among 10 genes (&lt;i&gt;PTX3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLEC4E&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNFSF13&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TLR3&lt;/i&gt;) in 150 animals. Furthermore, the diversity of the studied breeds was investigated. The PIC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.691. The mean values of observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.235 and 0.246 respectively. The highest observed heterozygosity was obtained for &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T in Banat’s White (0.464), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T in Carpatina (0.577) and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G in Hungarian Milking (0.588). Pairwise F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values between the Romanian breeds and Romanian and Hungarian breeds were small (0.009 and 0.015), indicating the close relationship among the studied goat populations. From all the polymorphic SNPs identified, the Hungarian Milking breed showed the highest proportion of polymorphisms (100%), whereas the Carpatina breed had the lowest percentage (87.5%). The highest value of MAF was obtained for &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G (0.46), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T (0.47), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10344025C&gt;T (0.45), and &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T (0.42).

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne bacterial infection that is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. If not treated with antibiotics during the early stages of infection, disseminated infection can spread to the central nervous system (CNS). In non-human primates (NHPs) it has been demonstrated that the leptomeninges are among the tissues colonized by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; spirochetes. Although the NHP model parallels aspects of human borreliosis, a small rodent model would be ideal to study the trafficking of spirochetes and immune cells into the CNS. Here we show that during early and late disseminated infection, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; infects the meninges of intradermally infected mice, and is associated with concurrent increases in meningeal T cells. We found that the dura mater was consistently culture positive for spirochetes in transcardially perfused mice, independent of the strain of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; used. Within the dura mater, spirochetes were preferentially located in vascular regions, but were also present in perivascular, and extravascular regions, as late as 75 days post-infection. At the same end-point, we observed significant increases in the number of CD3+ T cells within the pia and dura mater, as compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes isolated from the dura mater revealed that CD3+ cell populations were comprised of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that similarly to infection in peripheral tissues, spirochetes adhere to the dura mater during disseminated infection, and are associated with increases in the number of meningeal T cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are aspects of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; meningeal infection that can be modelled in laboratory mice, suggesting that mice may be useful for elucidating mechanisms of meningeal pathogenesis by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196893</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Divan, Timothy Casselli, S.

Plants possess two different RAB5 groups, canonical and plant-unique types, which act via unknown counteracting mechanisms. Here, we identified an effector molecule of the plant-unique RAB5 in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, ARA6, which we designated PLANT-UNIQUE RAB5 EFFECTOR 2 (PUF2). Preferential colocalization with canonical RAB5 on endosomes and genetic interaction analysis indicated that PUF2 coordinates vacuolar transport with canonical RAB5, although PUF2 was identified as an effector of ARA6. Competitive binding of PUF2 with GTP-bound ARA6 and GDP-bound canonical RAB5, together interacting with the shared activating factor VPS9a, showed that ARA6 negatively regulates canonical RAB5-mediated vacuolar transport by titrating PUF2 and VPS9a.

Plants possess two different RAB5 groups, canonical and plant-unique types, which act via unknown counteracting mechanisms. Here, we identified an effector molecule of the plant-unique RAB5 in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, ARA6, which we designated PLANT-UNIQUE RAB5 EFFECTOR 2 (PUF2). Preferential colocalization with canonical RAB5 on endosomes and genetic interaction analysis indicated that PUF2 coordinates vacuolar transport with canonical RAB5, although PUF2 was identified as an effector of ARA6. Competitive binding of PUF2 with GTP-bound ARA6 and GDP-bound canonical RAB5, together interacting with the shared activating factor VPS9a, showed that ARA6 negatively regulates canonical RAB5-mediated vacuolar transport by titrating PUF2 and VPS9a. These results suggest a unique and unprecedented function for a RAB effector involving the integration of two RAB groups to orchestrate endosomal trafficking in plant cells.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x</originId><engagement>18</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f0932f5:133cc3:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy</title><crawled>1525770957557</crawled><published>1525762800000</published><fingerprint>57a2747f</fingerprint><author><name>Vedat Karakas</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25392-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/B_O1OmqRJLM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25392-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/B_O1OmqRJLM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/B_O1OmqRJLM/s41598-018-25392-x</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x</href></item></canonical><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25392-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25392_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>448</height></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196896</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196896</originId><updated>1525381200000</updated><engagement>4</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196896</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aec:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Why some women fail to give birth at health facilities: A comparative study between Ethiopia and Nigeria</title><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><fingerprint>84b954f9</fingerprint><author><name>Sanni Yaya</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sanni Yaya, Ghose Bishwajit, Olalekan A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstetric complications and maternal deaths can be prevented through safe delivery process. Facility based delivery significantly reduces maternal mortality by increasing women’s access to skilled personnel attendance. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, most deliveries take place without skilled attendants and outside health facilities. Utilization of facility-based delivery is affected by socio-cultural norms and several other factors including cost, long distance, accessibility and availability of quality services. This study examined country-level variations of the self-reported causes of not choosing to deliver at a health facility.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional data on 37,086 community dwelling women aged between 15–49 years were collected from DHS surveys in Ethiopia (n = 13,053) and Nigeria (n = 24,033). Outcome variables were the self-reported causes of not delivering at health facilities which were regressed against selected sociodemographic and community level determinants. In total eight items complaints were identified for non-use of facility delivery: 1) Cost too much 2) Facility not open, 3) Too far/no transport, 4) don’t trust facility/poor service, 5) No female provider, 6) Husband/family didn’t allow, 7) Not necessary, 8) Not customary. Multivariable regression methods were used for measuring the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In both countries a large proportion of the women mentioned facility delivery as not necessary, 54.9% (52.3–57.9) in Nigeria and 45.4% (42.0–47.5) in Ethiopia. Significant urban-rural variations were observed in the prevalence of the self-reported causes of non-utilisation. Women in the rural areas are more likely to report delivering at health facility as not customary/not necessary and healthy facility too far/no transport. However, urban women were more likely to complain that husband/family did not allow and that the costs were too high.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Women in the rural were more likely to regard facility delivery as unnecessary and complain about transportation and financial difficulties. In order to achieving the maternal mortality related targets, addressing regional disparities in accessing maternal healthcare services should be regarded as a priority of health promotion programs in Nigeria and Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196896</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanni Yaya, Ghose Bishwajit, Olalekan A.

Background &lt;p&gt;MRI is the optimal method for sensitive detection of tumour tissue and pre-operative staging in oral cancer. When jawbone resections are necessary, the current standard of care for oral tumour surgery in our hospital is 3D virtual planning from CT data. 3D printed jawbone cutting guides are designed from the CT data. The tumour margins are difficult to visualise on CT, whereas they are clearly visible on MRI scans. The aim of this study was to change the conventional CT-based workflow by developing a method for 3D MRI-based lower jaw models. The MRI-based visualisation of the tumour aids in planning bone resection margins.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and findings &lt;p&gt;A workflow for MRI-based 3D surgical planning with bone cutting guides was developed using a four-step approach. Key MRI parameters were defined (phase 1), followed by an application of selected Black Bone MRI sequences on healthy volunteers (phase 2). Three Black Bone MRI sequences were chosen for phase 3: standard, fat saturated, and an out of phase sequence. These protocols were validated by applying them on patients (n = 10) and comparison to corresponding CT data. The mean deviation values between the MRI- and the CT-based models were 0.63, 0.59 and 0.80 mm for the three evaluated Black Bone MRI sequences. Phase 4 entailed examination of the clinical value during surgery, using excellently fitting printed bone cutting guides designed from MRI-based lower jaw models, in two patients with oral cancer. The mean deviation of the resection planes was 2.3 mm, 3.8 mm for the fibula segments, and the mean axis deviation was the fibula segments of 1.9°.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study offers a method for 3D virtual resection planning and surgery using cutting guides based solely on MRI imaging. Therefore, no additional CT data are required for 3D virtual planning in oral cancer surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196059</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Astrid M.

Prevalent anuric peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients usually have higher mortality than PD patients with residual urine volume. We aimed to evaluate the predictors of survival in anuric PD patients. Anuric PD patients (n = 505, &amp;lt;100 mL of daily urine) enrolled in Korean nationwide prospective cohort were analyzed. Survived and non-survived anuric PD patients were compared by propensity score matching analysis with a ratio of two to one. The propensity method was used to adjust for patient age, dialysis duration, and presence of diabetes. Among the total anuric PD patients, non-survived patients showed a significantly older age, higher incidence of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmia, and lower serum creatinine and albumin. After propensity score matching, multivariate Cox regression analysis for patient survival showed a decreasing risk as serum albumin increased (HR = 0.347, p = 0.0094). Analysis using the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve showed that survival could be predicted with a sensitivity of 59.4% and a specificity of 63.2% using a cutoff value of 3.6 g/dL of serum albumin in unmatched total PD patients. The beneficial impact of high albumin level on death was significantly greater for patients with older age (≥50 years), no diabetes, low ultrafiltration (UF) volume (&amp;lt;1000 mL/day), and low levels of serum creatinine (&amp;lt;10 mg/dL), total cholesterol (&amp;lt;177.5 mg/dL), ferritin (&amp;lt;100 ng/mL), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (&amp;lt;0.1 mg/dL). Survival in anuric PD patients was associated with age, comorbidities, and nutritional factors such as creatinine and albumin. After adjustment by propensity score matching, serum albumin level was an independent predictor for survival in anuric PD patients.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196294</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ja-Yong Park, Jang-Hee Cho, Hye Min Jang, Yon Su Kim, Shin-Wook Kang, Chul Woo Yang, Nam-Ho Kim, Ji-Young Choi, Sun-Hee Park, Chan-Duck Kim, Yong-Lim Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major mediator of peritoneal fibrosis and reportedly affects expression of the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9. SET7/9-induced H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) critically activates transcription of fibrosis-related genes. In this study, we examined the effect of SET7/9 inhibition on peritoneal fibrosis in mice and in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). We also examined SET7/9 expression in nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Murine peritoneal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) into male C57/BL6 mice over 21 days. Sinefungin, a SET7/9 inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously just before MGO injection (10 mg/kg). SET7/9 expression was elevated in both MGO-injected mice and nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of PD patients. SET7/9 expression was positively correlated with dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine in PD patients. Sinefungin was shown immunohistochemically to suppress expression of mesenchymal cells and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased H3K4me1 levels. Peritoneal equilibration tests showed that sinefungin attenuated the urea nitrogen transport rate from plasma and the glucose absorption rate from the dialysate. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, sinefungin suppressed TGF-β1-induced expression of fibrotic markers and inhibited H3K4me1. These findings suggest that inhibiting the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196844</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Tamura, Shigehiro Doi, Ayumu Nakashima, Kensuke Sasaki, Kazuya Maeda, Toshinori Ueno, Takao Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

Results were available within 2 hours and women with STIs were immediately treated and offered EPT packs, including medication, condoms, and information for sexual partners. An EPT questionnaire was administered after one week, and women retested for STIs after 6 and 12 weeks. 267 women, median age 23 (IQR 21–26), were recruited and 88.4% (236/267) reported genital symptoms. STI prevalence was CT 18.4% (95%CI 13.7–23.0), NG 5.2% (95%CI 2.6–7.9) and TV 3.0% (95%CI 1.0–5.0). After 12 weeks, all but one NG and two CT infections were cleared. No cephalosporin-resistant NG was detected. Of 63/267 women (23.6%) diagnosed with STIs, 98.4% (62/63) were offered and 87.1% (54/62) accepted EPT. At one week 88.9% (48/54) stated that their partner had taken the medication. No allergic reactions or social harms were reported.

While solubility can be determined by considering the cohesive forces in a liquid via Hansen solubility parameters (HSP), the prediction is often done using Quantitative structure-property relationship models due to its low computational cost. Herein, we report an interpretable and versatile probabilistic approach (gpHSP) to determining HSP.

While solubility can be determined by considering the cohesive forces in a liquid via Hansen solubility parameters (HSP), the prediction is often done using Quantitative structure-property relationship models due to its low computational cost. Herein, we report an interpretable and versatile probabilistic approach (gpHSP) to determining HSP.

The thalamus, a crucial regulator of cortical functions, is composed of many nuclei arranged in a spatially complex pattern. Thalamic neurogenesis occurs over a short period during mammalian embryonic development. These features have hampered the effort to understand how regionalization, cell divisions, and fate specification are coordinated and produce a wide array of nuclei that exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression and functions. Here, we performed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; clonal analysis to track the divisions of individual progenitor cells and spatial allocation of their progeny in the developing mouse thalamus. Quantitative analysis of clone compositions revealed evidence for sequential generation of distinct sets of thalamic nuclei based on the location of the founder progenitor cells. Furthermore, we identified intermediate progenitor cells that produced neurons populating more than one thalamic nuclei, indicating a prolonged specification of nuclear fate. Our study reveals an organizational principle that governs the spatial and temporal progression of cell divisions and fate specification and provides a framework for studying cellular heterogeneity and connectivity in the mammalian thalamus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bh5Rbs1VtLg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Z.

Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion.

Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance.

Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with multiple myeloma included in prospective clinical trials are highly selected and therefore are expected not to be representative of the entire patient population. Additionally recommendations based on literature data and randomized trials are not systematically implemented in all patients. We sought to determine how patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma are currently treated in France.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We performed a nation-wide search using the Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d’Information (PMSI) database which includes anonymous data for all patients hospitalized in France. We identified newly diagnosed cases in 2012 and analyzed the number and duration of hospital stays, coexisting conditions and treatment modalities with data available until the end of 2015. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma was determined for the first time during a hospitalization in France in 2012 in 6,282 patients (3,234 males and 3,048 females). The median age at diagnosis was 74 years (72 in males and 76 in females). A majority (55.3%) of patients were diagnosed and treated in a single heath center, including 37% in a university hospital and 52% in a non-university public hospital. Comorbidities potentially impacting on myeloma treatment were present in 57.5% of patients at diagnosis, and 15% had an associated diagnosis of another neoplasia. Intensive therapies with stem cell transplants were performed in 1033 patients (16% of total), the majority of which were aged less than 65 (881 patients, 85.3%). Stem cell transplants were performed more frequently in males while the distance between the site of residence and the transplant center had no impact on likelihood of receiving a transplant. Only 60% of patients less than 65 years old who were treated for their disease underwent intensification with stem cell transplant within the 4-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A large majority of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma are elderly, in particular females, and not eligible for transplants. Among the patients aged less than 65 and receiving therapy for their disease, 40% do not undergo transplants. These data emphasize the need for alternative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196596</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charles Dumontet, Sandrine Couray-Targe, Marion Teisseire, Lionel Karlin, Delphine Maucort-Boulch&lt;/p&gt;

The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein Merlin functions as a negative regulator of cell growth and actin dynamics in different cell types amongst which Schwann cells have been extensively studied. In contrast, the presence and the role of Merlin in oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells within the CNS, have not been elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that Merlin immunoreactivity was broadly distributed in the white matter throughout the central nervous system. Following Merlin expression during development in the cerebellum, Merlin could be detected in the cerebellar white matter tract at early postnatal stages as shown by its co-localization with Olig2-positive cells as well as in adult brain sections where it was aligned with myelin basic protein containing fibers. This suggests that Merlin is expressed in immature and mature oligodendrocytes. Expression levels of Merlin were low in oligodendrocytes as compared to astrocytes and neurons throughout development. Expression of Merlin in oligodendroglia was further supported by its identification in either immortalized cell lines of oligodendroglial origin or in primary oligodendrocyte cultures. In these cultures, the two main splice variants of &lt;i&gt;Nf2&lt;/i&gt; could be detected. Merlin was localized in clusters within the nuclei and in the cytoplasm. Overexpressing Merlin in oligodendrocyte cell lines strengthened reduced impedance in XCELLigence measurements and Ki67 stainings in cultures over time. In addition, the initiation and elongation of cellular projections were reduced by Merlin overexpression. Consistently, cell migration was retarded in scratch assays done on &lt;i&gt;Nf2&lt;/i&gt;-transfected oligodendrocyte cell lines. These data suggest that Merlin actively modulates process outgrowth and migration in oligodendrocytes.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196726</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Toledo, Elena Grieger, Khalad Karram, Helen Morrison, Stephan L.

These data suggest that Merlin actively modulates process outgrowth and migration in oligodendrocytes.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021359?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021359?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d0e:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><title>Density functional tight-binding and infrequent metadynamics can capture entropic effects in intramolecular hydrogen transfer reactions</title><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><published>1523850004000</published><fingerprint>51ff229</fingerprint><author><name>Luiz F.

Currently approved monoamine modulating antidepressant and anxiolytic pharmaceutics fail in over one third of patients due to delayed and variable therapeutic effect, adverse reactions preceding the therapeutic action, and adherence issues. Even with adequate adherence to the regimen and tolerability, one third of the patients do not respond to any class of antidepressants. There is a strong correlation between treatment resistant depression and increase in inflammatory cytokines in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with pain and inflammation. While a link between pain, inflammation and depression has been suggested it remains unclear which anti-inflammatory treatment may be beneficial to patients with depression and anxiety due to pain. Here, we analyzed 430,783 FDA adverse effect reports of patients treated for pain to identify potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of various anti-inflammatory medications. Patients treated for depression or patients taking any known antidepressants were excluded. The odds ratio analysis of 139,072 NSAID reports revealed that ketoprofen was associated with decreased reports of depression by a factor of 2.32 (OR 0.43 and 95% Confidence Interval [0.31, 0.59]) and decreased reports of anxiety by a factor of 2.86 (OR 0.35 [0.22, 0.56]), diclofenac with decreased depression reports by a factor of 2.22 (OR 0.45 [0.40, 0.49]) and anxiety by a factor of 2.13 (OR 0.47 [0.41, 0.54]), while naproxen decreased depression reports by a factor of 1.92 (OR 0.52 [0.49, 0.57]) and anxiety by a factor of 1.23 (OR 0.81 [0.75, 0.88]). Other NSAIDs did not exhibit any noticeable antidepressant and/or anxiolytic effect.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195521</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tigran Makunts, Isaac V.

Currently approved monoamine modulating antidepressant and anxiolytic pharmaceutics fail in over one third of patients due to delayed and variable therapeutic effect, adverse reactions preceding the therapeutic action, and adherence issues. Even with adequate adherence to the regimen and tolerability, one third of the patients do not respond to any class of antidepressants. There is a strong correlation between treatment resistant depression and increase in inflammatory cytokines in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with pain and inflammation. While a link between pain, inflammation and depression has been suggested it remains unclear which anti-inflammatory treatment may be beneficial to patients with depression and anxiety due to pain.

The best predictor of IA was AspICU algorithm (AUC, 1) followed by serum galactomannan antigen (GM) cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.822). For 37% of patients, IA diagnoses was made earlier with serum GM than radiology.

We previously introduced an approach for EVD prognosis prediction, using models that can be implemented in the field and updated in light of new data. Here we enhance and validate our methods with the largest published EVD dataset to date. We also present a proof-of-concept medical app that summarizes patient information and offers tailored treatment options using an interactive risk visualization for quick interpretation and decision-making. Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. The app is freely available under the name of Ebola RISK on Google Play and Apple&apos;s App Store. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations. These models and derived tools may better inform treatment choices in future EVD outbreaks.

Schmallenberg virus (SBV), initially identified in Germany in 2011, spread rapidly throughout Europe causing significant economic losses in ruminant livestock. The ability to correctly detect emerging and re-emerging diseases such as SBV with reliable tests is of high importance. Firstly, we tested diagnostic performance, specificity, and sensitivity of three different assays used in SBV antibody detection using control sheep samples of determined status. After obtaining the results from the control samples, we assessed the potential of the assays to detect previously infected animals in field situations. The samples were investigated using IDEXX Schmallenberg virus Antibody Test Kit, ID Screen Schmallenberg virus Competition Multi-species ELISA and Serum Neutralisation Test (SNT). Analysis of control samples revealed that SNT was the most suitable test, which was therefore used to calculate concordance and test performance for the two other ELISA tests. To evaluate whether different assay performances had an impact under field conditions, sheep samples from two different contexts were tested: the emergence of SBV in Ireland and the re-emergence of SBV in Belgium. Comparing the results obtained from different assays to the non-reference standard assay SNT, we showed considerable differences in estimates of their sensitivity to detect SBV antibodies and to measure seroprevalence of the sheep flocks. Finally, a calculation of the number of randomly selected animals that needs to be screened from a finite flock, showed that SNT and ID.Vet are the most suitable to detect an introduction of the disease in low seroprevalence situations. The IDEXX ELISA test was only able to detect SBV antibodies in a higher seroprevalence context, which is not optimal for monitoring freedom of disease and surveillance studies.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196532</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Srđan Pejaković, Laëtitia Wiggers, Damien Coupeau, Nathalie Kirschvink, James Mason, Benoît Muylkens&lt;/p&gt;

The IDEXX ELISA test was only able to detect SBV antibodies in a higher seroprevalence context, which is not optimal for monitoring freedom of disease and surveillance studies.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25931-6</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25931-6</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1635df0c4bc:2e3644a:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>A paradox of epidemics between the state and parameter spaces</title><crawled>1526289450172</crawled><published>1526281200000</published><fingerprint>e520f7e2</fingerprint><author><name>Hengcong Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A paradox of epidemics between the state and parameter spaces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paradox of epidemics between the state and parameter spaces, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25931-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25931-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A paradox of epidemics between the state and parameter spaces&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/mbAwJhvlT1k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A paradox of epidemics between the state and parameter spaces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paradox of epidemics between the state and parameter spaces, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25931-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25931-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A paradox of epidemics between the state and parameter spaces&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/mbAwJhvlT1k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/mbAwJhvlT1k/s41598-018-25931-6</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25931-6</href></item></canonical><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25931-6/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25931_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>612</height></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4417</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4417.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4417.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162f8a5b82f:6a632a9:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Spontaneous oscillation and fluid-structure interaction of cilia [Biophysics and Computational Biology]</title><crawled>1524590032943</crawled><published>1524585994000</published><fingerprint>e230766b</fingerprint><author><name>Jihun Han, Charles S.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of acupuncture, sham acupuncture and drugs in the treatment of chronic constipation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of acupuncture and drugs for chronic constipation were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases (such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and CBM) up to December 2017. Additional references were obtained from review articles. With quality evaluations and data extraction, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using a random-effects model under a frequentist framework. A total of 40 studies (n = 11032) were included: 39 were high-quality studies and 1 was a low-quality study. NMA showed that (1) acupuncture improved the symptoms of chronic constipation more effectively than drugs; (2) the ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome was acupuncture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, sham acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo; (3) the ranking of side effects were as follows: lactulose, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, prucalopride, linaclotide, placebo and tegaserod; and (4) the most commonly used acupuncture point for chronic constipation was ST25. Acupuncture is more effective than drugs in improving chronic constipation and has the least side effects. In the future, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to prove this. Sham acupuncture may have curative effects that are greater than the placebo effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform high-quality studies to support this finding. Polyethylene glycol also has acceptable curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196128</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lingping Zhu, Yunhui Ma, Xiaoyan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), is a transcription factor that governs pathways, such as lipid metabolism and immune response, that have been implicated in the etiology of LOAD. Previously, we established HepG2-derived cell-lines with stable knockdown of PPARγ gene, and showed an increase in mRNA levels of genes mapped in the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; linkage disequilibrium (LD) region on chromosome 19q13.32, with the greatest effect observed for &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-mRNA. Here, we extended the analysis using our &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown model system and investigated the broader effect on expression changes of genes implicated in LOAD via genome wide association studies (GWAS). We applied the nCounter gene expression assay (NanoString) using a panel of twenty-four LOAD-associated genes inferred by proximity to the top significantly associated SNPs. Two independent &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown cell-lines showed changes in mRNA levels of a total of seven genes compared to a control HepG2 cell-line; six of which, &lt;i&gt;ABCA7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CASS4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CELF1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PTK2B&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ZCWPW1&lt;/i&gt;, were upregulated and one, &lt;i&gt;DSG2&lt;/i&gt;, was downregulated upon &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. Our results propose that &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; may act as a master regulator of the transcription of several genes involved in LOAD pathogenesis.

Altogether, our studies suggest that the multi-chambered atrium in amniotes arose from a molecular blueprint present before the evolutionary emergence of cardiac septation and provide insights into the establishment of atrial asymmetry.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>16.38</engagementRate></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6</link><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_162dd386e29:40991ef:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId><title>Nature Neuroscience</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain</title><crawled>1524129885737</crawled><published>1524121200000</published><fingerprint>7d06a78e</fingerprint><author><name>Jing Huang</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0149-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0149-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E3932</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E3932.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E3932.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162f8a5b82f:6a632ba:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Crystal structure and mechanism of human carboxypeptidase O: Insights into its specific activity for acidic residues [Biochemistry]</title><crawled>1524590032943</crawled><published>1524585994000</published><fingerprint>fec87df</fingerprint><author><name>Maria C.

Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PKWzqyJ_2Tk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in &lt;i&gt;PIK3CA&lt;/i&gt; genes.

Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites.

Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites. At baseline, less than half the facilities in Johannesburg and Mopani had dedicated eye care personnel or sufficient space to measure visual acuity. Although visual acuity charts were available in most facilities, &amp;lt;50% assessed patients at the correct distance. Median score for availability of nine essential drugs was &amp;lt;70%. Referral criteria knowledge was highest in Cape Winelands and Johannesburg, with poor clinical knowledge across all districts. Several HSS interventions produced successful outcomes: compared to control sites there was a significant increase in the proportion of intervention sites with eye care personnel and resources such as visual acuity charts (p = 0.02 and &amp;lt;0.01, respectively). However, engaging with district pharmacists did not improve availability of essential drugs (p = 0.47). Referral criteria knowledge improved significantly in intervention sites (p&amp;lt;0.01) but there was no improvement in clinical knowledge (p = 0.76). Primary eye care in South Africa faces multiple challenges with regard to organisation of care, resource availability and clinical competence. The HSS package successfully improved some aspects of this care, but further development is warranted together with debate regarding the positioning of eye services at PHC level.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25219-9</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25219-9</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16318a22675:2181a40:fc1f8953</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Author Correction: Grain Yield, Starch Content and Activities of Key Enzymes of Waxy and Non-waxy Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)</title><crawled>1525126669941</crawled><published>1525158000000</published><fingerprint>3fee2af</fingerprint><author><name>Yan Zi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Grain Yield, Starch Content and Activities of Key Enzymes of Waxy and Non-waxy Wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt;

Individuals often respond differently to the same vaccine; some of this variation may be caused by genetic differences among animals. Our objective was to estimate heritability and identify genomic regions associated with humoral response to an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine in beef cattle. Crossbred beef cattle (n = 651) were vaccinated with a commercially available &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine. Serum was collected at time of initial vaccination (d 0), booster (d 21), and d 56 after initial vaccination. Total antibodies specific to siderophore receptor and porin proteins in the vaccine were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood and genotyped with the bovine GeneSeek Genomic Profiler-High Density 78K or 26K Single Nucleotide Polymorphism BeadChip and imputed to 777,000 SNP genotypes. Heritability was estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using both 1) pedigree and 2) genomic relationships among individuals. Fixed effects were contemporary group, calf age, sex, principal components from SNP genotype data, and pedigree-derived heterozygosity effects. Additive and dominance effects of SNPs were estimated individually while accounting for contemporary group, sex, and the top 20 principal components calculated from the genomic relationship matrix. Heritability of initial response to vaccination (d 21 –d 0) was 0.10 ± 0.175 using pedigree relationships and 0.14 ± 0.149 using genomic relationships, but neither estimate was statistically different from zero. Heritability of booster (d 56 –d 21) and overall (d 56 –d 0) responses were low and not statistically significant from zero. There were no clusters of linked SNP associated with vaccine response, but eight regionally isolated SNPs were significantly associated with initial or overall response to vaccination. Regional genetic variation for initial response to an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine was observed, although overall heritability of this response was not statistically significant from zero.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197347</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kara B.

To make our model easily accessible for standalone use and integration in third-party software, we&apos;ve developed a Python package with a minimalistic user interface.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3808</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3808.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3808.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162d525c55d:348c31b:34f43e70</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Multiple nuclear-replicating viruses require the stress-induced protein ZC3H11A for efficient growth [Microbiology]</title><crawled>1523994445149</crawled><published>1523990209000</published><fingerprint>4dd8ad5b</fingerprint><author><name>Shady Younis, Wael Kamel, Tina Falkeborn, Hao Wang, Di Yu, Robert Daniels, Magnus Essand, Jorma Hinkula, Goran Akusȷarvi, Leif Andersson</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The zinc finger CCCH-type containing 11A (ZC3H11A) gene encodes a well-conserved zinc finger protein that may function in mRNA export as it has been shown to associate with the transcription export (TREX) complex in proteomic screens.

Safe and efficacious orally-delivered mucosal vaccine platforms are desperately needed to combat the plethora of mucosally transmitted pathogens. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. have emerged as attractive candidates to meet this need and are known to activate the host innate immune response in a species- and strain-specific manner. For selected bacterial isolates and mutants, we investigated the role of key innate immune pathways required for induction of innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Co-culture of murine macrophages with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gasseri&lt;/i&gt; (strain NCK1785), &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; (strain NCFM), or NCFM-derived mutants—NCK2025 and NCK2031—elicited an M2b-like phenotype associated with TH2 skewing and immune regulatory function. For NCFM, this M2b phenotype was dependent on expression of lipoteichoic acid and S layer proteins. Through the use of macrophage genetic knockouts, we identified Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) receptor, and the inflammasome-associated caspase-1 as contributors to macrophage activation, with NOD2 cooperating with caspase-1 to induce inflammasome derived interleukin (IL)-1β in a pyroptosis-independent fashion. Finally, utilizing an NCFM-based mucosal vaccine platform with surface expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag or membrane proximal external region (MPER), we demonstrated that NOD2 signaling is required for antigen-specific mucosal and systemic humoral responses. We show that lactobacilli differentially utilize innate immune pathways and highlight NOD2 as a key mediator of macrophage function and antigen-specific humoral responses to a &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; mucosal vaccine platform.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196950</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara A.

We show experimentally that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the atomic cloud. We used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00177</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00177</link><id>nWAmhAfvfdY6zhQafSMhdWASYooG1IX3uplCe3rnLYA=_162cf51da77:e58387:bdf8aaf1</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>[ASAP] Accurate and Efficient Parallel Implementation of an Effective Linear-Scaling Direct Random Phase Approximation Method</title><crawled>1523896670839</crawled><published>1523851200000</published><fingerprint>fe6d2d27</fingerprint><author><name>Daniel Graf, Matthias Beuerle, Henry F.

&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a protozoon parasite that causes congenital toxoplasmosis, as well as other serious clinical presentations, in immune compromised humans. Analyses of the prevalence and genotyping of strains from the definitive host and intermediate hosts will help to understanding the circulation of the different strains and elucidating the role of the genotype(s) in human toxoplasmosis. Turkey has a specific geographic location bridging Africa, Europe, and Asia. We hypothesized that &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains may have been transferred to Turkey from these continents via migratory birds or vice versa. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in wild birds of prey of İzmir and Manisa provinces as well as genetically characterize &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; strains from these wild birds to show the relation between bird strains and neighboring stray cats as well as human strains previously isolated in Turkey. Tissues obtained from 48 wild birds were investigated for the presence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA and then bioassayed in mouse. Isolated strains were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers. The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt; DNA was found to be 89.6% (n: 43/48) in wild birds. Out of 43 positive samples, a total of 14 strains were genotyped by 15 microsatellite markers.

The transfer of seaweeds from subtidal bottoms to nearby intertidal rocky shores is a common but often overlooked phenomenon. Freshly detached seaweeds often represent critical trophic subsidies for herbivores living in upper-shore rocky intertidal areas, such as the marine snail &lt;i&gt;Diloma nigerrima&lt;/i&gt;. This species relies on three species of seaweeds for food and displays feeding strategies to deal with a resource that is scarce and at times unpredictable. This study focused on the nutritional quality of freshly detached algae (&lt;i&gt;Durvillaea antarctica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lessonia spicata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lessonia trabeculata&lt;/i&gt;) and measured &lt;i&gt;Diloma nigerrima&lt;/i&gt;’s algal consumption rates in trials with and without choice. Absorption efficiency and growth of individual snails fed on each alga were also measured. &lt;i&gt;Durvillaea antarctica&lt;/i&gt; had the highest nutritional quality and was the most consumed algae in both single and multiple-choice trials. Absorption efficiency was also highest for &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;antarctica&lt;/i&gt; but growth rates of snails fed with this species were similar to those fed with the other algae. Combined, these results suggest that &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigerrima&lt;/i&gt; has the ability to discriminate among seaweeds based on their nutritional quality. A potential increase in oxygen uptake when &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigerrima&lt;/i&gt; is consuming the preferred food item is also proposed as a plausible hypothesis to explain the mismatch between snails’ preference and growth rate.

Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196973</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chompunut Lumsangkul, Yang-Kwang Fan, Shen-Chang Chang, Jyh-Cherng Ju, Hsin-I.

Extensive research revealed tremendous details about how plants sense pathogen effectors during effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, less is known about downstream signaling events. In this report, we demonstrate that prolonged activation of MPK3 and MPK6, two &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; pathogen-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), is essential to ETI mediated by both coiled coil-nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (CNLs) and toll/interleukin-1 receptor nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (TNLs) types of R proteins. MPK3/MPK6 activation rapidly alters the expression of photosynthesis-related genes and inhibits photosynthesis, which promotes the accumulation of superoxide (O2•−) and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), two major reactive oxygen species (ROS), in chloroplasts under light. In the chemical-genetically rescued &lt;i&gt;mpk3 mpk6&lt;/i&gt; double mutants, ETI-induced photosynthetic inhibition and chloroplastic ROS accumulation are compromised, which correlates with delayed hypersensitive response (HR) cell death and compromised resistance. Furthermore, protection of chloroplasts by expressing a plastid-targeted cyanobacterial flavodoxin (pFLD) delays photosynthetic inhibition and compromises ETI. Collectively, this study highlights a critical role of MPK3/MPK6 in manipulating plant photosynthetic activities to promote ROS accumulation in chloroplasts and HR cell death, which contributes to the robustness of ETI. Furthermore, the dual functionality of MPK3/MPK6 cascade in promoting defense and inhibiting photosynthesis potentially allow it to orchestrate the trade-off between plant growth and defense in plant immunity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/feggFvBsPmE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jianbin Su, Liuyi Yang, Qiankun Zhu, Hongjiao Wu, Yi He, Yidong Liu, Juan Xu, Dean Jiang, Shuqun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are biomarkers for several neoplastic diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The individual miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir192 or the triplex miRNA panel showed high diagnostic accuracy for HCC (HCC vs. CHB, AUC = 0.906; HCC vs. CHB+LC, AUC = 0.81; HCC vs. CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.854). When AFP levels were ≤20ng/ml, the triplex miRNA panel still was accurate in distinguishing HCC from the other conditions (CHB, AUC = 0.922; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.836; CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.862).

Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) to prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain. Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities. It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood. Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95). We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users. LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011 and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019 respectively). 20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.040) but not women. Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE. These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196398</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica A.

These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/14/322370</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322370v1?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322370v1?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163609f2279:326ef7c:3dd877af</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>DeepEM: Deep 3D ConvNets With EM For Weakly Supervised Pulmonary Nodule Detection [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1526334431865</crawled><published>1526281200000</published><fingerprint>139e22a8</fingerprint><author><name>Zhu, W.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Recently deep learning has been witnessing widespread adoption in various medical image applications.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of infection and poorer responses to vaccination. This suggests that CKD patients have an impaired responsiveness to all antigens, even those first encountered before CKD onset. To examine this we evaluated antibody responses against two childhood vaccine antigens, tetanus (TT) and diphtheria toxoids (DT) and two common pathogens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Enteritidis (SEn) in two independent cohorts consisting of age-matched individuals with and without CKD. Sera were evaluated for antigen-specific IgG titres and the functionality of antibody to SEn was assessed in a serum bactericidal assay. Surprisingly, patients with CKD and control subjects had comparable levels of IgG against TT and DT, suggesting preserved humoral memory responses to antigens encountered early in life. Lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG titres and serum bactericidal activity in patients with CKD were also not inferior to controls. CMV-specific IgG titres in seropositive CKD patients were similar or even increased compared to controls. Therefore, whilst responses to new vaccines in CKD are typically lower than expected, antibody responses to antigens commonly encountered prior to CKD onset are not. The immunodeficiency of CKD is likely characterised by failure to respond to new antigenic challenges and efforts to improve patient outcomes should be focussed here.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadezhda A.

Age is a major risk factor for diseases caused by ischemic hypoxia, such as stroke and coronary artery disease. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are the major cells respond to ischemic hypoxia through angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. However, the effect of aging on EPCs and their responses to hypoxia are not well understood. CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs were isolated from healthy volunteers and aged by replicative senescence, which was to passage cells until their doubling time was twice as long as the original cells. Young and aged CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs were exposed to a hypoxic environment (1% oxygen for 48hrs) and their gene expression profiles were evaluated using gene expression array. Gene array results were confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and BALB/c female athymic nude mice hindlimb ischemia model. We identified 115 differentially expressed genes in young CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs, 54 differentially expressed genes in aged CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs, and 25 common genes between normoxia and hypoxia groups. Among them, the expression of solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1 (SLC2A1) increased the most by hypoxia in young cells. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated the pathways affected by aging and hypoxia most, including genes “response to oxygen levels” in young EPCs and genes involved “chondroitin sulfate metabolic process” in aged cells. Our study results indicate the key factors that contribute to the effects of aging on response to hypoxia in CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs. With the potential applications of EPCs in cardiovascular and other diseases, our study also provides insight on the impact of ex vivo expansion might have on EPCs.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196572</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tzu-Wei Wu, Chun-Chieh Liu, Chung-Lieh Hung, Chih-Hsien Yen, Yih-Jer Wu, Li-Yu Wang, Hung-I Yeh&lt;/p&gt;

This paper presents the design and fabrication of a multi-layer and multi-chamber microchip system using thiol-ene ‘click chemistry’ aimed for drug transport studies across tissue barrier models. The fabrication process enables rapid prototyping of multi-layer microfluidic chips using different thiol-ene polymer mixtures, where porous Teflon membranes for cell monolayer growth were incorporated by masked sandwiching thiol-ene-based fluid layers. Electrodes for trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were incorporated using low-melting soldering wires in combination with platinum wires, enabling parallel real-time monitoring of barrier integrity for the eight chambers. Additionally, the translucent porous Teflon membrane enabled optical monitoring of cell monolayers. The device was developed and tested with the Caco-2 intestinal model, and compared to the conventional Transwell system. Cell monolayer differentiation was assessed via &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; immunocytochemistry of tight junction and mucus proteins, P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) mediated efflux of Rhodamine 123, and brush border aminopeptidase activity. Monolayer tightness and relevance for drug delivery research was evaluated through permeability studies of mannitol, dextran and insulin, alone or in combination with the absorption enhancer tetradecylmaltoside (TDM). The thiol-ene-based microchip material and electrodes were highly compatible with cell growth. In fact, Caco-2 cells cultured in the device displayed differentiation, mucus production, directional transport and aminopeptidase activity within 9–10 days of cell culture, indicating robust barrier formation at a faster rate than in conventional Transwell models. The cell monolayer displayed high TEER and tightness towards hydrophilic compounds, whereas co-administration of an absorption enhancer elicited TEER-decrease and increased permeability similar to the Transwell cultures. The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197101</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hsih-Yin Tan, Sofie Trier, Ulrik L.

The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04900-z</originId><engagement>6</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04900-z</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162fcb612bb:37fdc6:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Cap drug prices with policy – here’s how</title><crawled>1524658213563</crawled><published>1524639600000</published><fingerprint>dccfba85</fingerprint><author><name>Leah Cairns</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cap drug prices with policy – here’s how&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cap drug prices with policy – here’s how, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04900-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04900-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cap drug prices with policy – here’s how</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04900-z</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cap drug prices with policy – here’s how&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cap drug prices with policy – here’s how, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04900-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04900-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cap drug prices with policy – here’s how</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00109</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00109</link><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_163649820d2:13aa30:d63e3ae2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>[ASAP] Targeting Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) Channel Softly: The Discovery of Passerini Adducts as a Topical Treatment for Inflammatory Skin Disorders</title><crawled>1526401081554</crawled><published>1526356800000</published><fingerprint>6c1e1ab5</fingerprint><author><name>Marta Serafini, Alessia Griglio, Silvio Aprile, Fabio Seiti, Cristina Travelli, Franco Pattarino, Giorgio Grosa, Giovanni Sorba, Armando A.

Burckhardt, Madhura Bhave, Zhiming Chen, Ping-Hung Chen, Xinxin Wang, Gaudenz Danuser, Sandra L. Schmid&lt;/p&gt;
Dynamin Guanosine Triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases) are best studied for their role in the terminal membrane fission process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), but they have also been proposed to regulate earlier stages of CME. Although highly enriched in neurons, dynamin-1 (Dyn1) is, in fact, widely expressed along with Dyn2 but inactivated in non-neuronal cells via phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) kinase. Here, we study the differential, isoform-specific functions of Dyn1 and Dyn2 as regulators of CME. Endogenously expressed Dyn1 and Dyn2 were fluorescently tagged either separately or together in two cell lines with contrasting Dyn1 expression levels. By quantitative live cell dual- and triple-channel total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we find that Dyn2 is more efficiently recruited to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) than Dyn1, and that Dyn2 but not Dyn1 exhibits a pronounced burst of assembly, presumably into supramolecular collar-like structures that drive membrane scission and clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation. Activation of Dyn1 by acute inhibition of GSK3β results in more rapid endocytosis of transferrin receptors, increased rates of CCP initiation, and decreased CCP lifetimes but did not significantly affect the extent of Dyn1 recruitment to CCPs. Thus, activated Dyn1 can regulate early stages of CME that occur well upstream of fission, even when present at low, substoichiometric levels relative to Dyn2. Under physiological conditions, Dyn1 is activated downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to alter CCP dynamics. We identify sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) as a preferred binding partner to activated Dyn1 that is partially required for Dyn1-dependent effects on early stages of CCP maturation. Together, we decouple regulatory and scission functions of dynamins and report a scission-independent, isoform-specific regulatory role for Dyn1 in CME.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k6hPvNlNbzg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Saipraveen Srinivasan, Christoph J.

Trace metal dynamics have not been studied with respect to growth increments in octocorals. It is particularly unknown whether ontogenetic compartmentalization of trace metal accumulation is species-specific. We studied here for the first time the intracolonial distribution and concentrations of 18 trace metals in the octocorals &lt;i&gt;Subergorgia suberosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Echinogorgia complexa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;reticulata&lt;/i&gt; that were retrieved from the northern coast of Taiwan. Levels of trace metals were considerably elevated in corals collected at these particular coral habitats as a result of diverse anthropogenic inputs.

We used for the first time exponential growth curves that describe an age-specific relationship of octocoral trace metal concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb where the distance from the grip point was reflecting younger age as linear regressions. The larger colony (C7) had a lower accumulation rate constant than the smaller one (C6) for Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb, while other trace metals showed an opposite trend.

Phylogeny of hard ticks (Ixodidae) remains unresolved. Mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) are increasingly used to resolve phylogenetic controversies, but remain unavailable for the entire large &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; genus. &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma asiaticum&lt;/i&gt; is a parasitic tick distributed throughout the Asia. As a result of great morphological variability, two subspecies have been recognised historically; until a morphological data-based synonymization was proposed. However, this hypothesis was never tested using molecular data. Therefore, objectives of this study were to: 1. sequence the first &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; mitogenome; 2. scrutinise the proposed synonymization using molecular data, i.e. complete mitogenomes of both subspecies: &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;asiaticum and kozlovi&lt;/i&gt;; 3. conduct phylogenomic and comparative analyses of all available Ixodidae mitogenomes. Results corroborate the proposed synonymization: the two mitogenomes are almost identical (99.6%). Genomic features of both mitogenomes are standard for Metastriata; which includes the presence of two control regions and all three &amp;quot;Tick-Box&amp;quot; motifs. Gene order and strand distribution are perfectly conserved for the entire Metastriata group. Suspecting compositional biases, we conducted phylogenetic analyses (29 almost complete mitogenomes) using homogeneous and heterogeneous (CAT) models of substitution. The results were congruent, apart from the deep-level topology of prostriate ticks (&lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;): the homogeneous model produced a monophyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;, but the CAT model produced a paraphyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt; (and thereby Prostriata), divided into Australasian and non-Australasian clades. This topology implies that all metastriate ticks have evolved from the ancestor of the non-Australian branch of prostriate ticks. Metastriata was divided into three clades: 1. Amblyomminae and Rhipicephalinae (&lt;i&gt;Rhipicephalus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dermacentor&lt;/i&gt;); 2. Haemaphysalinae and Bothriocrotoninae, plus &lt;i&gt;Amblyomma sphenodonti&lt;/i&gt;; 3. &lt;i&gt;Amblyomma elaphense&lt;/i&gt;, basal to all Metastriata.

Phylogeny of hard ticks (Ixodidae) remains unresolved. Mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) are increasingly used to resolve phylogenetic controversies, but remain unavailable for the entire large &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; genus. &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma asiaticum&lt;/i&gt; is a parasitic tick distributed throughout the Asia. As a result of great morphological variability, two subspecies have been recognised historically; until a morphological data-based synonymization was proposed. However, this hypothesis was never tested using molecular data. Therefore, objectives of this study were to: 1. sequence the first &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; mitogenome; 2. scrutinise the proposed synonymization using molecular data, i.e. complete mitogenomes of both subspecies: &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;asiaticum and kozlovi&lt;/i&gt;; 3. conduct phylogenomic and comparative analyses of all available Ixodidae mitogenomes. Results corroborate the proposed synonymization: the two mitogenomes are almost identical (99.6%). Genomic features of both mitogenomes are standard for Metastriata; which includes the presence of two control regions and all three &amp;quot;Tick-Box&amp;quot; motifs. Gene order and strand distribution are perfectly conserved for the entire Metastriata group. Suspecting compositional biases, we conducted phylogenetic analyses (29 almost complete mitogenomes) using homogeneous and heterogeneous (CAT) models of substitution. The results were congruent, apart from the deep-level topology of prostriate ticks (&lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;): the homogeneous model produced a monophyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;, but the CAT model produced a paraphyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt; (and thereby Prostriata), divided into Australasian and non-Australasian clades. This topology implies that all metastriate ticks have evolved from the ancestor of the non-Australian branch of prostriate ticks. Metastriata was divided into three clades: 1.

Bifidobacteria colonize the human gastrointestinal tract, vagina, oral cavity and breast milk. They influence human physiology and nutrition through health-promoting effects, play an important role as primary colonizers of the newborn gut, and contribute to vaginal microbiome homeostasis by producing lactic acid. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which bifidobacteria are transmitted from mother to infant remains in discussion. Moreover, studies have suggested that &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt; spp. have specializations for gut colonization, but comparisons of strains of the same bifidobacteria species from different body sites are lacking. Here, our objective was to compare the genomes of &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium breve&lt;/i&gt; (n = 17) and &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium longum&lt;/i&gt; (n = 26) to assess whether gut and vaginal isolates of either species were distinguishable based on genome content. Comparison of the general genome features showed that vaginal and gut isolates did not differ in size, GC content, number of genes and CRISPR, either for &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;breve&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longum&lt;/i&gt;. Average nucleotide identity and whole genome phylogeny analysis revealed that vaginal and gut isolates did not cluster separately. Vaginal and gut isolates also had a similar COG (Cluster of Orthologous Group) category distribution. Differences in the accessory genomes between vaginal and gut strains were observed, but were not sufficient to distinguish isolates based on their origin. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the vaginal and gut microbiomes are colonized by a shared community of &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, and further emphasize the potential importance of the maternal vaginal microbiome as a source of infant gut microbiota.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196290</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aline C.

The results of this study support the hypothesis that the vaginal and gut microbiomes are colonized by a shared community of &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, and further emphasize the potential importance of the maternal vaginal microbiome as a source of infant gut microbiota.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f0932f5:133cc2:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)</title><crawled>1525770957557</crawled><published>1525762800000</published><fingerprint>6517c35f</fingerprint><author><name>Yi Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a), Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25386-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/FtXjpO7QP_U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a), Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25386-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dual actions of Psalmotoxin at ASIC1a and ASIC2a heteromeric channels (ASIC1a/2a)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/FtXjpO7QP_U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/FtXjpO7QP_U/s41598-018-25386-9</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25386-9</href></item></canonical><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196952</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196952</originId><updated>1525726800000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196952</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42262:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Heterologous expression of ZjOMT from &amp;lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&amp;lt;/i&gt; in &amp;lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; confers aluminum resistance through melatonin production</title><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><published>1525726800000</published><fingerprint>5455013e</fingerprint><author><name>Hongsong Luo</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hongsong Luo, Chunyan He, Liebao Han&lt;/p&gt;
Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. It can alleviate the damage of heavy metal ions, and other chemical substances, changes in temperature and humidity, oxidative stress in higher plants, and enhance resistance of plants to abiotic stress. The transformation of N-Acetyl-5-hydroxy tryptamin into melatonin requires the involvement of methyltransferase. In this study, a methyltransferase gene &lt;i&gt;ZjOMT&lt;/i&gt; has been cloned from &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. The gene was induced by aluminum (Al) stress in the leaves and roots of &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;, and was up-regulated by 20.86- and 31.18-folds, respectively. The expression of ZjOMT in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increased the content of melatonin by about 8-fold in the recombinant strain compared with that of the empty vector strain. Al resistance test showed that the resistance of recombinant strain BL21-pET32-ZjOMT to Al was significantly higher than that of the empty vector strain BL21-pET32. The survival rate of the recombinant strain expressing ZjOMT was about 100-fold higher than that of the empty vector strain when treated with 0.35 mM Al. These findings suggest that the heterologous expression of ZjOMT improved the resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to Al by increasing the content of melatonin.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196952</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongsong Luo, Chunyan He, Liebao Han&lt;/p&gt;

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paul G.

&lt;i&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal mushroom that has been widely used in East Asia for the treatment of various diseases. The pharmacological activity of this fungus is primarily attributable to the polysaccharides and triterpenoids. In this study, to obtain the fruit bodies with improved content of active constituents, we examined the effect of salicylic acid (SA) and calcium ion on the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and triterpenoids by spraying the chemicals during the fruiting. To explore the underlying mechanisms for the variation, the transcripts of related genes involved in the polysaccharide and triterpenoid biosynthesis were measured. Results showed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; had no effect on production of polysaccharides and triterpenoids, whereas SA increased triterpenoid content by 23.32%, compared to the control, but it had little influence on polysaccharide production. Interestingly, the combined induction increased polysaccharide and triterpenoid content by 9.02% and 13.61%, respectively, compared to the control. Under Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induction, the transcript of &lt;i&gt;ugp&lt;/i&gt; gene in the polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway up-regulated in all three stages (mycelium, primordium, and fruit body), while &lt;i&gt;pgm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;gls&lt;/i&gt; gave no response in the mycelium and primordium stages, and up-regulated in the fruit body stage. Differently, six key triterpenoid biosynthetic genes including &lt;i&gt;hmgr&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;hmgs&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mvd&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fps&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sqs&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ls&lt;/i&gt; did not respond to the induction. In the case of SA and combined induction, &lt;i&gt;pgm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ugp&lt;/i&gt; were up-regulated in all three stages, while &lt;i&gt;gls&lt;/i&gt; showed an increased expression in the primordium stage and no response in other stages. The six triterpenoid biosynthetic genes were up-regulated in all three stages.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed for the first time whether urinary free light chains (FLC) are independently associated with risk of ESRD in patients with CKD, and whether they offer incremental value in risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We measured urinary FLCs in 556 patients with CKD from a prospective cohort study. The association between urinary kappa/creatinine (KCR) and lambda/creatinine (LCR) ratios and development of ESRD was assessed by competing-risks regression (to account for the competing risk of death). The change in C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement were used to assess the incremental value of adding KCR or LCR to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;136 participants developed ESRD during a median follow-up time of 51 months. Significant associations between KCR and LCR and risk of ESRD became non-significant after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), although having a KCR or LCR &gt;75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centile remained independently associated with risk of ESRD.

Levels above the 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centile do have an independent association with ESRD, but do not improve upon a current model for risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1635df0c4bc:2e36445:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility</title><crawled>1526289450172</crawled><published>1526281200000</published><fingerprint>6ba7ff89</fingerprint><author><name>Junheng Gao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25899-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RD_9D86bxGY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25899-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Segregation mediated heterogeneous structure in a metastable β titanium alloy with a superior combination of strength and ductility&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RD_9D86bxGY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/RD_9D86bxGY/s41598-018-25899-3</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25899-3</href></item></canonical><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25899-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25899_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>558</height></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</originId><updated>1525726800000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4226b:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Mitochondrial modulation-induced activation of vagal sensory neuronal subsets by antimycin A, but not CCCP or rotenone, correlates with mitochondrial superoxide production</title><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><published>1525726800000</published><fingerprint>b90d5f19</fingerprint><author><name>Katherine R.

Inflammation causes nociceptive sensory neuron activation, evoking debilitating symptoms and reflexes. Inflammatory signaling pathways are capable of modulating mitochondrial function, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization and calcium release. Previously we showed that mitochondrial modulation with antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, selectively stimulated nociceptive bronchopulmonary C-fibers via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1) cation channels. TRPA1 is ROS-sensitive, but there is little evidence that TRPV1 is activated by ROS. Here, we used dual imaging of dissociated vagal neurons to investigate the correlation of mitochondrial superoxide production (mitoSOX) or mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1) with cytosolic calcium (Fura-2AM), following mitochondrial modulation by antimycin A, rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, mitochondrial uncoupling agent). Mitochondrial modulation by all agents selectively increased cytosolic calcium in a subset of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing (A1/V1+) neurons. There was a significant correlation between antimycin A-induced calcium responses and mitochondrial superoxide in wild-type ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons, which was eliminated in TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nevertheless, antimycin A-induced superoxide production did not always increase calcium in A1/V1+ neurons, suggesting a critical role of an unknown factor. CCCP caused both superoxide production and mitochondrial depolarization but neither correlated with calcium fluxes in A1/V1+ neurons. Rotenone-induced calcium responses in ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons correlated with mitochondrial depolarization but not superoxide production. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction causes calcium fluxes in a subset of A1/V1+ neurons via ROS-dependent and ROS-independent mechanisms.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine R.

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197048</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197370</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197370</originId><updated>1526418000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197370</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b85:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Immunity levels to poliovirus in Lao children and adults before the vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak: A retrospective study</title><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><published>1526418000000</published><fingerprint>1e68b1d1</fingerprint><author><name>Maude Pauly</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maude Pauly, Antony P.

In 2015, several provinces in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) experienced a vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak. This survey was conducted (i) to evaluate the vaccination coverage in different settings and cohorts using the seroprevalence of anti-poliovirus (PV) antibodies as a surrogate measure, and (ii) to explore the usefulness of an ELISA in a country with limited resources and a specific epidemiological setting. IgG antibodies were assessed by ELISA in Lao children (n = 1216) and adults (n = 1228), including blood donors and health care workers. Protective antibody titers against the 3 vaccine serotypes were determined by microneutralization (VNT) in a subset of participants. More than 92% of the children had anti-poliovirus antibodies, regardless of nutritional status or access to health care, highlighting the success of the vaccination outreach activities in the country. In contrast, anti-poliovirus seroprevalence reached only 81.7% in blood donors and 71.9% in health care workers. Participants born before the introduction of poliovirus vaccination in Lao PDR were considerably less likely to be seropositive. These findings align with the epidemiology of the outbreak. Neutralizing antibodies against at least one of the 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected in all children (99/99) and 93/99 had antibodies against all serotypes. Similarly, all health care workers had neutralizing antibodies against at least one and 92/99 against all serotypes. The comparison of both assays shows an acceptable underestimation of vaccine coverage in children by ELISA, but a low sensitivity of the ELISA in the adults. We show that the ELISA is a reasonable alternative to the VNT in particular in vaccinated children, that an improved version should be serotype specific, and that negativity thresholds should be revisited for optimal sensitivity and specificity. Thus, polio-free countries with an uncertain vaccination coverage and limited laboratory capacity, that are at risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks or of re-importation of wild poliovirus may benefit from an improved ELISA for cohort studies to evaluate their immunization program in children.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197370</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maude Pauly, Antony P.

The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been decreasing globally, but the growing effects of HCV-related morbidity and mortality remain of concern. Advances in curative medicine, involving direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), have led many countries to aim to eradicate HCV. Information on epidemiology and disease burden is essential for national policy development. Thus, this study aimed to determine the HCV-related hepatic disease burden in areas of Thailand with high and average HCV prevalence in order to extrapolate the viral burden across Thailand. Patients previously diagnosed as positive for anti-HCV antibodies were recruited to assess chronic HCV infection (CHC) status, liver function, HCV-RNA level and hepatic fibrosis. The number of patients eligible for Universal Health Coverage (UC) scheme and the approximately required expenditure on interferon (IFN)-based treatment were estimated. In areas of both high (12%) and average (2%) HCV viremic prevalence, over half of the patients (52.2% to 62.5%) had advanced liver fibrosis (F3 and F4). A striking percentage of patients with F4 (38.9%) were found in the high-prevalence area, while comparable proportions of advanced liver fibrosis presented in the two areas and disease burden peaked at 50–59 years. Under the current UC program treatment scenario, 78–83% of CHC patients with stage F2–F4 fibrosis were eligible for treatment. The estimated expenditure required for overall CHC treatment across the whole country was 1,240 million USD at this current status, but the declining cost of generic DAA-based therapy may reduce the requirement to &amp;lt;90 million USD. This study provides information on the estimated number of CHC patients, liver disease burden and expenditure requirements for Thailand. To eliminate HCV by 2030, proactive government strategies raising public health to minimize transmission and emphasizing targeted screen-and-treatment programs, novel therapeutic guideline development for decentralizing treatment, and effective budget allocation are urgently needed.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196301</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rujipat Wasitthankasem, Preeyaporn Vichaiwattana, Nipaporn Siripon, Nawarat Posuwan, Chompoonut Auphimai, Sirapa Klinfueng, Napha Thanetkongtong, Viboonsak Vuthitanachot, Supapith Saiyatha, Chaiwat Thongmai, Saowakon Sochoo, Natnada Pongsuwan, Kittiyod Poovorawan, Pisit Tangkijvanich, Yong Poovorawan&lt;/p&gt;

Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds with variable phenolic structures, have been found to possess anti-cancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors like CDK6. To understand the binding behavior of flavonoids that inhibit the active CDK6, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on six inhibitors, chrysin (M01), fisetin (M03), galangin (M04), genistein (M05), quercetin (M06) and kaempferol (M07), complexed with CDK6/cyclin D. For all six flavonoids, the 3’-OH and 4’-OH of B-ring were found to be favorable for hydrogen bond formation, but the 3-OH on the C-ring and 5-OH on the A-ring were unfavorable, which were confirmed by the MD simulation results of the test molecule, 3’, 4’, 7-trihydroxyflavone (M15). The binding efficiencies of flavonoids against the CDK6/cyclin D complex were mainly through the electrostatic (especially the H-bond force) and vdW interactions with residues ILE19, VAL27, ALA41, GLU61, PHE98, GLN103, ASP163 and LEU152. The order of binding affinities of these flavonoids toward the CDK6/cyclin D was M03 &gt; M01 &gt; M07 &gt; M15 &gt; M06 &gt; M05 &gt; M04. It is anticipated that the binding features of flavonoid inhibitors studied in the present work may provide valuable insights for the development of CDK6 inhibitors.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196651</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jingxiao Zhang, Lilei Zhang, Yangcheng Xu, Shanshan Jiang, Yueyue Shao&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and patient-level genetic assessments can guide therapy choice and impact prognosis. However, little is known about the impact of genetic variability within a tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), on disease progression or outcome. Current approaches using bulk tumor specimens can suggest the presence of ITH, but only single-cell genetic methods have the resolution to describe the underlying clonal structures themselves. Current techniques tend to be labor and resource intensive and challenging to characterize with respect to sources of biological and technical variability. We have developed a platform using a microfluidic self-digitization chip to partition cells in stationary volumes for cell imaging and allele-specific PCR. Genotyping data from only confirmed single-cell volumes is obtained and subject to a variety of relevant quality control assessments such as allele dropout, false positive, and false negative rates. We demonstrate single-cell genotyping of the &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt; type A mutation, an important prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukemia, on single cells of the cell line OCI-AML3, describing a more complex zygosity distribution than would be predicted via bulk analysis.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196801</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alison M.

It will serve as a basis for a model which will better account for the variability which is inherent to the experimental protocol used for the model calibration.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006148</originId><updated>1524776400000</updated><engagement>1</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006148</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163032286b6:a8a5f:ed160cc3</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><crawled>1524765984438</crawled><published>1524776400000</published><fingerprint>3c9cd4af</fingerprint><title>Organization of the core respiratory network: Insights from optogenetic and modeling studies</title><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Ausborn, Hidehiko Koizumi, William H.

The circuit organization within the mammalian brainstem respiratory network, specifically within and between the pre-Bötzinger (pre-BötC) and Bötzinger (BötC) complexes, and the roles of these circuits in respiratory pattern generation are continuously debated. We address these issues with a combination of optogenetic experiments and modeling studies. We used transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 under the VGAT-promoter to investigate perturbations of respiratory circuit activity by site-specific photostimulation of inhibitory neurons within the pre-BötC or BötC. The stimulation effects were dependent on the intensity and phase of the photostimulation. Specifically: (1) Low intensity (≤ 1.0 mW) pulses delivered to the pre-BötC during inspiration did not terminate activity, whereas stronger stimulations (≥ 2.0 mW) terminated inspiration. (2) When the pre-BötC stimulation ended in or was applied during expiration, rebound activation of inspiration occurred after a fixed latency. (3) Relatively weak sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–2.0 mW) of pre-BötC inhibitory neurons increased respiratory frequency, while a further increase of stimulus intensity (&gt; 3.0 mW) reduced frequency and finally (≥ 5.0 mW) terminated respiratory oscillations. (4) Single pulses (0.2–5.0 s) applied to the BötC inhibited rhythmic activity for the duration of the stimulation. (5) Sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–3.0 mW) of the BötC reduced respiratory frequency and finally led to apnea. We have revised our computational model of pre-BötC and BötC microcircuits by incorporating an additional population of post-inspiratory inhibitory neurons in the pre-BötC that interacts with other neurons in the network. This model was able to reproduce the above experimental findings as well as previously published results of optogenetic activation of pre-BötC or BötC neurons obtained by other laboratories. The proposed organization of pre-BötC and BötC circuits leads to testable predictions about their specific roles in respiratory pattern generation and provides important insights into key circuit interactions operating within brainstem respiratory networks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2-EXg_xghbA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Ausborn, Hidehiko Koizumi, William H.

Lipids are important structural and functional components of the skin. Alterations in the lipid composition of the epidermis are associated with inflammation and can affect the barrier function of the skin. SHARPIN-deficient &lt;i&gt;cpdm&lt;/i&gt; mice develop a chronic dermatitis with similarities to atopic dermatitis in humans. Here, we used a recently-developed approach named multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling and single ion monitoring to rapidly identify discriminative lipid ions. Shorter fatty acyl residues and increased relative amounts of sphingosine ceramides were observed in &lt;i&gt;cpdm&lt;/i&gt; epidermis compared to wild type mice. These changes were accompanied by downregulation of the &lt;i&gt;Fasn&lt;/i&gt; gene which encodes fatty acid synthase. A profile of diverse lipids was generated by fast screening of over 300 transitions (ion pairs). Tentative attribution of the most significant transitions was confirmed by product ion scan (MS/MS), and the MRM-profiling linear intensity response was validated with a C17-ceramide lipid standard. Relative quantification of sphingosine ceramides CerAS(d18:1/24:0)2OH, CerAS(d18:1/16:0)2OH and CerNS(d18:1/16:0) discriminated between the two groups with 100% accuracy, while the free fatty acids cerotic acid, 16-hydroxy palmitic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had 96.4% of accuracy. Validation by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the above-mentioned ceramides was in agreement with MRM-profiling results. Identification and rapid monitoring of these lipids represent a tool to assess therapeutic outcomes in SHARPIN-deficient mice and other mouse models of dermatitis and may have diagnostic utility in atopic dermatitis.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196595</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jackeline Franco, Christina Ferreira, Tiago J.

Pollen analysis is widely used to verify the geographic origin of honeys, but has never been employed in Australia. In this study, we analysed the pollen content of 173 unblended honey samples sourced from most of the commercial honey producing regions in southern Australia. Southern Australian vegetation is dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; (Myrtaceae) forests and, as expected, most Australian honeys are palynologically dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;, while other important components include Myrtaceae taxa such as &lt;i&gt;Corymbia&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Angophora&lt;/i&gt; and the tribe Leptospermeae; plus Brassicaceae, &lt;i&gt;Echium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Macadamia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acacia&lt;/i&gt;. An important feature of the honeys is the number of Myrtaceae pollen morphotypes per sample, which is generally high (mean = 4.6) compared to honeys produced outside of Australia, including &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys produced in the Mediterranean region, and honeys produced in South America, which has its own rich indigenous Myrtaceae flora. In the latter regions, the number of Myrtaceae morphotypes is apparently generally ≤2. A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.6.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-f?rss=1</originId><engagement>1</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-f?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7ca:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Dynamic fibrils drive protein assembly</title><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><published>1525974002000</published><fingerprint>79c46d1d</fingerprint><author><name>Vinson, V.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-f?rss=1</href></item></alternate><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3779</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3779.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>15</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3779.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162d525c55d:348c31e:34f43e70</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>The Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system can modulate host intestinal mechanics to displace gut bacterial symbionts [Microbiology]</title><crawled>1523994445149</crawled><published>1523990209000</published><fingerprint>e0cc92d8</fingerprint><author><name>Savannah L.

Byrne, Soren Gantt, Daniel Coombs&lt;/p&gt;
Patients with Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2) infection face a significantly higher risk of contracting HIV-1. This is thought to be due to herpetic lesions serving as entry points for HIV-1 and tissue-resident CD4+ T cell counts increasing during HSV-2 lesional events. We have created a stochastic and spatial mathematical model describing the dynamics of HSV-2 infection and immune response in the genital mucosa. Using our model, we first study the dynamics of a developing HSV-2 lesion. We then use our model to quantify the risk of infection with HIV-1 following sexual exposure in HSV-2 positive women. Untreated, we find that HSV-2 infected women are up to 8.6 times more likely to acquire HIV-1 than healthy patients. However, when including the effects of the HSV-2 antiviral drug, pritelivir, the risk of HIV-1 infection is predicted to decrease by up to 35%, depending on drug dosage. We estimate the relative importance of decreased tissue damage versus decreased CD4+ cell presence in determining the effectiveness of pritelivir in reducing HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest that clinical trials should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of pritelivir or similar agents in preventing HIV-1 infection in HSV-2 positive women.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gAxRWv6Wb-g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Catherine M.

Background &lt;p&gt;South Africa has a high burden of MDR-TB, and to provide accessible treatment the government has introduced different models of care. We report the most cost-effective model after comparing cost per patient successfully treated across 5 models of care: centralized hospital, district hospitals (2), and community-based care through clinics or mobile injection teams.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In an observational study five cohorts were followed prospectively. The cost analysis adopted a provider perspective and economic cost per patient successfully treated was calculated based on country protocols and length of treatment per patient per model of care. Logistic regression was used to calculate propensity score weights, to compare pairs of treatment groups, whilst adjusting for baseline imbalances between groups. Propensity score weighted costs and treatment success rates were used in the ICER analysis. Sensitivity analysis focused on varying treatment success and length of hospitalization within each model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 1,038 MDR-TB patients 75% were HIV-infected and 56% were successfully treated. The cost per successfully treated patient was 3 to 4.5 times lower in the community-based models with no hospitalization.

Overall, the Mobile model was the most cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Reducing the length of hospitalization and following community-based models of care improves the affordability of MDR-TB treatment without compromising its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</originId><updated>1524776400000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae77:fc1f8953</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Altered dopaminergic regulation of the dorsal striatum is able to induce tic-like movements in juvenile rats</title><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><published>1524776400000</published><fingerprint>20889c29</fingerprint><author><name>Ester Nespoli</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ester Nespoli, Francesca Rizzo, Tobias Boeckers, Ulrike Schulze, Bastian Hengerer&lt;/p&gt;
Motor tics are sudden, repetitive, involuntary movements representing the hallmark behaviors of the neurodevelopmental disease Tourette’s syndrome (TS). The primary cause of TS remains unclear. The initial observation that dopaminergic antagonists alleviate tics led to the development of a dopaminergic theory of TS etiology which is supported by &lt;i&gt;post mortem&lt;/i&gt; and in vivo studies indicating that non-physiological activation of the striatum could generate tics. The striatum controls movement execution through the balanced activity of dopamine receptor D1 and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons of the direct and indirect pathway, respectively.

Large-scale insertional mutagenesis screens can be powerful genome-wide tools if they are streamlined with efficient downstream analysis, which is a serious bottleneck in complex biological systems. A major impediment to the success of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based screens for virulence factors is that the genetic material of pathogens is often underrepresented within the eukaryotic host, making detection extremely challenging. We therefore established insertion Pool-Sequencing (iPool-Seq) on maize infected with the biotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maydis&lt;/i&gt;. iPool-Seq features tagmentation, unique molecular barcodes, and affinity purification of pathogen insertion mutant DNA from in vivo-infected tissues. In a proof of concept using iPool-Seq, we identified 28 virulence factors, including 23 that were previously uncharacterized, from an initial pool of 195 candidate effector mutants. Because of its sensitivity and quantitative nature, iPool-Seq can be applied to any insertional mutagenesis library and is especially suitable for genetically complex setups like pooled infections of eukaryotic hosts.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/I200kmApCCw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Simon Uhse, Florian G.

The controlled formation and stabilization of E-cadherin-based adhesions is vital for epithelial integrity.

The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Kaiser, Sebastian Bittrich, Sebastian Salentin, Christoph Leberecht, V.

Reconfigurations of synchronized large-scale networks are thought to be central neural mechanisms that support cognition and behavior in the human brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings together with recent advances in network analysis now allow for sub-second snapshots of such networks. In the present study, we compared frequency-resolved functional connectivity patterns underlying reading of single words and visual recognition of symbol strings. Word reading emphasized coherence in a left-lateralized network with nodes in classical perisylvian language regions, whereas symbol processing recruited a bilateral network, including connections between frontal and parietal regions previously associated with spatial attention and visual working memory. Our results illustrate the flexible nature of functional networks, whereby processing of different form categories, written words vs. symbol strings, leads to the formation of large-scale functional networks that operate at distinct oscillatory frequencies and incorporate task-relevant regions. These results suggest that category-specific processing should be viewed not so much as a local process but as a distributed neural process implemented in signature networks. For words, increased coherence was detected particularly in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and high gamma (60–90 Hz) frequency bands, whereas increased coherence for symbol strings was observed in the high beta (21–29 Hz) and low gamma (30–45 Hz) frequency range. These findings attest to the role of coherence in specific frequency bands as a general mechanism for integrating stimulus-dependent information across brain regions.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mia Liljeström, Johanna Vartiainen, Jan Kujala, Riitta Salmelin&lt;/p&gt;

Not because it’s useful – that’s already known – but because it can explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b00270&quot;&gt;Here’s the paper&lt;/a&gt; (from UC-Irvine and Amgen), and the compound is the 4-azido derivative of phenylalanine. Interestingly, the authors were not trying to investigate its hazards, but were after an easier, safer, and cheaper synthetic route. They succeeded, by the way, along with providing some valuable reference work about how to determine its chiral purity and also (re)establishing a poorly characterized coupling reagent (Boc-Oxyma) as a useful species. Now, some people will look at this target compound and say “Well, yeah, sure, azide”, but organoazides are not all explosive. The lower the molecular weight, the more likely you are to run into trouble, but there are smaller azides than this one that still aren’t a problem to handle. I’ll say right off that I don’t know of any incidents with azido-Phe, which is a good thing, but the data in this paper suggest that such an incident is certainly possible. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns about the synthetic routes to this compound, I should note, is the presence of an azide ion / copper combination. It is a very solid general rule to avoid the formation of any transition-metal or heavy-metal azide species; they should all be considered explosion hazards (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/08/28/mercury_azides_ill_get_right_on_those_for_you&quot;&gt;“Things I Won’t Work With” reference&lt;/a&gt;, for emphasis). Want some more backing for that statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The sensitivity of dry cupric azide to friction is so great that it is prone to explosion &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/257189.pdf&quot;&gt;during its removal&lt;/a&gt; from filter paper. Copper(I) azide (cuprous azide) is similarly perilous, and explosions have been reported for this complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.19110244402&quot;&gt;while completely submerged&lt;/a&gt; in water and after being lightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/257189.pdf&quot;&gt;touched with a feather&lt;/a&gt; in open air. An intelligence bulletin from The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health warned in 1976 that several explosions had occurred in the United States and Canada, apparently resulting from the accumulation of heavy-metal azides in hospital plumbing. These events were likely due to the routine disposal of NaN3-laced waste from automatic blood cell counting machines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/78-127/78127_13.html&quot;&gt;directly into hospital drains&lt;/a&gt;. Since many of these incidents occurred while attempting to clear a blocked pipe, it seems unlikely that any metal azides present were dry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said the manuscript, dryly. So no, I don’t think we’ll be wanting any copper azide species if that can be helped (the covalent azides used in the copper-catalyzed “click” reaction are a different thing altogether). Since this new synthesis does still involve a copper-catalyzed azide formation, the authors carefully investigated the material in each step for explosion hazards. The good news is that none of the intermediates (nor the precipitates formed) seem to be hazardous. The bad news is that the final product is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was determined through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a technique where a (small!) sample is heated to increasing temperatures and monitored for excess heat being given off (exothermic decomposition), and its partner technique, accelerating-rate calorimetry (ARC). What these show is that the N-Boc derivative of azido-Phe is possibly a cause for concern, but the unprotected species is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; a problem. Its calorimetric behavior is similar to that of a high explosive, and it appears as if it could be shock-sensitive as well. I would say that this problem is unappreciated in the chemical literature, and it’s a good thing that no one discovered this the hard way. Perhaps a salt of the compound has better behavior and would be a safer reagent and article of commerce?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A universal turnaround has been detected in many countries of the World from shrinking to expanding forests. The forest area of western Europe expanded already in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Such early trends of forest resources cannot be associated with the rapid rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide nor with the anthropogenic climate change, which have taken place since the mid 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Modern, most recent spatial patterns of forest expansions and contractions do not correlate with the geography of climate trends nor with dry versus moist areas. Instead, the forest resources trends of nations correlate positively with UNDP Human Development Index. This indicates that forest resources of nations have improved along with progress in human well-being. Highly developed countries apply modern agricultural methods on good farmlands and abandon marginal lands, which become available for forest expansion. Developed countries invest in sustainable programs of forest management and nature protection. Our findings are significant for predicting the future of the terrestrial carbon sink. They suggest that the large sink of carbon recently observed in forests of the World will persist, if the well-being of people continues to improve.

Larvae of parasitoid wasps develop on a single arthropod host, and often face resource limitation that induces a tradeoff between egg maturation and somatic growth. Part of the variation in the growth-reproduction allocation was shown to be heritable, but how the larval developmental environment affects this allocation is not well-known. Detection of life history tradeoffs is often facilitated under stress conditions. We therefore exposed developing female larvae of the polyembryonic parasitoid &lt;i&gt;Copidosoma koehleri&lt;/i&gt; (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) to laboratory manipulations aimed to restrict host resources (either host-starvation or high larval density). We compared the females’ body sizes and egg loads shortly after adult emergence (&amp;lt;24 h) to those of closely related control females, which developed at a lower larval density within non-starved hosts. Host-starvation reduced the females’ body sizes but not their initial egg loads. Females that experienced high larval density produced more eggs but were similar in body size to the low-density controls. Thus, the relative allocation to reproduction increased in response to both manipulations of host condition. Developmental duration and longevity were similar in all treatments. The negative correlation between body size and reproductive allocation, observed in the host-starvation treatment, is compatible with previous evidence from other parasitoids. In the high larval density treatment, however, reproductive allocation increased while body size was maintained, suggesting that the higher density increased rather than limited host resources per developing parasitoid female. The additional host resources that were diverted into egg production possibly resulted from increased feeding and body mass gain by hosts parasitized by large broods of wasps. Our results demonstrate phenotypic plasticity in resource allocation between growth and reproduction in a developing parasitoid. This plasticity may contribute to an adaptive balance between longevity and mobility vs. fecundity during the adult stage.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195767</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yael Keinan, Rachel Braun, Tamar Keasar&lt;/p&gt;

Dolan, Zeb Kurth-Nelson&lt;/p&gt;
Humans have a remarkable ability to simulate the minds of others. How the brain distinguishes between mental states attributed to self and mental states attributed to someone else is unknown. Here, we investigated how fundamental neural learning signals are selectively attributed to different agents. Specifically, we asked whether learning signals are encoded in agent-specific neural patterns or whether a self–other distinction depends on encoding agent identity separately from this learning signal. To examine this, we tasked subjects to learn continuously 2 models of the same environment, such that one was selectively attributed to self and the other was selectively attributed to another agent. Combining computational modelling with magnetoencephalography (MEG) enabled us to track neural representations of prediction errors (PEs) and beliefs attributed to self, and of simulated PEs and beliefs attributed to another agent. We found that the representational pattern of a PE reliably predicts the identity of the agent to whom the signal is attributed, consistent with a neural self–other distinction implemented via agent-specific learning signals. Strikingly, subjects exhibiting a weaker neural self–other distinction also had a reduced behavioural capacity for self–other distinction and displayed more marked subclinical psychopathological traits. The neural self–other distinction was also modulated by social context, evidenced in a significantly reduced decoding of agent identity in a nonsocial control task. Thus, we show that self–other distinction is realised through an encoding of agent identity intrinsic to fundamental learning signals. The observation that the fidelity of this encoding predicts psychopathological traits is of interest as a potential neurocomputational psychiatric biomarker.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/l0SSGSKOA4E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sam Ereira, Raymond J.

However, gene-annotation enrichment queries utilizing these resources can provide thousands of results with weak statistical significance that may be difficult to interpret without manually sorting into higher-order categories.

Little is known about people’s ability to detect subclinical psychopathy from others’ quotidian social behavior, or about the correlates of variation in this ability. This study sought to address these questions using a thin slice personality judgment paradigm. We presented 108 undergraduate judges (70.4% female) with 1.5 minute video thin slices of zero-acquaintance triadic conversations among other undergraduates (targets: n = 105, 57.1% female). Judges completed self-report measures of general trust, caution, and empathy. Target individuals had completed the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP) scale. Judges viewed the videos in one of three conditions: complete audio, silent, or audio from which semantic content had been removed using low-pass filtering. Using a novel other-rating version of the LSRP, judges’ ratings of targets’ primary psychopathy levels were significantly positively associated with targets’ self-reports, but only in the complete audio condition. Judge general trust and target LSRP interacted, such that judges higher in general trust made less accurate judgments with respect to targets higher in primary and total psychopathy. Results are consistent with a scenario in which psychopathic traits are maintained in human populations by negative frequency dependent selection operating through the costs of detecting psychopathy in others.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joseph H.

The HIV-1 nucleocapsid 7 (NCp7) plays crucial roles in multiple stages of HIV-1 life cycle, and its biological functions rely on the binding of zinc ions. Understanding the molecular mechanism of how the zinc ions modulate the conformational dynamics and functions of the NCp7 is essential for the drug development and HIV-1 treatment. In this work, using a structure-based coarse-grained model, we studied the effects of zinc cofactors on the folding and target RNA(SL3) recognition of the NCp7 by molecular dynamics simulations. After reproducing some key properties of the zinc binding and folding of the NCp7 observed in previous experiments, our simulations revealed several interesting features in the metal ion modulated folding and target recognition. Firstly, we showed that the zinc binding makes the folding transition states of the two zinc fingers less structured, which is in line with the Hammond effect observed typically in mutation, temperature or denaturant induced perturbations to protein structure and stability. Secondly, We showed that there exists mutual interplay between the zinc ion binding and NCp7-target recognition. Binding of zinc ions enhances the affinity between the NCp7 and the target RNA, whereas the formation of the NCp7-RNA complex reshapes the intrinsic energy landscape of the NCp7 and increases the stability and zinc affinity of the two zinc fingers. Thirdly, by characterizing the effects of salt concentrations on the target RNA recognition, we showed that the NCp7 achieves optimal balance between the affinity and binding kinetics near the physiologically relevant salt concentrations. In addition, the effects of zinc binding on the inter-domain conformational flexibility and folding cooperativity of the NCp7 were also discussed.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196662</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Weitong Ren, Dongqing Ji, Xiulian Xu&lt;/p&gt;

This proteomics-based strategy provides insight into host defense responses, establishes potentially useful targets for therapeutic intervention, and presents biomarkers for determining affected organs during bacterial infection.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img width=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2405471218301509-fx1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Teaser&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div&gt;Group A &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GAS) pathogenesis has largely been studied from a bacteria-centric perspective.

Individuals with low levels of education systematically have worse health than those with medium or high levels of education. Yet there are few examples of attempts to summarize the evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions targeting health-related behavior among individuals with low education levels, and a large part of the literature is descriptive rather than analytical. A rapid review was carried out to examine the impact of such interventions. Special attention was given to the relative impact of the interventions among individuals with low education levels and their potential to reduce health inequality. Of 1,365 articles initially identified, only 31 were deemed relevant for the review, and of those, nine met the inclusion and quality criteria. The comparability of included studies was limited due to differences in study design, sample characteristics, and definitions of exposure and outcome variables. Therefore, instead of performing a formal meta-analysis, an overall assessment of the available evidence was made and summarized into some general conclusions. We found no support for the notion that the methods used to reduce smoking decrease inequalities in health between educational groups. Evidence was also limited for decreasing inequality through interventions regarding dietary intake, physical activity and mental health. Only one study was found using an intervention designed to decrease socioeconomic inequalities by increasing the use of breast cancer screening. Thus, we concluded that there is a lack of support regarding this type of intervention as well. Therefore, the main conclusion is that solid evidence is lacking for interventions aimed at individual determinants of health and that more research is needed to fill this gap in knowledge.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195774</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Vilhelmsson, Per-Olof Östergren&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to express a gene of interest in a spatio-temporal manner using Gal4-UAS system has allowed the use of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; model to study various biological phenomenon. During &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; eye development, a synchronous wave of differentiation called Morphogenetic furrow (MF) initiates at the posterior margin resulting in differentiation of retinal neurons. This synchronous differentiation is also observed in the differentiating retina of vertebrates. Since MF is highly dynamic, it can serve as an excellent model to study patterning and differentiation. However, there are not any Gal4 drivers available to observe the gain- of- function or loss- of- function of a gene specifically along the dynamic MF. The &lt;i&gt;decapentaplegic (dpp)&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes a secreted protein of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that expresses at the posterior margin and then moves with the MF. However, unlike the MF associated pattern of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene expression, the targeted &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver expression is restricted to the posterior margin of the developing eye disc. We screened GMR lines harboring regulatory regions of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; fused with Gal4 coding region to identify MF specific enhancer of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; using a GFP reporter gene. We employed immuno-histochemical approaches to detect gene expression. The rationale was that GFP reporter expression will correspond to the &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; expression domain in the developing eye. We identified two new &lt;i&gt;dpp-&lt;/i&gt;Gal4 lines, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 and &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 that carry sequences from first intron region of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene. &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression along the MF during development and later in the entire pupal retina whereas &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression of GFP transgene in the entire developing eye disc, which later drives expression only in the ventral half of the pupal retina. Thus, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 will serve as a new reagent for targeting gene expression in the ventral half of the pupal retina. We compared misexpression phenotypes of Wg, a negative regulator of eye development, using &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 with existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver. The eye phenotypes generated by using our newly identified MF specific driver are not similar to the ones generated by existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fish oil (FO) with palm oil (PO) in juvenile Nile tilapia, &lt;i&gt;Oreochromis niloticus&lt;/i&gt; (9.34± 0.02g initial weight) with emphasis on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities as well as serum biochemical parameters. Also, lysozyme activity (LYZ), respiratory burst (RB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and resistance to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; were investigated. Fish were stocked in 15 rectangular fiber glass tanks (150× 60× 40 cm) at 40 fish per tank with water maintained at 210 litres. Fish were fed five isonitrogenous (33% crude protein) and isolipidic (10% lipid) diets with PO included at 0% (0% PO), 25% (25% PO), 50% (50%PO), 75% (75% PO) and 100% (100% PO) for 8 weeks. The findings demonstrated that growth, and feed utilization was not compromised when PO was used in place of FO either partially or totally. Except for protease activity which was not significantly altered, lipase and amylase activities were significantly altered when FO was replaced with PO. There were no significant differences among treatments for CAT, SOD and LYZ. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) in fish fed 100% PO was significantly lower than all other groups whiles total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of fish fed 0% PO was significantly higher than all other groups. Fish fed 0% PO, 25% PO and 50% PO had glutathione reductase (GR) significantly higher than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. RB in fish fed 0% PO were significantly lower than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. Also, fish fed 0% PO had significantly lower total protein (TP) compared with groups fed 50% PO and 75% PO. Fish fed diets with PO had similar resistance ability to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; as those fed diets with FO. However, the liver function was likely to be compromised due to the increase in aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatas (ALP) along increasing PO inclusion levels. AST, total protein, triacylglycerol (TAG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0.05) in groups fed higher levels of PO. This study therefore concludes that feeding tilapia fingerlings with diets containing PO affects antioxidant and innate immune parameters negatively due to the reduction in LYS, TAC, GR, MDA, CAT, SOD and GSHpx.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196100</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Larbi Ayisi, Jinliang Zhao, Jun-Wei Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Characterisation and thermal deterioration of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk is presented for the first time using the potential of Fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission bands in non-heated desi ghee centred at 375 nm is labelled for vitamin D, 390 nm for vitamin K, 440–460 nm for isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), 490 nm for vitamin A and the region 620–700 nm is assigned to chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission spectra from all the heated and non-heated ghee samples were recorded using excitation wavelengths at 280, and 410 nm which were found best for getting maximum spectral signatures. Heating of desi ghee affects its molecular composition, however, the temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be defined safe for cooking /frying where it does not lose much of its molecular composition. Further, the rise in temperature induces prominent spectral variations which confirm the deterioration of valuable vitamins, isomers of CLA and chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission peak at 552 nm shows oxidation product and an increase in its intensity with the rise in temperature is observed. In order to classify heated samples at different temperatures, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on heated and non-heated ghee samples that further elucidated the temperature effects.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197340</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naveed Ahmad, M.

McCarthy, Philip A. Eckhoff, Guillaume Chabot-Couture&lt;/p&gt;
The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of 10,000 or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist in which OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multi-scale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/To91iFbN0F4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Famulare, Christian Selinger, Kevin A. McCarthy, Philip A. Eckhoff, Guillaume Chabot-Couture&lt;/p&gt;
The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of 10,000 or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist in which OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multi-scale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/To91iFbN0F4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/To91iFbN0F4/article</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002468</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><author><name>Michael Famulare</name></author><recrawled>1524851645910</recrawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03957-8</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03957-8</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163202d4dde:31716b:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Systematic mapping of contact sites reveals tethers and a function for the peroxisome-mitochondria contact</title><crawled>1525253230046</crawled><published>1525244400000</published><fingerprint>44d85524</fingerprint><author><name>Nadav Shai</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Systematic mapping of contact sites reveals tethers and a function for the peroxisome-mitochondria contact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic mapping of contact sites reveals tethers and a function for the peroxisome-mitochondria contact, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03957-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03957-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The internal organization of the cell has been enriched by the discovery that organelles establish membrane contact sites, however the entire repertoire of these contacts is still being explored.

For the last 100 years, it has been uncontroversial to state that the plant germline is set aside late in development, but there is surprisingly little evidence to support this view. In contrast, much evolutionary theory and several recent empirical studies seem to suggest the opposite—that the germlines of some and perhaps most plants may be set aside early in development. But is this really the case? How much does it matter? How can we reconcile the new evidence with existing knowledge of plant development? And is there a way to reliably establish the timing of germline segregation in both model and nonmodel plants? Answering these questions is vital to understanding one of the most fundamental aspects of plant development and evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0LiCyHbkEf4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Lanfear&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last decades, the treatment of schizophrenia has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. In this study, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on social cognitive and nonsocial neurocognitive functions, as well as on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, in individuals with schizophrenia. Thirty-seven individuals with schizophrenia were administered one of three different tDCS conditions (cathodal, anodal, and sham) per visit over the course of three visits, with approximately one week between each visit. Order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. For the active conditions, the electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the reference electrode over right supraorbital cortex. Current intensity was 2 mA and was maintained for two 20-minute sessions, with a one hour break between the sessions. Assessments were conducted immediately following each session, in a counterbalanced order of administration. No systematic effects were found across the social and nonsocial cognitive domains, and no significant effects were detected on event-related potentials (ERPs). The very small effect sizes, further validated by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; power analyses (large Critical Ns), demonstrated that these findings were not due to lack of statistical power. Except for mild local discomfort, no significant side effects were reported. Findings demonstrate the safety and ease of administration of this procedure, but suggest that a single dose of tDCS over these areas does not yield a therapeutic effect on cognition in schizophrenia.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA. HMR programs provide weekly group coaching to achieve reduced calorie intake, increased fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity ≥2,000 kcal/wk. A Markov model predicted avoidance of diabetes and cardiovascular events and projected cost savings due to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 500 patients included in the analysis, 67% were female and mean age was 54.1 years (s.d. 11.6). The baseline weight and BMI were 243.5 lbs (range 144.0–545.0) and 38.8 kg/m2 (range 25.4–85.0), respectively.

Isolated mitochondria are widely used to study the function of the organelle. Typically, mitochondria are prepared using differential centrifugation alone or in conjunction with density gradient ultracentrifugation. However, mitochondria isolated using differential centrifugation contain membrane or organelle contaminants, and further purification of crude mitochondria by density gradient ultracentrifugation requires large amounts of starting material, and is time-consuming. Mitochondria have also been isolated by irreversible binding to antibody-coated magnetic beads. We developed a method to prepare mitochondria from budding yeast that overcomes many of the limitations of other methods. Mitochondria are tagged by insertion of 6 histidines (6xHis) into the &lt;i&gt;TOM70&lt;/i&gt; (Translocase of outer membrane 70) gene at its chromosomal locus, isolated using Ni-NTA (nickel (II) nitrilotriacetic acid) paramagnetic beads and released from the magnetic beads by washing with imidazole. Mitochondria prepared using this method contain fewer contaminants, and are similar in ultrastructure as well as protein import and cytochrome c oxidase complex activity compared to mitochondria isolated by differential centrifugation. Moreover, this isolation method is amenable to small samples, faster than purification by differential and density gradient centrifugation, and more cost-effective than purification using antibody-coated magnetic beads. Importantly, this method can be applied to any cell type where the genetic modification can be introduced by CRISPR or other methods.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196632</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pin-Chao Liao, Istvan R.

Serum starvation is a routine protocol for synchronizing nuclear donor cells to G0/G1 phase during somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, abrupt serum deprivation can cause serious stress to the cells cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, which might result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, chromosome damage, and finally reduce the success rate of SCNT. In the present study, the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an effective ER stress-relieving drug, on the nuclear donor cells under serum deprivation condition as well as following SCNT procedures were first assessed in the bovine. The results showed that TUDCA significantly reduced ER stress and cell apoptosis in those nuclear donor cells. Moreover, it significantly decreased the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt;, and increased the level of H3K9 acetylation in nuclear donor cells compared with control group. SCNT reconstructed embryos cloned from TUDCA-treated donor cells showed significantly higher fusion, cleavage, blastocyst formation rate, total cell number in day 7 blastocysts, and lower apoptotic index than that from control group. In addition, the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bax&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in blastocysts derived from TUDCA-treated donor cells than that from control group.

Cathepsin B (CTSB), a lysososmal protease involved in cellular degradation process, is recently been studied as a potential candidate gene in the pathogenesis of TCP.

The results from in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these variants in the propeptide region of cathepsin B could lead to structural and functional changes in the protein.

This work presents an alternative device for cancer screening in liquid biopsies. It combines a biomimetic film (i) with electrochemical detection (ii). The biomimetic film (i) was obtained by electro-polymerizing amine-substituted benzene rings around a CA 15–3 target. This protein target was previously adsorbed on a gold (Au) support and incubated in charged monomers (4-Styrenesulfonate sodium and 3-Hydroxytyraminium chloride). The protein was further eliminated by enzymatic activity, leaving behind vacant sites for subsequent rebinding. Electrochemical detection (ii) was achieved on an Au working electrode, designed on commercial screen-printed electrodes. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and ellipsometric readings were used to follow the chemical modification of the Au surface. The ability of the material to rebind CA15-3 was monitored by electrochemical techniques. The device displayed linear responses to CA15-3 ranging from 0.25 to 10.00 U/mL, with detection limits of 0.05 U/mL. Accurate results were obtained by applying the sensor to the analysis of CA15-3 in PBS buffer and in serum samples. This biosensing device displayed successful features for the detection of CA 15–3 and constitutes a promising tool for breast cancer screening procedures in point-of-care applications. Moreover, its scale-up seems feasible as it contains a plastic antibody assembled &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, in less than 1 minute, and the analysis of serum takes less than 30 minutes.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196656</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rui S.

The optimized IPEA value (0.25 a.u.), called standard IPEA (S‐IPEA), was recommended but due to its unsatisfactory performance in multiple metallic and organic compounds it has been questioned lately as a general parameter working properly for all molecules under CASPT2 study. As we are interested in Schiff bases of retinal, an important question emerging from this conflict of choice, to use or not to use S‐IPEA, is whether the introduction of the modified zeroth‐order Hamiltonian into CASPT2 ansatz does really improve their energetics. To achieve this goal, we assessed an impact of the IPEA shift value, in a range of 0–0.35 a.u., on vertical excitation energies to low‐lying singlet states of two protonated (RPSBs) and two unprotonated (RSBs) Schiff bases of retinal for which experimental data in gas phase are available.

The optimized IPEA value (0.25 a.u.), called standard IPEA (S‐IPEA), was recommended but due to its unsatisfactory performance in multiple metallic and organic compounds it has been questioned lately as a general parameter working properly for all molecules under CASPT2 study. As we are interested in Schiff bases of retinal, an important question emerging from this conflict of choice, to use or not to use S‐IPEA, is whether the introduction of the modified zeroth‐order Hamiltonian into CASPT2 ansatz does really improve their energetics. To achieve this goal, we assessed an impact of the IPEA shift value, in a range of 0–0.35 a.u., on vertical excitation energies to low‐lying singlet states of two protonated (RPSBs) and two unprotonated (RSBs) Schiff bases of retinal for which experimental data in gas phase are available. In addition, an effect of geometry, basis set, and active space on computed VEEs is also reported.

Neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are apicobasally elongated and densely packed in the developing brain, systematically move their nuclei/somata in a cell cycle–dependent manner, called interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM): apical during G2 and basal during G1. Although intracellular molecular mechanisms of individual IKNM have been explored, how heterogeneous IKNMs are collectively coordinated is unknown. Our quantitative cell-biological and in silico analyses revealed that tissue elasticity mechanically assists an initial step of basalward IKNM. When the soma of an M-phase progenitor cell rounds up using actomyosin within the subapical space, a microzone within 10 μm from the surface, which is compressed and elastic because of the apical surface’s contractility, laterally pushes the densely neighboring processes of non–M-phase cells. The pressed processes then recoil centripetally and basally to propel the nuclei/somata of the progenitor’s daughter cells. Thus, indirect neighbor-assisted transfer of mechanical energy from mother to daughter helps efficient brain development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QIHSf4hXHfg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoyasu Shinoda, Arata Nagasaka, Yasuhiro Inoue, Ryo Higuchi, Yoshiaki Minami, Kagayaki Kato, Makoto Suzuki, Takefumi Kondo, Takumi Kawaue, Kanako Saito, Naoto Ueno, Yugo Fukazawa, Masaharu Nagayama, Takashi Miura, Taiji Adachi, Takaki Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male &lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&lt;/i&gt;. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197259</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease, with considerable genetic contribution. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified a number of genomic regions for the risk of psoriasis. However, it is challenging to pinpoint the functional causal variants and then further decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying each region. In order to prioritize potential functional causal variants within psoriasis susceptibility regions, we integrated the genetic association findings and functional genomic data publicly available, i.e. histone modifications in relevant immune cells. We characterized a pervasive enrichment pattern of psoriasis variants in five core histone marks across immune cells/tissues. We discovered that genetic alleles within psoriasis association regions might influence gene expression levels through significantly affecting the binding affinities of 17 transcription factors. We established a catalog of 654 potential functional causal variants for psoriasis and suggested that they significantly overlapped with causal variants for autoimmune diseases. We identified potential causal variant rs79824801 overlay with the peaks of five histone marks in primary CD4+ T cells. Its alternative allele affected the binding affinity of transcription factor &lt;i&gt;IKZF1&lt;/i&gt;. This study highlights the complex genetic architecture and complicated mechanisms for psoriasis. The findings will inform the functional experiment design for psoriasis.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196635</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yan Lin, Lu Liu, Yujun Sheng, Changbing Shen, Xiaodong Zheng, Fusheng Zhou, Sen Yang, Xianyong Yin, Xuejun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Primary brain microvessels (BrMV) maintain the cellular characters and molecular signatures as displayed in vivo, and serve as a vital tool for biomedical research of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the development/optimization of brain drug delivery. The variations of relative purities or cellular composition among different BrMV samples may have significant consequences in data interpretation and research outcome, especially for experiments with high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable reference gene (RG) for accurate normalization of real-time RT-qPCR analysis, and determine the proper marker genes (MG) for relative purity assessment in BrMV samples. Out of five housekeeping genes, β-actin was selected as the most suitable RG that was validated by quantifying mRNA levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in BrMV isolated from mice with one or two expressing alleles. Four marker genes highly/selectively expressed in BBB-forming capillary endothelial cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR for purity assessment, resulting in &lt;i&gt;Cldn&lt;/i&gt;5 and &lt;i&gt;Pecam1&lt;/i&gt; as most suitable MGs that were further confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis of cellular components. &lt;i&gt;Plvap&lt;/i&gt; proved to be an indicator gene for the presence of fenestrated vessels in BrMV samples.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are one of the important factors in controlling gene expression and elucidation of their roles has been attracting great interest. We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196905</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Komura, Wataru Aoki, Keisuke Motone, Atsushi Satomura, Mitsuyoshi Ueda&lt;/p&gt;

The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/17/302471</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302471v2?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302471v2?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162d4f5c8bb:33c76b6:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Identification of Key Proteins Involved in Axon Guidance Related Disorders: A Systems Biology Approach [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1523991300283</crawled><published>1523948400000</published><fingerprint>56a84d14</fingerprint><author><name>Ahammad, I.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Axon guidance is a crucial process for growth of the central and peripheral nervous systems.

This could be applied to assess visual cortex activity in MS diagnosis and evolution studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05022-2</originId><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>363</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05022-2</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16317ecc0b7:1f794ac:4e164c41</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Brazil’s lawmakers renew push to weaken environmental rules</title><crawled>1525114781879</crawled><published>1525071600000</published><fingerprint>fc594d8f</fingerprint><author><name>Jeff Tollefson</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brazil’s lawmakers renew push to weaken environmental rules&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s lawmakers renew push to weaken environmental rules, Published online: 30 April 2018;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The inconclusive clinical results for ST-waveform analysis (STAN) in detecting fetal hypoxemia may be caused by the signal processing of the STAN-device itself. We assessed the performance of a clinical STAN device in signal processing and in detecting hypoxemia in a fetal sheep model exposed to prolonged umbilical cord occlusion (UCO).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight fetal lambs were exposed to 25 minutes of UCO. ECG recordings were analyzed during a baseline period and during UCO. STAN-event rates and timing of episodic T/QRS rise, baseline T/QRS rise and the occurrence of biphasic ST-waveforms, as well as signal loss, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During baseline conditions of normoxemia, a median of 40 (IQR, 25–70) STAN-events per minute were detected, compared to 10 (IQR, 2–22) during UCO. During UCO STAN-events were detected in five subjects within 10 minutes and in six subjects after 18 minutes, respectively. Two subjects did not generate any STAN-event during UCO. Biphasic ST event rate was reduced during UCO (median 0, IQR 0–5), compared to baseline (median 32, IQR, 6–55). ST-waveforms could not be assessed in 62% of the recording time during UCO, despite a good quality of the ECG signal.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The STAN device showed limitations in detecting hypoxemia in fetal sheep after prolonged UCO. The STAN device produced high false positive event rates during baseline and did not detect T/QRS changes adequately after prolonged fetal hypoxemia. During 14% of baseline and 62% of the UCO period, the STAN-device could not process the ECG signal, despite its good quality.

Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) and mouse models of hair graying serve as useful systems to uncover mechanisms involved in stem cell self-renewal and the maintenance of regenerating tissues. Interested in assessing genetic variants that influence McSC maintenance, we found previously that heterozygosity for the melanogenesis associated transcription factor, &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;, exacerbates McSC differentiation and hair graying in mice that are predisposed for this phenotype. Based on transcriptome and molecular analyses of &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;mi-vga9/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we report a novel role for MITF in the regulation of systemic innate immune gene expression. We also demonstrate that the viral mimic poly(I:C) is sufficient to expose genetic susceptibility to hair graying. These observations point to a critical suppressor of innate immunity, the consequences of innate immune dysregulation on pigmentation, both of which may have implications in the autoimmune, depigmenting disease, vitiligo.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N1nbD-4XsNQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa L.

Disease tolerance is a defense strategy against infections that aims at maintaining host health even at high pathogen replication or load. Tolerance mechanisms are currently intensively studied with the long-term goal of exploiting them therapeutically. Because tolerance-based treatment imposes less selective pressure on the pathogen it has been hypothesised to be “evolution-proof”. However, the primary public health goal is to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with a disease. From this perspective, tolerance-based treatment bears the risk of increasing the prevalence of the disease, which may lead to increased mortality. We assessed the promise of tolerance-based treatment strategies using mathematical models. Conventional treatment was implemented as an increased recovery rate, while tolerance-based treatment was assumed to reduce the disease-related mortality of infected hosts without affecting recovery. We investigated the endemic phase of two types of infections: acute and chronic. Additionally, we considered the effect of pathogen resistance against conventional treatment. We show that, for low coverage of tolerance-based treatment, chronic infections can cause even more deaths than without treatment. Overall, we found that conventional treatment always outperforms tolerance-based treatment, even when we allow the emergence of pathogen resistance. Our results cast doubt on the potential benefit of tolerance-based over conventional treatment. Any clinical application of tolerance-based treatment of infectious diseases has to consider the associated detrimental epidemiological feedback.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C5jRnX8QuMo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathanaël Hozé, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Roland Regoes&lt;/p&gt;

Stressor-exposure has been shown to exacerbate inflammation and change the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota; however stressor-induced effects on microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors are unknown. Thus, bacterial-produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as microbial community composition, were assessed in the colons of mice exposed to stress during infection with &lt;i&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/i&gt;. Mice were exposed to overnight restraint on 7 consecutive nights, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first exposure of restraint, mice were orally challenged with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt; or with vehicle. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SCFA levels measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Pathogen levels and colonic inflammation were also assessed 6 days post-infection. Results demonstrated that the microbial community structure and SCFA production were significantly affected by both stressor exposure and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt;-infection. Exposure to prolonged restraint in the absence of infection significantly reduced SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid). Multiple bacterial taxa were affected by stressor exposure, with the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; being significantly reduced and directly correlated with propionic acid. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; abundances were inversely correlated with colonic inflammation, supporting the contention that &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; helps to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses.

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Higaki, Masashi Muramatsu, Akio Matsuda, Kenji Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Satoh, Makoto Michikawa, Shumpei Niida&lt;/p&gt;

Layland, David Sancho, Clarissa Prazeres da Costa, Martin Giera, Maria Yazdanbakhsh, Bart Everts&lt;/p&gt;
The molecular mechanisms through which dendritic cells (DCs) prime T helper 2 (Th2) responses, including those elicited by parasitic helminths, remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that soluble egg antigen (SEA) from &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, which is well known to drive potent Th2 responses, triggers DCs to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which subsequently—in an autocrine manner—induces OX40 ligand (OX40L) expression to license these DCs to drive Th2 responses. Mechanistically, SEA was found to promote PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis through Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, and via a downstream signaling cascade involving spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2). In addition, this pathway was activated independently of the actions of omega-1 (ω-1), a previously described Th2-priming glycoprotein present in SEA. These findings were supported by in vivo murine data showing that ω-1–independent Th2 priming by SEA was mediated by Dectin-2 and Syk signaling in DCs. Finally, we found that Dectin-2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;, and to a lesser extent Dectin-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, displayed impaired Th2 responses and reduced egg-driven granuloma formation following &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; infection, highlighting the physiological importance of this pathway in Th2 polarization during a helminth infection. In summary, we identified a novel pathway in DCs involving Dectin-1/2-Syk-PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OX40L through which Th2 immune responses are induced.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JxCwEstI3Wg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria M.

&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a parasitic protist possessing a limited set of proteins involved in the autophagy pathway, a self-degradative machinery for protein and organelle recycling. This distant eukaryote has even repurposed part of this machinery, centered on protein ATG8, for a non-degradative function related to the maintenance of the apicoplast, a parasite-specific organelle. However, some evidence also suggest &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; is able to generate autophagic vesicles upon stress, and that some autophagy-related proteins, such as ATG9, might be involved solely in the canonical autophagy function. Here, we have characterised TgPROP1 and TgPROP2, two &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; proteins containing WD-40 repeat that can bind lipids for their recruitment to vesicular structures upon stress. They belong to the PROPPIN family and are homologues to ATG18/WIPI, which are known to be important for the autophagic process. We conducted a functional analysis of these two &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; PROPPINs. One of them is dispensable for normal &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth, although it may play a role for parasite survival in specific stress conditions or for parasite fitness in the host, through a canonical autophagy-related function. The other, however, seems important for parasite viability in normal growth conditions and could be primarily involved in a non-canonical function. These divergent roles for two proteins from the same family illustrate the functional versatility of the autophagy-related machinery in &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195921</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hoa Mai Nguyen, Shuxian Liu, Wassim Daher, Feng Tan, Sébastien Besteiro&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The molecular characterization of endometrial cancer (EC) can facilitate identification of various tumor subtypes. Although EC patients with &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations reproducibly demonstrate better prognosis, the outcome of patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) remains controversial. This study attempted to interrogate whether genetic stratification of EC can identify distinct subsets with prognostic significance.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A cohort of 138 EC patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent was enrolled. Sanger sequencing was used to evaluate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; genes.

Background &lt;p&gt;The molecular characterization of endometrial cancer (EC) can facilitate identification of various tumor subtypes. Although EC patients with &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; mutations reproducibly demonstrate better prognosis, the outcome of patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) remains controversial. This study attempted to interrogate whether genetic stratification of EC can identify distinct subsets with prognostic significance.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A cohort of 138 EC patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent was enrolled. Sanger sequencing was used to evaluate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;POLE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; genes. MSI analysis was performed using four mononucleotide repeat markers and methylation status of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was measured by a fluorescent bisulfite polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Protein expression for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Extensive hypermethylation of the &lt;i&gt;MLH1&lt;/i&gt; promoter was observed in 69.6% ECs with MLH1 deficiency and 3.5% with MMR proficiency, but in none of the ECs with loss of other MMR genes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .0001).

Complex innovations– ideas, practices, and technologies that hold uncertain benefits for potential adopters—often vary in their ability to diffuse in different communities over time. To explain why, I develop a model of innovation adoption in which agents engage in naïve (DeGroot) learning about the value of an innovation within their social networks. Using simulations on Bernoulli random graphs, I examine how adoption varies with network properties and with the distribution of initial opinions and adoption thresholds. The results show that: (i) low-density and high-asymmetry networks produce polarization in influence to adopt an innovation over time, (ii) increasing network density and asymmetry promote adoption under a variety of opinion and threshold distributions, and (iii) the optimal levels of density and asymmetry in networks depend on the distribution of thresholds: networks with high density (&gt;0.25) and high asymmetry (&gt;0.50) are optimal for maximizing diffusion when adoption thresholds are right-skewed (i.e., barriers to adoption are low), but networks with low density (&amp;lt;0.01) and low asymmetry (&amp;lt;0.25) are optimal when thresholds are left-skewed. I draw on data from a diffusion field experiment to predict adoption over time and compare the results to observed outcomes.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196699</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Prediction of disease burden in China arising from smoking based on earlier cohorts in the West and China could not reflect the disease burden at the current stage accurately. No cohort studies in China focused specifically on people born since 1950. We examined the risk of all-cause mortality attributed to smoking in adults in Guangzhou, the city with the most rapidly expanding economy in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;This population-based prospective cohort included 21,658 women and 8,284 men aged 50+ years enrolled from 2003–2008 and followed until January 2016. During an average follow-up of 8.8 (standard deviation = 1.8) years, 2,986 (1,586 women, 1,400 men) deaths were recorded. After adjustment for confounders, the hazards ratios (95% confidence interval (CI)) of all-cause mortality in current versus never smokers increased from 1.61 (95% CI 1.45–1.80) in those born in 1920–1939 to 2.02 (95% CI 1.74–2.34), and 4.40 (95% CI 3.14–6.17), in those born in the 1940s and 1950s, respectively (P for trend 0.009).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In smokers born after 1949 in Guangzhou and other areas which have the longest history of smoking, the mortality risk could have reached three fold that of non-smokers, as in the UK, US and Australia. If confirmed, unless China quickly and strictly complies with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control with massive smoking cessation in the population, this is a more striking warning that China will be facing an even larger disease burden from tobacco use than previous forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196610</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tai Hing Lam, Lin Xu, Chao Qiang Jiang, Wei Sen Zhang, Feng Zhu, Ya Li Jin, G.

Background &lt;p&gt;In airway epithelium, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22) are induced by defective epithelial barriers such as E-cadherin and attract the effector cells of Th2 immunity. However, the association between the epithelial barrier and CCL17 expression has not been studied in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CCL17 and its regulation by Th cytokines in nasal polyp (NP) epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The expression and distribution of CCL17, CCL22, E-cadherin and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were measured using real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry and compared between normal ethmoid sinus epithelium and NP epithelium. In addition, the expression level of CCL17 was determined in cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The expression of CCL17 was decreased in the NP epithelium compared to the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus, whereas the expression of CCL22 was not decreased. E-cadherin was differentially distributed between the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus and NP epithelium. EGFR was also decreased in NPs. Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197355</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byoungjae Kim, Hyun-Ji Lee, Nu-Ri Im, Doh Young Lee, Ha Kyun Kim, Cha Young Kang, Il-Ho Park, Seung Hoon Lee, Heung-Man Lee, Sang Hag Lee, Seung-Kuk Baek, Tae Hoon Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04053-7</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04053-7</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162f6f79258:67153f2:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>De novo main-chain modeling for EM maps using MAINMAST</title><crawled>1524561842776</crawled><published>1524553200000</published><fingerprint>ec0bcae7</fingerprint><author><name>Genki Terashi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;De novo main-chain modeling for EM maps using MAINMAST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De novo main-chain modeling for EM maps using MAINMAST, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04053-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04053-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Main-chain tracing remains a time-consuming task for medium resolution cryo-EM maps.

Bittersweet (&lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&lt;/i&gt;) is a native Old World member of the nightshade family. This European diploid species can be found from marshlands to high mountainous regions and it is a common weed that serves as an alternative host and source of resistance genes against plant pathogens such as late blight (&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt;). We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of bittersweet, which is 155,580 bp in length and it is characterized by a typical quadripartite structure composed of a large (85,901 bp) and small (18,449 bp) single-copy region interspersed by two identical inverted repeats (25,615 bp). It consists of 112 unique genes from which 81 are protein-coding, 27 tRNA and four rRNA genes. All bittersweet plastid genes including non-functional ones and even intergenic spacer regions are transcribed in primary plastid transcripts covering 95.22% of the genome. These are later substantially edited in a post-transcriptional phase to activate gene functions. By comparing the bittersweet plastid genome with all available Solanaceae sequences we found that gene content and synteny are highly conserved across the family. During genome comparison we have identified several annotation errors, which we have corrected in a manual curation process then we have identified the major plastid genome structural changes in Solanaceae. Interpreted in a phylogenetic context they seem to provide additional support for larger clades. The plastid genome sequence of bittersweet could help to benchmark Solanaceae plastid genome annotations and could be used as a reference for further studies. Such reliable annotations are important for gene diversity calculations, synteny map constructions and assigning partitions for phylogenetic analysis with de novo sequenced plastomes of Solanaceae.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196069</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Amiryousefi, Jaakko Hyvönen, Péter Poczai&lt;/p&gt;

Jasmonates (JAs) are signalling molecules involved in stress responses, development and secondary metabolism biosynthesis, although their roles in fleshy-fruit development and ripening processes are not well known. In strawberry fruit, it has been proposed that JAs could regulate the early development through the activation of the JAs biosynthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that JA treatment increases anthocyanin content in strawberry fruit involving the bioactive jasmonate biosynthesis. Nevertheless, JA signalling pathway, of which main components are the COI1-JAZ co-receptor and the MYC transcription factors (TFs), has not been characterized in strawberry until now. Here we identified and characterized the woodland strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;) JAZ and MYC genes as well as studied their expression during development and ripening stages in commercial strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;) fruit. We described twelve putative JAZ proteins and two MYC TFs, which showed high conservation with respect to their orthologs in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and in other fleshy-fruit species such as &lt;i&gt;Malus&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;domestica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by gene synteny and phylogenetic analyses. Noteworthy, their expression levels exhibited a significant decrease from fruit development to ripening stages in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;, along with others of the JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaNINJA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FaJAM&lt;/i&gt;s, encoding for negative regulators of JA responses. Moreover, we found that main JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaMYC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;FaJAZ1&lt;/i&gt; are promptly induced by JA treatment at early times in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit.

The aim of this study was to evaluate in the Wistar rat the efficacy of various autologous nerve conduits with various forms of blood supply in reconstructing a 10-mm-long gap in the median nerve (MN) under conditions of local ischemia. A 10-mm-long median nerve defect was created in the right arm. A loose silicone tube was placed around the nerve gap zone, in order to simulate a local ischemic environment. Rats were divided in the following experimental groups (each with 20 rats): the nerve Graft (NG) group, in which the excised MN segment was reattached; the conventional nerve flap (CNF) and the arterialized neurovenous flap (ANVF) groups in which the gap was bridged with homonymous median nerve flaps; the prefabricated nerve flap (PNF) group in which the gap was reconstructed with a fabricated flap created by leaving an arteriovenous fistula in contact with the sciatic nerve for 5 weeks; and the two control groups, Sham and Excision groups. In the latter group, the proximal stump of the MN nerve was ligated and no repair was performed. The rats were followed for 100 days. During this time, they did physiotherapy. Functional, electroneuromyographic and histological studies were performed. The CNF and ANVF groups presented better results than the NG group in the following assessments: grasping test, nociception, motor stimulation threshold, muscle weight, and histomorphometric evaluation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate in the Wistar rat the efficacy of various autologous nerve conduits with various forms of blood supply in reconstructing a 10-mm-long gap in the median nerve (MN) under conditions of local ischemia. A 10-mm-long median nerve defect was created in the right arm. A loose silicone tube was placed around the nerve gap zone, in order to simulate a local ischemic environment. Rats were divided in the following experimental groups (each with 20 rats): the nerve Graft (NG) group, in which the excised MN segment was reattached; the conventional nerve flap (CNF) and the arterialized neurovenous flap (ANVF) groups in which the gap was bridged with homonymous median nerve flaps; the prefabricated nerve flap (PNF) group in which the gap was reconstructed with a fabricated flap created by leaving an arteriovenous fistula in contact with the sciatic nerve for 5 weeks; and the two control groups, Sham and Excision groups. In the latter group, the proximal stump of the MN nerve was ligated and no repair was performed. The rats were followed for 100 days. During this time, they did physiotherapy. Functional, electroneuromyographic and histological studies were performed. The CNF and ANVF groups presented better results than the NG group in the following assessments: grasping test, nociception, motor stimulation threshold, muscle weight, and histomorphometric evaluation. Radial deviation of the operated forepaw was more common in rats that presented worse results in the other outcome variables. Overall, CNFs and ANVFs produced a faster and more complete recovery than NGs in the reconstruction of a 10-mm-long median nerve gap in an ischemic environment in the Wistar rat. Although, results obtained with CNFs were in most cases were better than ANVFs, these differences were not statistically significant for most of the outcome variables.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/25/308379</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308379v1?rss=1</originId><engagement>12</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308379v1?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162fe478310:679e8b:91749e5b</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Quantifying multi-layered expression regulation in response to stress of the endoplasmic reticulum [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1524684522256</crawled><published>1524639600000</published><fingerprint>a35d7d15</fingerprint><author><name>Rendleman, J.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The mammalian response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress dynamically affects all layers of gene expression regulation.

The Wiener polarity number (which, nowadays, known as the Wiener polarity index and usually denoted by &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) was devised by the chemist Harold Wiener, for predicting the boiling points of alkanes. The index &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; of chemical trees (chemical graphs representing alkanes) is defined as the number of unordered pairs of vertices (carbon atoms) at distance 3. The inverse problems based on some well-known topological indices have already been addressed in the literature. The solution of such inverse problems may be helpful in speeding up the discovery of lead compounds having the desired properties.

Background &lt;p&gt;Frequent changes in the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) occurring worldwide demand regular surveillance to study their composition and distribution in healthcare facilities. We investigated the genotypic characteristics of MRSA obtained in Kuwait hospitals to better understand their clonal distribution.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,327 MRSA isolates obtained from clinical samples in 13 Kuwait hospitals from 1 January to 31 December 2016 were investigated using antibiogram, SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; typing, spa typing and DNA microarray.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The isolates belonged to six SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; types with the majority belonging to type IV (658; 49.5%) and type V (355; 26.7%). Two hundred and sixty-one spa types were identified with spa types t688, t304, t860, t127, t044, t311, t002, t223, t267, t019, t3841, t005, t084, t852, and t657 constituting 51.0% (n = 677) of the isolates. Among the 1,327 MRSA isolates, 102 (7.68%) isolates were identified as novel variants of internationally recognized MRSA clones. These 102 isolates were investigated further and belonged to 14 clonal complexes (CCs) with CC361 (32; 32.3%), CC30 (15; 14.7%), CC22 (13; 12.7%) and CC1 (11, 10.7%) as the dominant CCs. Eighty-one (79.4%) of the novel isolates harbored SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; IV or V+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt; composite genetic elements. Four isolates (3.9%) harbored unusual combinations of &lt;i&gt;ccr&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; complexes comprising of CC6-MRSA [IV+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrC&lt;/i&gt;], CC97-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB2&lt;/i&gt;], CC121-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrB4&lt;/i&gt;] and CC1-MRSA-pseudoSCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; [class B mec+&lt;i&gt;fusc&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB1&lt;/i&gt;]. Forty-six (45.1%) of these isolates were positive for PVL and 89 (87.2%) were resistant to fusidic acid mediated by &lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The study showed the emergence of novel variants of previously recognized MRSA genotypes with unusual genetic characteristics including high prevalence of PVL and fusidic acid resistance in Kuwait hospitals.

This has added to the dynamic lists of known variations in MRSA genomes which can impose serious challenges for infection control and treatment of MRSA infections.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02296</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02296</link><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_16301e3b1db:87b3bb:a96d255</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>[ASAP] pH-Induced Rotation of Lidless Lipase LipA from Bacillus subtilis at Lipase–Detergent Interface</title><crawled>1524745089499</crawled><published>1524715200000</published><fingerprint>fa9e319d</fingerprint><author><name>Sudip Das, Sundaram Balasubramanian</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02296/20180426/images/medium/jp-2018-022966_0012.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02296&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Kromer, Steffen Märcker, Steffen Lange, Christel Baier, Benjamin M. Friedrich&lt;/p&gt;
To navigate their surroundings, cells rely on sensory input that is corrupted by noise. In cells performing chemotaxis, such noise arises from the stochastic binding of signalling molecules at low chemoattractant concentrations. We reveal a fundamental relationship between the speed of chemotactic steering and the strength of directional fluctuations that result from the amplification of noise in a chemical input signal. This relation implies a trade-off between steering that is slow and reliable, and steering that is fast but less reliable. We show that dynamic switching between these two modes of steering can substantially increase the probability to find a target, such as an egg to be found by sperm cells. This decision making confers no advantage in the absence of noise, but is beneficial when chemical signals are detectable, yet characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios. The latter applies at intermediate distances from a target, where signalling molecules are diluted, thus defining a ‘noise zone’ that cells have to cross. Our results explain decision making observed in recent experiments on sea urchin sperm chemotaxis. More generally, our theory demonstrates how decision making enables chemotactic agents to cope with high levels of noise in gradient sensing by dynamically adjusting the persistence length of a biased random walk.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0k29V7Enzbw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Justus A.

First, we applied a hierarchical cluster analysis and the principal component analysis (PCA) to a panel of questionnaires [comorbidity (Charlson, CIRS), clinical stability (MEWS), social frailty (Flugelman), cognitive dysfunction (SPSMQ), depression (5-item GDS), functional dependence (ADL, IADL, Barthel), risk of sore threats (Exton-Smith scale), nutrition (MNA), pain (NRPS), adherence to therapy (Morisky scale)], in order to select domains informative for the definition of complexity. The following step was to create the score(s) needed to quantify it.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Two main clusters were identified: the first includes 7 questionnaires whose common denominator is dependence and frailty, the second consists of 3 questionnaires representative of comorbidity. Globally, they account for about 70% of the total variance (55.2% and 13.8%, respectively). The first principal component was simplified in “Complimed Score 1” (CS1) as a recalibrated average between the Barthel Index and the Exton Smith score, whereas the second cluster was approximated to “Complimed Score 2” (CS2), by using the Charlson score only.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Complexity is a two-dimensional clinical phenomenon. The FADOI-Complimed Score(s) is a new tool useful for the routine evaluation of complexity in medical patients, simple to use and taking around 10 minutes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195805</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erminio Bonizzoni, Gualberto Gussoni, Giancarlo Agnelli, Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi, Moira Bonfanti, Franco Mastroianni, Marco Candela, Carlotta Franchi, Stefania Frasson, Antonio Greco, Micaela La Regina, Roberta Re, Giorgio Vescovo, Mauro Campanini&lt;/p&gt;

Our results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralised mammalian clock, the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; clock has multiple coordination points.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196624</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196624</originId><updated>1524603600000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196624</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fbe:34f43e70</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Correction: Sinking towards destiny: High throughput measurement of phytoplankton sinking rates through time-resolved fluorescence plate spectroscopy</title><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><published>1524603600000</published><fingerprint>c578c3f4</fingerprint><author><name>Catherine C.

Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated information (Φ), and showing that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible &lt;i&gt;black boxes&lt;/i&gt;. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nmwWC-o9ix4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Giulio Tononi&lt;/p&gt;

The biological impetus for gene dosage and allele specificity of mammalian imprinted genes is not fully understood. To address this, we generated and analyzed four sets of mice from a single breeding scheme with varying allelic expression and gene dosage of the &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; domain. The mutants with abrogation of the two paternally expressed genes, &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt;, showed a significant decrease in growth rates for both males and females, while the mutants with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an increased growth rate of female mice only. The mutant cohort with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; tended to have greater numbers of pups compared to the other genotypes.

= 0.26 kcal/mol) associated with electron transfer in Be2B36Li21 and Be2B36 species confirm that boron rich species have potential abilities to be used in the Li‐based battery. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/06/315622</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315622v1?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315622v1?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1633758f97c:24cf94f:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Detecting differential transcription factor activity from ATAC-seq data [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1525641967996</crawled><published>1525590000000</published><fingerprint>81e09591</fingerprint><author><name>Tripodi, I.

The identification of germplasm resources is an important aspect of sugarcane breeding. The aim of this study was to introduce a new method for identifying &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny. First, we cloned and sequenced nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrDNA-ITS) sequences from 20 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms. Analysis of these nrDNA-ITS sequences showed a stable mutation at base 89. Primers (FO13, RO13, FI16, and RI16) were then designed for tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR based on mutations at base 89 of the nrDNA-ITS sequence. An additional 71 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms were identified using this tetra-primer ARMS PCR method, which confirmed that the method using the described primers successfully identified &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and progeny. These results may help improve the efficiency of modern molecular breeding of sugarcane and lay a foundation for identification of sugarcane germplasms and the relationships among them.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197458</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shan Yang, Xueting Li, Fei Huang, Yongji Huang, Xinlong Liu, Jiayun Wu, Qinnan Wang, Zuhu Deng, Rukai Chen, Muqing Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; HP0377 is a thiol oxidoreductase, a member of the CcmG family involved in cytochrome biogenesis, as previously shown by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments.

WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence. This peptide exhibits micromolar affinity towards WHSC1 in biochemical and biophysical assays. Furthermore, a crystal structure was solved with the peptide in complex with SAM and the SET domain of WHSC1L1. This inhibitor is an important first step in creating potent, selective WHSC1 tool compounds for the purposes of understanding the complex biology in relation to human disease.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197082</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael J.

There is evidence that altering stress mindset—the belief that stress is enhancing vs. debilitating—can change cognitive, affective and physiological responses to stress. However individual differences in responsiveness to stress mindset manipulations have not been explored. Given the previously established role of catecholamines in both placebo effects and stress, we hypothesized that genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines, would moderate responses to an intervention intended to alter participants’ mindsets about stress. Participants (N = 107) were exposed to a stress mindset manipulation (videos highlighting either the enhancing or debilitating effects of stress) prior to engaging in a Trier Social Stress task and subsequent cognitive tasks. The associations of the &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; rs4680 polymorphism with the effect of stress mindset video manipulations on cognitive and affective responses were examined. Genetic variation at rs4680 modified the effects of stress mindset on affective and cognitive responses to stress. Individuals homozygous for rs4680 low-activity allele (met/met) were responsive to the stress-is-enhancing mindset manipulation as indicated by greater increases in positive affect, improved cognitive functioning, and happiness bias in response to stress. Conversely, individuals homozygous for the high-activity allele (val/val) were not as responsive to the stress mindset manipulation. These results suggest that responses to stress mindset intervention may vary with &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype. These findings contribute to the understanding of gene by environment interactions for mindset interventions and stress reactivity and therefore warrant further investigations.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195883</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alia J.

The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;.

The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains.

and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;, which quickly introduce suspended animation in response to oxygen depletion to survive long-term anoxia.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023403?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023403?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d1d:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><title>Phase separation and large deviations of lattice active matter</title><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><published>1524229151000</published><fingerprint>a3f013fe</fingerprint><author><name>Stephen Whitelam</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023403?af=R</href></item></alternate><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25423-7</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25423-7</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163041f3502:59748c:11c251fd</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Author Correction: Diversity and evolution of sex determination systems in terrestrial isopods</title><crawled>1524782544130</crawled><published>1524812400000</published><fingerprint>976c9624</fingerprint><author><name>Thomas Becking</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Diversity and evolution of sex determination systems in terrestrial isopods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Diversity and evolution of sex determination systems in terrestrial isopods, Published online: 27 April 2018;

Background and objective &lt;p&gt;Potential hepatoxicity is an important clinical concern when administering immunosuppressive therapies to patients infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) increase the likelihood of hepatitis consequent to HBV reactivation, but reported risks and outcomes vary. We determined the risks of liver enzyme elevation in anti-rheumatic drug users from an HBV-endemic region with differing HBV serostatus.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We established retrospective cohorts with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis who: 1) received anti-TNF agents from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2013; 2) received care from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2013 but only ever used conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Serology results defined three subgroups: HBV surface antigen positive (HBsAg+), HBsAg negative/HBV core antibody positive (HBsAg−/HBcAb+), or uninfected. We compared incidences of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) exceeding twice the upper reference limit between HBV serostatus subgroups in each treatment cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 783 patients treated with anti-TNF (n = 472) or DMARDs only (n = 311), HBsAg−/HBcAb+ anti-TNF users had incidence of ALT elevation commensurate with uninfected counterparts (6.1 vs. 6.0/100 person-years), compared to 19.6/100 person-years in HBsAg+ patients (standardized rate ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–8.2); none effected had severe or fatal hepatitis and ALT levels in all HBsAg−/HBcAb+ patients remained stable, mostly normalizing spontaneously, or after moderating treatment.

The analysis of genomic data (~400,000 autosomal SNPs) enabled the reliable estimation of inbreeding levels in a sample of 541 individuals sampled from a highly admixed Brazilian population isolate (an African-derived &lt;i&gt;quilombo&lt;/i&gt; in the State of São Paulo). To achieve this, different methods were applied to the joint information of two sets of markers (one complete and another excluding loci in patent linkage disequilibrium). This strategy allowed the detection and exclusion of markers that biased the estimation of the average population inbreeding coefficient (Wright’s fixation index &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt;), which value was eventually estimated as around 1% using any of the methods we applied. &lt;i&gt;Quilombo&lt;/i&gt; demographic inferences were made by analyzing the structure of runs of homozygosity (ROH), which were adapted to cope with a highly admixed population with a complex foundation history. Our results suggest that the amount of ROH &amp;lt;2Mb of admixed populations should be somehow proportional to the genetic contribution from each parental population.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196360</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Renan B.

To achieve this, different methods were applied to the joint information of two sets of markers (one complete and another excluding loci in patent linkage disequilibrium). This strategy allowed the detection and exclusion of markers that biased the estimation of the average population inbreeding coefficient (Wright’s fixation index &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt;), which value was eventually estimated as around 1% using any of the methods we applied. &lt;i&gt;Quilombo&lt;/i&gt; demographic inferences were made by analyzing the structure of runs of homozygosity (ROH), which were adapted to cope with a highly admixed population with a complex foundation history. Our results suggest that the amount of ROH &amp;lt;2Mb of admixed populations should be somehow proportional to the genetic contribution from each parental population.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03907-4</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03907-4</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1631b03fc98:2393e69:4e164c41</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Non-canonical activation of DAPK2 by AMPK constitutes a new pathway linking metabolic stress to autophagy</title><crawled>1525166636184</crawled><published>1525158000000</published><fingerprint>5a15dbe2</fingerprint><author><name>Ruth Shiloh</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-canonical activation of DAPK2 by AMPK constitutes a new pathway linking metabolic stress to autophagy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-canonical activation of DAPK2 by AMPK constitutes a new pathway linking metabolic stress to autophagy, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03907-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03907-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;DAPK2 is a calmodulin-regulated protein kinase implicated in autophagy regulation, but how physiological stress leads to its activation is yet unknown.

The macaque is widely accepted as a suitable model for preclinical characterization of dengue vaccine candidates. However, the only vaccine for which both preclinical and clinical efficacy results were reported so far showed efficacy levels that were substantially different between macaques and humans. We hypothesized that this model’s predictive capacity may be improved using recent and minimally passaged dengue virus isolates, and by assessing vaccine efficacy by characterizing not only the post-dengue virus challenge viremia/RNAemia but also the associated-cytokine profile. Ten recent and minimally passaged Brazilian clinical isolates from the four dengue virus serotypes were tested for their infectivity in rhesus macaques. For the strains showing robust replication capacity, the associated-changes in soluble mediator levels, and the elicited dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses, were also characterized. Three isolates from dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 4 induced viremia of high magnitude and longer duration relative to previously reported viremia kinetics in this model, and robust dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses. Consistent with observations in humans, increased MCP-1, IFN-γ and VEGF-A levels, and transiently decreased IL-8 levels were detected after infection with the selected isolates. These results may contribute to establishing a dengue macaque model showing a higher predictability for vaccine efficacy in humans.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196311</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Beatriz Borges, Renato Sergio Marchevsky, Ygara S.

The Tasmanian devil (&lt;i&gt;Sarcophilus harrisii)&lt;/i&gt;, the largest extant carnivorous marsupial and endemic to Tasmania, is at the verge of extinction due to the emergence of a transmissible cancer known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). DFTD has spread over the distribution range of the species and has been responsible for a severe decline in the global devil population. To protect the Tasmanian devil from extinction in the wild, our group has focused on the development of a prophylactic vaccine. Although this work has shown that vaccine preparations using whole DFTD tumour cells supplemented with adjuvants can induce anti-DFTD immune responses, alternative strategies that induce stronger and more specific immune responses are required. In humans, heat shock proteins (HSPs) derived from tumour cells have been used instead of whole-tumour cell preparations as a source of antigens for cancer immunotherapy. As HSPs have not been studied in the Tasmanian devil, this study presents the first characterisation of HSPs in this marsupial and evaluates the suitability of these proteins as antigenic components for the enhancement of a DFTD vaccine. We show that tissues and cancer cells from the Tasmanian devil express constitutive and inducible HSP. Additionally, this study suggests that HSP derived from DFTD cancer cells are immunogenic supporting the future development of a HSP-based vaccine against DFTD.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cesar Tovar, Amanda L.

Additionally, this study suggests that HSP derived from DFTD cancer cells are immunogenic supporting the future development of a HSP-based vaccine against DFTD.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196354</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196354</originId><updated>1524171600000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196354</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f790a:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Correction: High &amp;lt;i&gt;ECT2&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression is an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival in non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma</title><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><published>1524171600000</published><fingerprint>439a9126</fingerprint><author><name>Shijie Zhou</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shijie Zhou, Ping Wang, Xiaolan Su, Jingxia Chen, Hongfen Chen, Hanbing Yang, Aiping Fang, Linshen Xie, Yuqin Yao, Jinliang Yang&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196354</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shijie Zhou, Ping Wang, Xiaolan Su, Jingxia Chen, Hongfen Chen, Hanbing Yang, Aiping Fang, Linshen Xie, Yuqin Yao, Jinliang Yang&lt;/p&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04025-x</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04025-x</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162dd3ac8e6:413265d:34f43e70</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Gene refashioning through innovative shifting of reading frames in mosses</title><crawled>1524130040038</crawled><published>1524121200000</published><fingerprint>4352cedf</fingerprint><author><name>Yanlong Guan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gene refashioning through innovative shifting of reading frames in mosses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene refashioning through innovative shifting of reading frames in mosses, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04025-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04025-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Extant representatives of the earliest land plant lineages adapt to various terrestrial habitats with structural and physiological innovations.

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, can elude hosts’ innate and adaptive immunity as part of the course of infection. The ability of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; to invade or be internalized by host cells in vitro has been proposed as a mechanism for the pathogen to evade immune responses or antimicrobials. We have previously shown that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; can be internalized by human neuroglial cells. In this study we demonstrate that these cells take up &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; via coiling phagocytosis mediated by the formin, Daam1, a process similarly described for human macrophages. Following coincubation with glial cells, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was enwrapped by Daam1-enriched coiling pseudopods. Coiling of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was significantly reduced when neuroglial cells were pretreated with anti-Daam1 antibody indicating the requirement for Daam1 for borrelial phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy showed Daam1 colocalizing to the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface suggesting interaction with borrelial membrane protein(s). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system for identifying protein-protein binding, we found that the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface lipoprotein, BBA66, bound the FH2 subunit domain of Daam1. Recombinant proteins were used to validate binding by ELISA, pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence for native Daam1 and BBA66 interaction was suggested by colocalization of the proteins in the course of borrelial capture by the Daam1-enriched pseudopodia. Additionally, we found a striking reduction in coiling for a BBA66-deficient mutant strain compared to BBA66-expressing strains. These results show that coiling phagocytosis is a mechanism for borrelial internalization by neuroglial cells mediated by Daam1.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197413</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shanna K.

Age estimation methods based on hard structures require a process of validation to confirm the periodical pattern of growth marks. Among such processes, one of the most used is the marginal increment ratio (MIR), which was stated to follow a sinusoidal cycle in a population. Despite its utility, in most cases, its implementation has lacked robust statistical analysis. Accordingly, we propose a modeling approach for the temporal periodicity of growth increments based on single and second order harmonic functions. For illustrative purposes, the MIR periodicities for two geoduck species (&lt;i&gt;Panopea generosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Panopea globosa&lt;/i&gt;) were modeled to identify the periodical pattern of growth increments in the shell. This model identified an annual periodicity for both species but described different temporal patterns. The proposed procedure can be broadly used to objectively define the timing of the peak, the degree of symmetry, and therefore, the synchrony of band deposition of different species on the basis of MIR data.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196189</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by José Angel Hidalgo-de-la-Toba, Enrique Morales-Bojórquez, Sergio Scarry González-Peláez, J.

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aims of the study were to identify the associations between multimorbidity and specific physical function domains among community-dwelling adults in Singapore, and to examine sex differences in the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted using baseline data of 1,940 participants in the Population Health Index Survey conducted in the Central Region of Singapore from November 2015 to November 2016. Physical function was assessed using the Function Component of the Late-life Function and Disability Instrument and compared between men and women. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine associations between multimorbidity and different physical function domains for all participants, and in men and women separately.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of multimorbidity in the study population was 35.0% for adults aged 21 years and above, with no differences between men and women. Multimorbidity was associated with reduced upper extremity function, basic and advanced lower extremity function, and overall function in men and women after adjusting for demographic factors. Multimorbidity had a stronger association with advanced lower extremity function and overall physical function in women than in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings of this study indicate that multimorbidity is associated with physical function domains in men and women, and in particular advanced lower extremity for women. Effective community-based interventions need to be implemented to preserve physical function in individuals with multimorbidity to keep them functionally independent and physically active in the community. Additional focus on advanced lower extremity function for women is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197443</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lixia Ge, Chun Wei Yap, Bee Hoon Heng&lt;/p&gt;

Sixty-four underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy (VATS), including 53 multi-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (MITS), and 11 single-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (SITS). Thirty-nine were converted to thoracotomy. The intended thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and hospital stay (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) than the VATS group although the VATS group had higher grade of cavity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007). The intended thoracotomy group did not differ from converted thoracotomy in operative time, blood loss, or hospital stay, and the grade of pleural thickening was higher in the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001).

To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and Large White sows (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In addition, the serological concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were not significantly different between the two breeds at the 3rd week postpartum. However, these indicators were significantly different at the 5th week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.000, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, respectively). The SIgA concentrations in saliva were significantly different between breeds at the 3rd week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In conclusion, both breeds of sows maybe in a state of stress after the 4th week postpartum. However, the Damin sows may be better than the Large White sows in terms of adapting to this farrowing environment.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197152</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Honggui Liu, Ran Yi, Chao Wang, Peng Zhao, Mingyue Zhang, Shiwen Xu, Jun Bao&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.44; p&amp;lt;0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45–5.62; p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals.

We show that RSV infection up-regulated hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase expression and increased PGD2 release by cultured human primary airway epithelial cells (AECs). Moreover, PGD2 production was elevated in nasopharyngeal samples from young infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis compared to healthy controls. In a neonatal mouse model of severe viral bronchiolitis, DP2 antagonism decreased viral load, immunopathology, and morbidity and ablated the predisposition for subsequent asthma onset in later life. This protective response was abolished upon dual DP1/DP2 antagonism and replicated with a specific DP1 agonist. Rather than mediating an effect via type 2 inflammation, the beneficial effects of DP2 blockade or DP1 agonism were associated with increased interferon- (IFN-) [interleukin-28A/B (IL-28A/B)] expression and were lost upon IL-28A neutralization. In RSV-infected AEC cultures, DP1 activation up-regulated IFN- production, which, in turn, increased IFN-stimulated gene expression, accelerating viral clearance.

Few studies have estimated the economic burden of chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers) attributable to unhealthy eating. In this study, we estimated the economic burden of chronic disease attributable to not meeting Canadian food recommendations. We first obtained chronic disease risk estimates for intakes of both protective (1. vegetables; 2. fruit; 3. whole grains; 4. milk; 5. nuts and seeds) and harmful (6. processed meat; 7. red meat; 8. sugar-sweetened beverages) foods from the Global Burden of Disease Study, and food intakes from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey 24-hour dietary recalls (n = 33,932 respondents). We then calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) for all relevant food-chronic disease combinations by age and sex groups. These PAFs were then mathematically combined for each disease for each age and sex group. We then estimated attributable costs by multiplying these combined PAFs with estimated 2014 annual direct health care (hospital, drug, physician) and indirect (human capital approach) costs for each disease. We found that not meeting recommendations for the eight foods was responsible for CAD$13.8 billion/year (direct health care: CAD$5.1 billion, indirect: CAD$8.7 billion). Nuts and seeds and whole grains were the top cost contributors rather than vegetables and fruit. Our findings suggest that unhealthy eating constitutes a tremendous economic burden to Canada that is similar in magnitude to the burden of smoking and larger than that of physical inactivity which were estimated using similar approaches. A status quo in promotion of healthy eating will allow this burden to continue. Interventions to reduce the health and economic burden of unhealthy eating in Canada may be more effective if they are broad in focus and include promotion of nuts and seeds and whole grains along with vegetables and fruit rather than have a narrow focus such as primarily on vegetables and fruit.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196333</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica R.

Despite these achievements, they still suffer from important issues that must be solved to allow further improving their performances and utilizing them to deepen our insights into protein folding and stability mechanisms. One of these problems is their bias towards the learning datasets which, being dominated by destabilizing mutations, causes predictions to be better for destabilizing than for stabilizing mutations. We thoroughly analyzed the biases in the prediction of folding free energy changes upon point mutations ({Delta}{Delta}G0) and proposed some unbiased solutions. We started by constructing a dataset Ssym of experimentally measured {Delta}{Delta}G0s with an equal number of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, by collecting mutations for which the structure of both the wild type and mutant protein is available.

Despite these achievements, they still suffer from important issues that must be solved to allow further improving their performances and utilizing them to deepen our insights into protein folding and stability mechanisms. One of these problems is their bias towards the learning datasets which, being dominated by destabilizing mutations, causes predictions to be better for destabilizing than for stabilizing mutations. We thoroughly analyzed the biases in the prediction of folding free energy changes upon point mutations ({Delta}{Delta}G0) and proposed some unbiased solutions.

We previously identified brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a source of sleep-inducing signals. Pharmacological activation of BAT enhances sleep while sleep loss leads to increased BAT thermogenesis. Recovery sleep after sleep loss is diminished in mice that lack uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and also in wild-type (WT) mice after sensory denervation of the BAT. Systemic inflammation greatly affects metabolism and the function of adipose tissue, and also induces characteristic sleep responses. We hypothesized that sleep responses to acute inflammation are mediated by BAT-derived signals. To test this, we determined the effects of systemic inflammation on sleep and body temperature in UCP-1 knockout (KO) and WT mice. Intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 beta and clodronate containing liposomes were used to induce systemic inflammation. In WT animals, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) was elevated in all four inflammatory models. All NREMS responses were completely abolished in UCP-1 KO animals. Systemic inflammation elicited an initial hypothermia followed by fever in WT mice. The hypothermic phase, but not the fever, was abolished in UCP-1 KO mice. The only recognized function of UCP-1 is to promote thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Present results indicate that the presence of UCP-1 is necessary for increased NREMS but does not contribute to the development of fever in systemic inflammation.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197409</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Éva Szentirmai, Levente Kapás&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient’s life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (post-treatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48).

Compliance rate was 69% and total dropout rate was 28%, both primarily related to disease progression and death.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;LRT-MST seems effective among cancer patients in palliative care to improve the course of ego-integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002912</originId><updated>1526072400000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002912</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f2:f3bf0074</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl></origin><crawled>1526060694416</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><fingerprint>9a817a3c</fingerprint><title>Hey1- and p53-dependent TrkC proapoptotic activity controls neuroblastoma growth</title><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;
The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with endplate degeneration and the association between cartilaginous fragments and inflammatory response to the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Summary of background data &lt;p&gt;LDH often involves hyaline cartilage fragments pulled from the vertebral endplates. Modic changes are closely associated with LDH that contains hyaline cartilage, and cartilaginous endplates seem to affect resorption of the herniated disc.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 78 patients who underwent microscopic discectomy between 9 and 16 weeks after an occurrence of LDH were reviewed. Modic changes, disc degeneration, high-intensity zone, and vertebral corner defect were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histopathological observations of cartilaginous endplates and inflamed granulation tissue in the herniated disc were made. In cases with inflamed granulation tissue, neovascularization and macrophage infiltration were also evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Modic changes were observed in approximately one-third of the patients (26 cases: type 1, 7; type 2, 17; and type 3, 2). Cartilaginous endplates were observed in 32 cases (41%) and in the majority of cases with Modic changes compared with cases without Modic changes (65%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). Although inflamed granulation tissue was observed in 60 cases (77%), no significant differences were detected in patient age and the composition of the herniated material. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that fewer CD34-positive capillaries and CD68-positive cells were found in cases with cartilaginous fragments compared with those without cartilaginous fragments (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In addition, a higher immunoreactivity to CD34 and CD68 was found in herniated discs &amp;lt;25% of whose area was occupied by cartilaginous endplates compared with discs whose area was occupied at 25% or more (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;There is an association between LDH with endplate degeneration and cartilaginous herniation, with Modic type 2 predominating.

Objective &lt;p&gt;It has been previously demonstrated that T lymphocytes may be involved in the development of hypertension and microvascular remodeling, and that circulating T effector lymphocytes may be increased in hypertension. In particular, Th1 and Th 17 lymphocytes may contribute to the progression of hypertension and microvascular damage while T-regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes seem to be protective in this regard.

Background &lt;p&gt;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are regarded as the cornerstone of conventional treatment for AS. However little is known about concomitant NSAID use during treatment (with TNF-α inhibitors) in daily clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Consecutive patients from the GLAS cohort were included. NSAID use and ASAS-NSAID index were evaluated at group level and at individual patient level during 52 weeks of follow-up. Analyses were stratified for treatment regimen. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to evaluate NSAID use in relation to assessments of disease activity over time. In patients starting TNF-α inhibitors (n = 254), 79% used NSAIDs at baseline and this proportion decreased significantly to 38% at 52 weeks. ASAS-NSAID index also decreased significantly from median 65 to 0. In patients on conventional treatment (n = 139), 74% used NSAIDs at baseline with median ASAS-NSAID index of 50 and this remained stable during follow-up. At each follow-up visit, approximately half of the patients changed their type or dose of NSAIDs. GEE analysis over time showed that NSAID use was associated with AS disease activity score (p&amp;lt;0.05). This relation was more pronounced in patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors compared to conventional treatment (B = 0.825 vs. B = 0.250).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this observational cohort of established AS patients, there was no difference in baseline NSAID use between patients with and without indication for TNF-α inhibitors.

However, NSAID use changed frequently at individual patient level and was significantly associated with disease activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006112</originId><updated>1524862800000</updated><engagement>83</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006112</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16308310122:44e8c:ed160cc3</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><crawled>1524850819362</crawled><published>1524862800000</published><fingerprint>ead87314</fingerprint><title>RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD): A general framework for computational antibody design</title><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jared Adolf-Bryfogle, Oleks Kalyuzhniy, Michael Kubitz, Brian D. Weitzner, Xiaozhen Hu, Yumiko Adachi, William R. Schief, Roland L. Dunbrack Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
A structural-bioinformatics-based computational methodology and framework have been developed for the design of antibodies to targets of interest. RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Mol&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Biol&lt;/i&gt;., 406:228–256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody–antigen complexes, using two design strategies—optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody–antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PVAny09_uEE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jared Adolf-Bryfogle, Oleks Kalyuzhniy, Michael Kubitz, Brian D.

SequencEnG is part of the project KnowEnG (Knowledge Engine for Genomics) and is freely available at http://education.knoweng.org/sequenceng/.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>2.0</engagementRate></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</originId><updated>1525208400000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a71:11c251fd</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Effects of isomaltodextrin in postprandial lipid kinetics: Rat study and human randomized crossover study</title><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><published>1525208400000</published><fingerprint>c77a2e72</fingerprint><author><name>Ryodai Takagaki</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryodai Takagaki, Yuki Ishida, Tsuyoshi Sadakiyo, Yoshifumi Taniguchi, Takeo Sakurai, Hitoshi Mitsuzumi, Hikaru Watanabe, Shigeharu Fukuda, Shimpei Ushio&lt;/p&gt;
Isomaltodextrin (IMD) is a novel dietary fiber-like polysaccharide: a type of α-glucan produced from starch using enzymes derived from microorganisms. The results of cohort studies show that dietary fiber can prevent cardiovascular disorders caused by lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of excess fat absorption by dietary fiber is known to be one of the mechanisms, and it is also known that the actions of dietary fiber vary depending on factors such as its structure or origin. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory actions of IMD on fat absorption, and analyzed its mechanism of action. In rats, the absorption of fat given by gavage was significantly lower at 1, 2, and 6 hours after IMD administration than after vehicle administration. In humans, IMD was associated with a lesser increase in blood triglycerides in subjects whose blood triglycerides were otherwise apt to rise. We also found by in vitro emulsion studies that IMD, which had no effect on digestive enzyme activity or emulsion formation, stabilized the micro size micelle by inducing enlarged micelle particle size and increased zeta potential. In conclusion, the mechanism of inhibition of fat absorption by IMD may be a delay in micelle particles accessing the intestinal epithelium through changes in the surface structure and the physical properties of the micelle particles.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryodai Takagaki, Yuki Ishida, Tsuyoshi Sadakiyo, Yoshifumi Taniguchi, Takeo Sakurai, Hitoshi Mitsuzumi, Hikaru Watanabe, Shigeharu Fukuda, Shimpei Ushio&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different phenotypes of wheezing have been described to date but not in early life.

Background &lt;p&gt;Bedaquiline, an antimycobacterial agent approved for drug-resistant tuberculosis, is metabolized by CYP3A4, an hepatic enzyme strongly induced by rifampin, an essential part of drug-sensitive tuberculosis treatment. We examined the pharmacokinetic interactions of bedaquiline plus either rifampin or rifabutin in 33 healthy volunteers. This sub-study of that trial examined the mycobactericidal activity of these drugs against intracellular &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; whole blood culture.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subjects were randomly assigned to receive two single 400 mg doses of bedaquiline, alone, and, after a 4 week washout period, in combination with steady-state daily dosing of either rifabutin 300 mg or rifampin 600 mg. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and at multiple time points subsequently, to measure plasma drug concentrations and bactericidal activity in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo M tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;-infected whole blood cultures (WBA).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Single oral doses of bedaquiline produced readily detectable WBA &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;, reaching a maximal effect of -0.28 log/day, with negative values indicating bacterial killing. Plasma concentrations of 355 ng/ml were sufficient for intracellular mycobacteriostasis. Combined dosing with rifampin or rifabutin produced maximal effects of -0.91 and -0.79 log/d, respectively. However, the activity of the rifabutin combination was sustained throughout the dosing interval, thereby producing a greater cumulative or total effect. At low drug concentrations, rifabutin plus bedaquiline yielded greater mycobactericidal activity than the sum of their separate effects. Neither drug metabolites nor cellular drug accumulation could account for this observation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of rifabutin plus bedaquiline produces sustained intracellular mycobactericidal activity that is greater than the sum of their individual effects.

We compared the clinical characteristics, treatments, and prognoses of fungal keratitis in patients with and without diabetes. Patients diagnosed with fungal keratitis at Shandong Eye Institute between January 2010 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and classified as diabetic and nondiabetic groups. One-hundred-and-eleven patients (111 eyes) with diabetes and 740 patients (740 eyes) without diabetes were included. The diabetic patients showed significantly older (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.05) and lower male:female ratio (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Plants trauma was the primary risk factor in both groups, and there was no significant difference of pathogen type (the most common was &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; genus, followed by &lt;i&gt;Alternaria&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; genera). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that diabetes and topical glucocorticoid use were the independent risk factors for the severity of fungal keratitis. The recurrent infection rate between the diabetic and nondiabetic patients during the follow-up (6 to 24 months) after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was not significantly different. Although the recurrent epithelial defect, rejection, and best-corrected visual acuity were similar between the patients with matched bed/graft size (7.75/8.0 mm) in the two groups 1 year after PKP, the incidence of delayed re-epithelialization (&gt;7 days) was significantly higher in diabetic patients (3/10 versus 2/43 in nondiabetic patients, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). More specially, the diabetic patients with the duration ≥10 years showed more significantly delayed re-epithelialization than those with the diabetic duration less than 10 years (3/5 versus 1/26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In conclusion, the diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor that affect the severity of fungal keratitis.

This paper reports on a social discounting experiment conducted with university students in South Africa. In line with other social discounting task experiments, participants identify target individuals at different degrees of intimacy in their social network and then make 10 choices involving sums of money for themselves or their targets. For an altruism premium to exist, senders’ donations to recipients should be positive, statistically and economically significant, and independent of relationship closeness. We hypothesize that in addition to the altruism premium for kin documented in the literature, there may be other premia for family in general and for partners and friends. We find that, apart from the “kinship” premium, there is a sizeable “intimacy” premium, which together translates into a substantial “family” premium. The study also finds a “friendship premium”, as is documented in various experiments. The closeness of relationships among family and kin, especially close kin, has a significant and large effect on altruism. The results also attest to the importance of the extended family in regards to the “kinship” premium on altruism. These various premiums on altruism emphasise the importance of the supportive role of various social systems. Nevertheless, altruism within families and among close kin might also be enhanced by building more cohesive and stronger families using developmental social welfare programmes.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196175</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frederik Booysen, Sevias Guvuriro, Alistair Munro, Tshepo Moloi, Celeste Campher&lt;/p&gt;

Population dynamics in urban and rural areas are different. Understanding factors that contribute to local population changes has various socioeconomic and political implications. In the present study, we use population census data in Japan to examine contributors to the population growth of residential clusters between years 2005 and 2010. The data set covers the entirety of Japan and has a high spatial resolution of 500 × 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling us to examine population dynamics in various parts of the country (urban and rural) using statistical analysis. We found that, in addition to the area, population density, and age, the shape of the cluster and the spatial distribution of inhabitants within the cluster are significantly related to the population growth rate of a residential cluster. Specifically, the population tends to grow if the cluster is &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; shaped (given the area) and the population is concentrated near the center rather than periphery of the cluster. Combination of the present results and analysis framework with other factors that have been omitted in the present study, such as migration, terrain, and transportation infrastructure, will be fruitful.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197144</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takuya Sekiguchi, Kohei Tamura, Naoki Masuda&lt;/p&gt;

Combination of the present results and analysis framework with other factors that have been omitted in the present study, such as migration, terrain, and transportation infrastructure, will be fruitful.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4921</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4921.short?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4921.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16341385bca:541302:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>SAMHD1 enhances immunoglobulin hypermutation by promoting transversion mutation [Biochemistry]</title><crawled>1525807602634</crawled><published>1525803378000</published><fingerprint>39c1e97e</fingerprint><author><name>Eddy Sanchai Thientosapol, Daniel Bosnjak, Timothy Durack, Igor Stevanovski, Michelle van Geldermalsen, Jeff Holst, Zeenat Jahan, Caitlin Shepard, Wolfgang Weninger, Baek Kim, Robert Brink, Christopher J.

Bonner, Russell A. Epstein&lt;/p&gt;
Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithms.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XJmM-iMvR90&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael F.

Understanding the functional basis of auxin homeostasis requires knowledge about auxin biosynthesis, auxin transport and auxin catabolism genes, which is not always directly available despite the recent whole-genome sequencing of many plant species. Through sequence homology searches and phylogenetic analyses on a selection of 11 plant species with high-quality genome annotation, we identified the putative gene homologs involved in auxin biosynthesis, auxin catabolism and auxin transport pathways in carnation (&lt;i&gt;Dianthus caryophyllus&lt;/i&gt; L.). To deepen our knowledge of the regulatory events underlying auxin-mediated adventitious root formation in carnation stem cuttings, we used RNA-sequencing data to confirm the expression profiles of some auxin homeostasis genes during the rooting of two carnation cultivars with different rooting behaviors.

Animal welfare requires the adequate housing of animals to ensure health and well-being. The application of environmental enrichment is a way to improve the well-being of laboratory animals. However, it is important to know whether these enrichment items can be incorporated in experimental mouse husbandry without creating a divide between past and future experimental results. Previous small-scale studies have been inconsistent throughout the literature, and it is not yet completely understood whether and how enrichment might endanger comparability of results of scientific experiments. Here, we measured the effect on means and variability of 164 physiological parameters in 3 conditions: with nesting material with or without a shelter, comparing these 2 conditions to a “barren” regime without any enrichments. We studied a total of 360 mice from each of 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6NTac and DBA/2NCrl) and both sexes for each of the 3 conditions. Our study indicates that enrichment affects the mean values of some of the 164 parameters with no consistent effects on variability. However, the influence of enrichment appears negligible compared to the effects of other influencing factors. Therefore, nesting material and shelters may be used to improve animal welfare without impairment of experimental outcome or loss of comparability to previous data collected under barren housing conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Dd6wtkaJG8Q&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Viola André, Christine Gau, Angelika Scheideler, Juan A.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the thickness of retinal layers and association with final visual acuity using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in macular area of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients after a successful macular re-attachment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In retrospective study, a total 24 eyes with macula-off RRD were enrolled. All patients underwent vitrectomy to repair RRD. Outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor layer (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thicknesses were measured by the Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) SD-OCT with automated segmentation software. The relationship between the thicknesses of each retinal layer and postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale (LogMAR) visual acuity was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;OPL and RPE thicknesses were not significantly different between the retinal detachment eyes and fellow eyes (P = 0.839, 0.999, respectively). The ONL and photoreceptor thickness were significantly thinner in the retinal detachment eyes (P &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.001, respectively). In the univariate regression analysis, preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ONL thickness and photoreceptor thickness showed association with the postoperative BCVA (P = 0.003, &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.024, respectively). In final multiple linear regression model, ONL thickness was the only variable significantly associated with postoperative BCVA (P = 0.044).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Segmented ONL and photoreceptor thickness of retinal detachment eyes were significantly thinner than fellow eyes.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the thickness of retinal layers and association with final visual acuity using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in macular area of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients after a successful macular re-attachment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In retrospective study, a total 24 eyes with macula-off RRD were enrolled. All patients underwent vitrectomy to repair RRD. Outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor layer (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thicknesses were measured by the Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) SD-OCT with automated segmentation software. The relationship between the thicknesses of each retinal layer and postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale (LogMAR) visual acuity was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;OPL and RPE thicknesses were not significantly different between the retinal detachment eyes and fellow eyes (P = 0.839, 0.999, respectively). The ONL and photoreceptor thickness were significantly thinner in the retinal detachment eyes (P &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.001, respectively). In the univariate regression analysis, preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ONL thickness and photoreceptor thickness showed association with the postoperative BCVA (P = 0.003, &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.024, respectively). In final multiple linear regression model, ONL thickness was the only variable significantly associated with postoperative BCVA (P = 0.044).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Segmented ONL and photoreceptor thickness of retinal detachment eyes were significantly thinner than fellow eyes. Segmental analysis of the retinal layer in macular region may provide valuable information for evaluation RRD. And ONL thickness can be used as a potential biomarker to predict visual outcome after RRD repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24741-0</originId><engagement>2</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24741-0</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162f87bb03b:68832af:34f43e70</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><title>Reversal of memory and neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduced tau pathology by selenium in 3xTg-AD mice</title><crawled>1524587278395</crawled><published>1524553200000</published><fingerprint>5e17ca77</fingerprint><author><name>Ann Van der Jeugd</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reversal of memory and neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduced tau pathology by selenium in 3xTg-AD mice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversal of memory and neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduced tau pathology by selenium in 3xTg-AD mice, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24741-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24741-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Reversal of memory and neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduced tau pathology by selenium in 3xTg-AD mice&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-n-LdlyC8KE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reversal of memory and neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduced tau pathology by selenium in 3xTg-AD mice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversal of memory and neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduced tau pathology by selenium in 3xTg-AD mice, Published online: 24 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24741-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24741-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Reversal of memory and neuropsychiatric symptoms and reduced tau pathology by selenium in 3xTg-AD mice&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-n-LdlyC8KE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/-n-LdlyC8KE/s41598-018-24741-0</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24741-0</href></item></canonical><visual><width>479</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24741-0/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24741_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height></visual><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00179</originId><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00179</link><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_16322c00ef4:5c215b:2c8f7b5d</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>[ASAP] Role of l-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 at the Inner Blood-Retinal Barrier in the Blood-to-Retina Transport of Gabapentin</title><crawled>1525296402164</crawled><published>1525233600000</published><fingerprint>14f55744</fingerprint><author><name>Shin-ichi Akanuma, Atsuko Yamakoshi, Takeshi Sugouchi, Yoshiyuki Kubo, Anika M.

Mechanical ventilation is an important tool for supporting critically ill patients but may also exert pathological forces on lung cells leading to Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). We hypothesised that inhibition of the force-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV4) ion channel may attenuate the negative effects of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical stretch increased intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung epithelial cells that was partially blocked by about 30% with the selective TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874, but nearly completely blocked with the pan-calcium channel blocker ruthenium red, suggesting the involvement of more than one calcium channel in the response to mechanical stress. Mechanical stretch also induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages, but in contrast this was entirely dependent upon TRPV4. In a murine ventilation model, TRPV4 inhibition attenuated both pulmonary barrier permeability increase and pro-inflammatory cytokines release due to high tidal volume ventilation. Taken together, these data suggest TRPV4 inhibitors may have utility as a prophylactic pharmacological treatment to improve the negative pathological stretch-response of lung cells during ventilation and potentially support patients receiving mechanical ventilation.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196055</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by N.

Sentiment analysis holds promise for clinical applications, but will require a novel domain-specific method applicable to clinical text.</description><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36097</originId><engagement>1</engagement><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36097</link><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162f25c289d:5deee44:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36097</canonicalUrl><title>Optical detection of three modes of endocytosis at hippocampal synapses</title><crawled>1524484548765</crawled><published>1524441600000</published><fingerprint>c01a53a6</fingerprint><author><name>ege.kavalali@utsouthwestern.edu (Ege T Kavalali)</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Coupling of synaptic vesicle fusion and retrieval constitutes a core mechanism ensuring maintenance of presynaptic function.

Results: Using queries of relevant databases and literature searches, a single dense multiscale temporal regulatory network was identified involving core sets of genes that regulate circadian, cell cycle, and aging processes. The network was highly enriched for genes involved in signal transduction (P = 1.82e-82), with p53 and its regulators such as p300 and CREB binding protein forming key hubs, but also for genes involved in metabolism (P = 6.07e-127) and cellular response to stress (P = 1.56e-93).
