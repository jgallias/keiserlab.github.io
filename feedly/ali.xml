They’ve been working with various heme proteins, since that reactive center is known to be able to generate carbenes, and they noted one variant, in the presence of ethyl diazoacetate as a carbene source and an aryl acetylene as reactant, gave furan products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo-300x92.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo-300x92.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo.jpeg 526w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13437&quot; height=&quot;92&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are already reported as coming from a carbene mechanism, so the group thought that they must be on to something. Further screening of variants around that particular enzyme isoform turned up some that allowed a second carbene reaction to cycle around, giving the unusual bicyclobutanes shown at right. Freeing up some room around the active site was essential, otherwise the cyclopropene intermediate goes off to the furan product instead. A systematic screen of amino acid variations at the key residues of the enzyme in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, with monitoring of product production, furnished an enzyme that was capable of high turnover (enough to produce hundreds of milligrams of product). A variety of different R groups are tolerated on the phenyl, with yields from 30 to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene-300x85.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene-300x85.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene.jpeg 382w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13438&quot; height=&quot;85&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the phenylcyclopropene intermediate was not isolable, but the team also look for variants that could produce those products as well (in the non-aryl cases). Similar mutation screens against promising enzymes produced another one that could indeed furnish a variety of cyclopropenes, as shown at right, in yields of 35 to 85%. Variants were found that could produced enhanced ratios of either enantiomer, to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sorts of reactions are known in the literature, up to a point (here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/Topics/Maciej.pdf&quot;&gt;review presentation&lt;/a&gt; from the Wipf group a few years back on the topic). But such things are mostly seen on very electron-deficient alkynes and often go in lower yields than what are reported here (and I think you can largely forget about enantioselectivity). The fact that enzymes can be made to do such chemistry is remarkable, and there are surely many more such things waiting to be discovered. The metal centers in these proteins do a lot of extraordinary chemistry, and many groups are in the process of harnessing them for synthetic purposes. Seeing unusual strained systems like this being formed so readily just shows how much must be possible!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>21st Century Enzymes</title><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><description>Here’s a remarkable paper that shows how enzymes can be engineered to turn out some very unnatural-looking structures.

Background &lt;p&gt;The comparison between long acting insulin analogues (LAIA) and human insulin (NPH) has been investigated for decades, with many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews giving mixed results. This overlapping and contradictory evidence has increased uncertainty on coverage decisions at health systems level.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To conduct an overview of systematic reviews and update existing reviews, preparing new meta-analysis to determine whether LAIA are effective for T1D patients compared to NPH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified systematic reviews of RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of LAIA glargine or detemir, compared to NPH insulin for T1D, assessing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and hypoglycemia. Data sources included Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and hand-searching. The methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by two reviewers, using AMSTAR and Jadad scale. We found 11 eligible systematic reviews that contained a total of 25 relevant clinical trials. Two reviewers independently abstracted data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found evidence that LAIA are efficacious compared to NPH, with estimates showing a reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia episodes (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.57; 0.76) and A1C (95% CI 0.23; 0.12). No significance was found related to severe hypoglycemia (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.71; 1.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study design has allowed us to carry out the most comprehensive assessment of RCTs on this subject, filling a gap in diabetes research.

Background &lt;p&gt;The comparison between long acting insulin analogues (LAIA) and human insulin (NPH) has been investigated for decades, with many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews giving mixed results. This overlapping and contradictory evidence has increased uncertainty on coverage decisions at health systems level.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To conduct an overview of systematic reviews and update existing reviews, preparing new meta-analysis to determine whether LAIA are effective for T1D patients compared to NPH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified systematic reviews of RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of LAIA glargine or detemir, compared to NPH insulin for T1D, assessing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and hypoglycemia. Data sources included Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and hand-searching. The methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by two reviewers, using AMSTAR and Jadad scale. We found 11 eligible systematic reviews that contained a total of 25 relevant clinical trials. Two reviewers independently abstracted data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found evidence that LAIA are efficacious compared to NPH, with estimates showing a reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia episodes (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.57; 0.76) and A1C (95% CI 0.23; 0.12). No significance was found related to severe hypoglycemia (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.71; 1.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study design has allowed us to carry out the most comprehensive assessment of RCTs on this subject, filling a gap in diabetes research. Our paper addresses a question that is important not only for decision makers but also for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194801</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gliders, glaciers and difficult goodbyes — March’s top science images&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gliders, glaciers and difficult goodbyes — March’s top science images, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04011-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04011-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The month’s sharpest science shots — selected by Nature’s photo team.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Gliders, glaciers and difficult goodbyes — March’s top science images</title><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gliders, glaciers and difficult goodbyes — March’s top science images&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gliders, glaciers and difficult goodbyes — March’s top science images, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04011-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04011-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The month’s sharpest science shots — selected by Nature’s photo team.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04011-9</originId><fingerprint>59bd154d</fingerprint><author><name>Nisha Gaind</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04011-9</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522393200000</published><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162783f6399:7b8465b:34f43e70</id><engagement>141</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04011-9</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522435842969</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Youri Yordanov, Agnes Dechartres, Philippe Ravaud&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Cochrane reviewers are strongly encouraged to evaluate the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes by using the GRADE approach and to report these results in a Summary of Findings (SoF) table. We aimed to assess whether outcomes reported in the SoF table of Cochrane reviews could be considered patient-important outcomes (PIOs) and the quality of the available evidence for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a methodological review of Cochrane reviews published between March 2011 and September 2014. For a random sample of Cochrane reviews reporting a SoF table, we extracted all outcomes reported in this table and evaluated whether they could be considered PIOs (i.e., mortality, other clinical events, adverse events, function, pain, quality of life and therapeutic decisions). Then, we collected the quality of evidence for every outcome in these SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 290 reviews issued by 47 of the 53 Cochrane Review Groups. Every SoF table included a median of 5 outcomes, for a total of 1414 outcomes; 1089 (77%) could be considered PIOs. Almost all reviews (n = 278, 96%) included at least one PIO in their SoF table. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was high for 12% (n = 168), moderate for 28% (n = 402) and low or very low for 45% (n = 640). Less than one quarter of reviews (n = 63) included at least one PIO with high-quality evidence that favoured a benefit of the experimental intervention evaluated in half of them (n = 34 reviews).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Many outcomes reported in the SoF table of recent Cochrane reviews can be considered PIOs. However, the quality of available evidence remains limited for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Patient-important outcomes in systematic reviews: Poor quality of evidence</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195460</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195460</originId><fingerprint>941b171e</fingerprint><author><name>Youri Yordanov</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195460</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d732:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youri Yordanov, Agnes Dechartres, Philippe Ravaud&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Salivary glands are known immune effector sites and considered to be part of the whole mucosal immune system. The aim of the present study was to assess the salivary immune response to rotavirus (RV) infection through the analysis of the cytokine immune profile in saliva.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;A prospective comparative study of serial saliva samples from 27 RV-infected patients (sampled upon admission to the hospital during acute phase and at convalescence—i.e. at least three months after recovery) and 36 healthy controls was performed. Concentrations of 11 salivary cytokines (IFN-γ, IFN-α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL12&lt;sub&gt;p70&lt;/sub&gt;, TNF-α, IFN-λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-22) were determined. Cytokine levels were compared between healthy controls acute infection and convalescence. The correlation between clinical data and salivary cytokine profile in infected children was assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The salivary cytokine profile changes significantly in response to acute RV infection. In RV-infected patients, IL-22 levels were increased in the acute phase with respect to convalescence (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-value &amp;lt; 0.001). Comparisons between infected and control group showed significant differences in salivary IFN-α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-22. Although acute-phase levels of IL-12, IL-10, IL-6 and IFN-γ showed nominal association with Vesikari’s severity, this trend did not reach statistical significance after multiple test adjustment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RV infection induces a host salivary immune response, indicating that immune mucosal response to RV infection is not confined to the intestinal mucosa. Our data point to a whole mucosal implication in the RV infection as a result of the integrative mucosal immune response, and suggest the salivary gland as effector site for RV infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Rotavirus intestinal infection induces an oral mucosa cytokine response</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195314</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195314</originId><fingerprint>c984e6fb</fingerprint><author><name>José Gómez-Rial</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195314</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460b:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by José Gómez-Rial, María José Curras-Tuala, Irene Rivero-Calle, Carmen Rodríguez-Tenreiro, Lorenzo Redondo-Collazo, Alberto Gómez-Carballa, Jacobo Pardo-Seco, Antonio Salas, Federico Martinón-Torres&lt;/p&gt;

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes progressive disability in 1 of every 5,000 boys due to the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Despite much advancement in knowledge about DMD disease presentation and progression—attributable in part to studies using mouse and canine models of the disease–current DMD treatments are not equally effective in all patients. There remains, therefore, a need for translational animal models in which novel treatment targets can be identified and evaluated. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of DMD. As with DMD, speed of disease progression in GRMD varies substantially. However, unlike DMD, all GRMD dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the GRMD dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 GRMD dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which GRMD stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with DMD and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of GRMD as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) in faster-progressing GRMD dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in GRMD and DMD. In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Expression profiling of disease progression in canine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</originId><fingerprint>816dcdf7</fingerprint><author><name>Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521493200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fd:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford, Candice Chu, Cynthia Balog-Alvarez, Xue Yu, James J.

In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194485</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521481331028</crawled></item><item><title>A Library of Phosphoproteomic and Chromatin Signatures for Characterizing Cellular Responses to Drug Perturbations</title><origin><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell Systems</title><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/24054712</streamId></origin><description>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Lev Litichevskiy, Ryan Peckner, Jennifer G.

We have previously investigated the physiological role of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on endochondral bone growth, mainly with mutant mouse models deficient in CNP, and reported that CNP is indispensable for physiological endochondral bone growth in mice. However, the survival rate of CNP knockout (KO) mice fell to as low as about 70% until 10 weeks after birth, and we could not sufficiently analyze the phenotype at the adult stage. Herein, we generated CNP KO rats by using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated genome editing technology. We established two lines of mutant rats completely deficient in CNP (CNP KO rats) that exhibited a phenotype identical to that observed in mice deficient in CNP, namely, a short stature with severely impaired endochondral bone growth. Histological analysis revealed that the width of the growth plate, especially that of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, was markedly lower and the proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes tended to be reduced in CNP KO rats. Notably, CNP KO rats did not have malocclusions and survived for over one year after birth. At 33 weeks of age, CNP KO rats persisted significantly shorter than wild-type rats, with closed growth plates of the femur in all samples, which were not observed in wild-type rats. Histologically, CNP deficiency affected only bones among all body tissues studied. Thus, CNP KO rats survive over one year, and exhibit a deficit in endochondral bone growth and growth retardation throughout life.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Rats deficient C-type natriuretic peptide suffer from impaired skeletal growth without early death</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194812</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194812</originId><fingerprint>f8b07d22</fingerprint><author><name>Toshihito Fujii</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194812</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b5:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Toshihito Fujii, Keisho Hirota, Akihiro Yasoda, Akiko Takizawa, Naomi Morozumi, Ryuichi Nakamura, Takafumi Yotsumoto, Eri Kondo, Yui Yamashita, Yoriko Sakane, Yugo Kanai, Yohei Ueda, Ichiro Yamauchi, Shigeki Yamanaka, Kazumasa Nakao, Koichiro Kuwahara, Toshimasa Jindo, Mayumi Furuya, Tomoji Mashimo, Nobuya Inagaki, Tadao Serikawa, Kazuwa Nakao&lt;/p&gt;

Natural reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;Yersinia (Y&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; comprise different animal species, but little is known about the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of yersiniosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218). The remaining 18 isolates belonged to bio-serotypes 1B/NI (3/218, 1.4%), 1B/O:8 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/NI (6/218, 2.8%), 2/O:27 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:9 (2/218, 0.9%), 3/NI (2/218, 0.9%), 4/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%) and 4/O:9 (1/218, 0.5%).

Natural reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;Yersinia (Y&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; comprise different animal species, but little is known about the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of yersiniosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218). The remaining 18 isolates belonged to bio-serotypes 1B/NI (3/218, 1.4%), 1B/O:8 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/NI (6/218, 2.8%), 2/O:27 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:9 (2/218, 0.9%), 3/NI (2/218, 0.9%), 4/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%) and 4/O:9 (1/218, 0.5%). The &lt;i&gt;ail&lt;/i&gt; gene, a suggestive virulence gene for &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, has been found in 30 isolates from 20 wild boars, in 6 isolates from red deer, and in 1 isolate from roe deer. Our study demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; is frequently isolated from game animals in Poland, which poses a risk of spreading these infectious agents to other animal species and humans.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195136</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Inhomogeneity induced and appropriately parameterized semilocal exchange and correlation energy functionals in two-dimensions</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019251?af=R</originId><fingerprint>c82e6e9a</fingerprint><author><name>Abhilash Patra</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019251?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522906298000</published><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b5d:7c9981b6</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019251?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523085743269</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Solid-state conducting polymers usually have highly conjugated macromolecular backbones and require intentional doping in order to achieve high electrical conductivities.

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis is maintained through Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels such as MgtE, a prokaryotic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel whose gating is regulated by intracellular Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. Our previous crystal structure of MgtE in the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound, closed state revealed the existence of seven crystallographically-independent Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding sites, Mg1–Mg7. The role of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding to each site in channel closure remains unknown.

Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis is maintained through Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels such as MgtE, a prokaryotic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel whose gating is regulated by intracellular Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels.

Ocular tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes severe inflammation and vision loss in TB-endemic countries. The mechanism by which tuberculous infection becomes established in the eye is poorly understood. We have developed the zebrafish larva infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; as a model to study the early pathogenesis of ocular TB. We find that hematogenous bacterial seeding of the eye occurs despite a functional blood retinal barrier. Prototypical early granulomas form in response to bacteria in the eye. These granulomas involve the retinal vasculature and retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex which are characteristic locations for human ocular TB. We find that peripheral blood monocytes are recruited to the nascent ocular granuloma further suggesting that the immune privileged nature of the eye is breached by this inflammatory focus.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A zebrafish model for ocular tuberculosis</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194982</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194982</originId><fingerprint>4c6f02bb</fingerprint><author><name>Kevin Takaki</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194982</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522184400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1c:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Takaki, Lalita Ramakrishnan, Soumyava Basu&lt;/p&gt;

The C-terminus domain of non-structural 3 (NS3) protein of the &lt;i&gt;Flaviviridae&lt;/i&gt; viruses (e.g. HCV, dengue, West Nile, Zika) is a nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) -dependent superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA while translocating along the nucleic polymer. Due to these functions, NS3 is an important target for antiviral development yet the biophysics of this enzyme are poorly understood. Microsecond-long molecular dynamic simulations of the dengue NS3 helicase domain are reported from which allosteric effects of RNA and NTPase substrates are observed. The presence of a bound single-stranded RNA catalytically enhances the phosphate hydrolysis reaction by affecting the dynamics and positioning of waters within the hydrolysis active site. Coupled with results from the simulations, electronic structure calculations of the reaction are used to quantify this enhancement to be a 150-fold increase, in qualitative agreement with the experimental enhancement factor of 10–100. Additionally, protein-RNA interactions exhibit NTPase substrate-induced allostery, where the presence of a nucleotide (e.g. ATP or ADP) structurally perturbs residues in direct contact with the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. Residue-residue network analyses highlight pathways of short ranged interactions that connect the two active sites. These analyses identify motif V as a highly connected region of protein structure through which energy released from either active site is hypothesized to move, thereby inducing the observed allosteric effects. These results lay the foundation for the design of novel allosteric inhibitors of NS3.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tae9aMgOb9I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Allostery in the dengue virus NS3 helicase: Insights into the NTPase cycle from molecular simulations</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006103</link><recrawled>1523911321731</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006103</originId><fingerprint>76488b6</fingerprint><author><name>Russell B.

We highlight a new role for non-interacting regions in preventing non-functional interactions and guiding the interaction process toward functional interactions.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298174v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>961e27a5</fingerprint><author><name>Schweke, H.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298174v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523257200000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162acbc3764:19053b5:9aea0a7d</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298174v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/09/298174</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523316438884</crawled></item><item><content><content>Rapid advances in sequencing technologies are producing genomic data on an unprecedented scale.

Background &lt;p&gt;Proprioception deficits are common post-stroke and predict poor functional outcome. It is unknown if the presence of proprioception deficits is negatively associated with the motor and functional ability of the affected upper extremity and daily living at the chronic stage post-stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Aims &lt;p&gt;1) To describe proprioception deficits of individuals with chronic stroke, 2) to correlate the severity of proprioception deficits with the motor and functional ability of the upper extremity, and 3) to compare independence in basic and instrumental activities in daily living (BADL, IADL), upper extremity motor and functional abilities between individuals with and without proprioception deficits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;102 adults aged 29–85 years with chronic stroke participated in this cross sectional study. The upper extremity was assessed for proprioception (Thumb localization Test), motor [Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA)] and functional ability [Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT)], grip strength and daily use [Motor Activity Log (MAL)]. Independence in BADL and IADL was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;71 participants had intact proprioception, 31 participants had mild-moderate proprioception deficits. Negative significant (p&amp;lt;.001) correlations were found between the severity of proprioception deficits to the motor ability (FMA) (r = -.41), functional ability (ARAT) (r = -.48), dexterity (BBT) (r = -.43), grip strength (r = -.41) and daily-use (MAL amount and quality) (r = -.55 and r = -.54, respectively) of the affected upper extremity. Significant between-group differences were found for BADL, IADL and upper extremity measures.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Proprioception deficits of individuals with chronic stroke are negatively associated with upper extremity motor and functional abilities and independence in daily living.

Large placental and birth weight, and fetal male sex were factors for a long cord, which again was associated with a doubled risk of intrauterine and perinatal death, and increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome. Anomalous cord insertion, female sex, and a small placenta were associated with a short cord, which was associated with increased risk of fetal malformations, placental complications, caesarean delivery, non-cephalic presentation, perinatal and intrauterine death. At term, cord knot was associated with a quadrupled risk of perinatal death. The combination of a cord knot and entanglement had a more than additive effect to the association to perinatal death. There was a more than doubled risk of recurrence of a long or short cord, knot and entanglement in a subsequent pregnancy of the same woman.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cord length is influenced both by maternal and fetal factors, and there is increased risk of recurrence.

Finally, we apply SVCA to high-dimensional imaging-derived RNA data, where we identify molecular pathways that are linked to cell-cell interactions.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/265256v3?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>f520d4f5</fingerprint><author><name>Arnol, D.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/265256v3?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522134000000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626822fa8a:6371206:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/265256v3?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/265256</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522165545610</crawled></item><item><title>Transient external force induces phenotypic reversion of malignant epithelial structures via nitric oxide signaling</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><description>Non-malignant breast epithelial cells cultured in three-dimensional laminin-rich extracellular matrix (lrECM) form well organized, growth-arrested acini, whereas malignant cells form continuously growing disorganized structures.

Understanding the regulation of insulin biosynthesis is important as it plays a central role in glucose metabolism. The mouse insulin gene2 (Ins2) has two splice variants; long (Ins2L) and short (Ins2S), that differ only in their 5’UTR sequence and Ins2S is the major transcript which translate more efficiently as compared to Ins2L. Here, we show that cellular factors bind preferentially to the Ins2L 5’UTR, and that PABP and HuD can bind to Ins2 splice variants and regulate its translation. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding assay with insulin 5’UTR and different HuD isoforms indicate that the ‘N’ terminal region of HuD is important for RNA binding and insulin translation repression. Using reporter assay we showed that specifically full-length HuD A isoform represses translation of reporter containing insulin 5’UTR. We further show that PABP and HuD interact with each other in RNA-dependent manner and this interaction is affected by glucose and PDI (5’UTR associated translation activator). These results suggest that PABP interacts with HuD in basal glucose conditions making translation inhibitory complex, however upon glucose stimulation this association is affected and PABP is acted upon by PDI resulting in stimulation of insulin translation. Together, our findings snapshot the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of insulin biosynthesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Interaction of HuDA and PABP at 5&apos;UTR of mouse insulin2 regulates insulin biosynthesis</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194482</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194482</originId><fingerprint>cec3ed0e</fingerprint><author><name>Poonam R.

Diverse plant pathogens export effector proteins to reprogram host cells. One of the most challenging goals in the molecular plant-microbe field is to functionally characterize the complex repertoires of effectors secreted by these pathogens. For bacterial pathogens, the predominant class of effectors is delivered to host cells by Type III secretion. For oomycetes, the predominant class of effectors is defined by a signal peptide that mediates secretion from the oomycete and a conserved RxLR motif. Downy mildew pathogens and &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/i&gt; species maintain hundreds of candidate RxLR effector genes in their genomes. Although no primary sequence similarity is evident between bacterial Type III effectors (T3Es) and oomycete RXLR effectors, some bacterial and oomycete effectors have convergently evolved to target the same host proteins. Such effectors might have evolved domains that are functionally similar but sequence-unrelated. We reasoned that alignment-free bioinformatics approaches could be useful to identify structural similarities between bacterial and oomycete effectors. To test this approach, we used partial least squares regression, alignment-free bioinformatics methods to identify effector proteins from the genome of the oomycete &lt;i&gt;Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis&lt;/i&gt; that are similar to the well-studied AvrE1 effector from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. This approach identified five RxLR proteins with putative structural similarity to AvrE1. We focused on one, HaRxL23, because it is an experimentally validated effector and it is conserved between distantly related oomycetes. Several experiments indicate that HaRxL23 is functionally similar to AvrE1, including the ability to partially rescue an AvrE1 loss-of-function mutant. This study provides an example of how an alignment-free bioinformatics approach can identify functionally similar effector proteins in the absence of primary sequence similarity. This approach could be useful to identify effectors that have convergently evolved regardless of whether the shared host target is known.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Application of alignment-free bioinformatics methods to identify an oomycete protein with structural and functional similarity to the bacterial AvrE effector protein</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195559</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195559</originId><fingerprint>48434103</fingerprint><author><name>Devdutta Deb</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195559</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523480400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd91:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Devdutta Deb, David Mackey, Stephen O.

Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters inside a living cell will lead to major advances in our understanding of biology and complex diseases, such as cancer. It also enables the development of new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Progress in nanofabrication and wireless communication has opened up the potential of making a wireless chip small enough that it can be wholly inserted into a living cell. To investigate how such chips could be internalized into various types of living single cells and how this process might affect cells’ physiology, we designed and fabricated a series of multilayered micron-scale tag structures with different sizes as potential RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cell trackers. While the present structures are test structures that do not resonate, the tags that do resonate have similar structure from device fabrication, material properties, and device size point of view. The structures are in four different sizes, the largest with the lateral dimension of 9 μm × 21 μm. The thickness for these structures is kept constant at 1.5 μm. We demonstrate successful delivery of our fabricated chips into various types of living cells, such as melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and healthy/normal fibroblast skin cells. To our surprise, we observed a remarkable internalization rate difference between each cell type; the uptake rate was faster for more aggressive cancer cells than the normal/healthy cells. Cell viability before and after tag cellular internalization and persistence of the internalized tags have also been recorded over the course of five days of incubation. These results establish the foundations of the possibility of long term, wireless, intracellular physiological signal monitoring.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Internalization of subcellular-scale microfabricated chips by healthy and cancer cells</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194712</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194712</originId><fingerprint>34706f2b</fingerprint><author><name>Kokab B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Acute gastroenteritis illness is a common illness that causes considerable morbidity, but current estimates of the cost to the Australian healthcare system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the current healthcare utilisation and direct public healthcare system costs attributable to acute gastroenteritis illness in Australia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is an incidence-based cost-of-illness study focused on quantifying direct health care costs using a bottom-up approach.

Background &lt;p&gt;Acute gastroenteritis illness is a common illness that causes considerable morbidity, but current estimates of the cost to the Australian healthcare system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the current healthcare utilisation and direct public healthcare system costs attributable to acute gastroenteritis illness in Australia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is an incidence-based cost-of-illness study focused on quantifying direct health care costs using a bottom-up approach. Data on general practitioner consultations, prescribed medications, diagnostic tests, specialist consultations, emergency department visits and hospital admissions were collected from national reports.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2016 prices, the estimated annual direct per capita cost of acute gastroenteritis illness was AUD$14.87 (USD$10.71), equating to AUD$20.27 (USD$14.59) per case.

Background &lt;p&gt;The impact of obesity on survival is known to vary in different cancers. Advanced biliary tract cancer was rarely analyzed about the relationship between obesity and prognosis. We performed this study to evaluate the BMI and body weight change as prognostic factors for advanced biliary tract cancer patients with palliative chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between January 2005 and December 2016, two hundred and seventy-six patients who underwent chemotherapy for biliary tract cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The relationship between BMI (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and clinical outcomes including overall and progression-free survival was assessed. Additionally the relationship between change in body composition and overall survival was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Median overall survival was 9.7 months for underweight patients, 10.1 months for normal patients, 15.8 months for overweight group, 13.1 months for obese patients, respectively. (p = 0.047) Univariate analysis showed that BMI, stage III, age less than 64 year-old, gallbladder cancer, operation, radiotherapy and ECOG performance were significantly associated with better survival. Compared with normal patients, overweight patients (BMI 23–24.9kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) had a reduced risk of mortality in multivariate analysis (HR 0.632; 95% CI 0.436–0.918, p = 0.016). In the additional analysis for the effect of changes in body weight and BMI to the overall survival, decrease in body weight and BMI (HR 1.410, 95% CI 1.168–1.986, p = 0.046) was associated with a shorter in overall survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Overweight status and the maintenance of body weight during the initial period of chemotherapy are important and independent predictors of better overall survival in advanced biliary tract cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Body mass index and weight change during initial period of chemotherapy affect survival outcome in advanced biliary tract cancer patients</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195118</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195118</originId><fingerprint>fbc1694c</fingerprint><author><name>Jinwoo Kang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195118</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522702800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76921:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinwoo Kang, Sang Hyub Lee, Jun Hyuk Son, Jae Woo Lee, Young Hoon Choi, Jin Ho Choi, Woo Hyun Paik, Ji Kon Ryu, Yong-Tae Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Living animal cells are strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of their environment. To model physiological conditions ultrasoft cell culture substrates, in some instances with elasticity (Young&apos;s modulus) of only 1 kPa, are mandatory. Due to their long shelf life PDMS-based elastomers are a popular choice. However, uncertainty about additives in commercial formulations and difficulties to reach very soft materials limit their use. Here, we produced silicone elastomers from few, chemically defined and commercially available substances. Elastomers exhibited elasticities in the range from 1 kPa to 55 kPa. In detail, a high molecular weight (155 kg/mol), vinyl-terminated linear silicone was crosslinked with a multifunctional (f = 51) crosslinker (a copolymer of dimethyl siloxane and hydrosilane) by a platinum catalyst. The following different strategies towards ultrasoft materials were explored: sparse crosslinking, swelling with inert silicone polymers, and, finally, deliberate introduction of dangling ends into the network (inhibition). Rheological experiments with very low frequencies led to precise viscoelastic characterizations. All strategies enabled tuning of stiffness with the lowest stiffness of ~1 kPa reached by inhibition. This system was also most practical to use. Biocompatibility of materials was tested using primary cortical neurons from rats.

Even after several days of cultivation no adverse effects were found.</description><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><crawled>1523036346876</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase as an anabolic therapy for bone loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase as an anabolic therapy for bone loss, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0005-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0005-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Promoting more bone growth is of keen interest in the treatment of osteoporosis, and preventing the degradation of S1P offers a new therapeutic avenue for this approach.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/CjkROWJSOc8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase as an anabolic therapy for bone loss</title><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase as an anabolic therapy for bone loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase as an anabolic therapy for bone loss, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0005-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0005-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Promoting more bone growth is of keen interest in the treatment of osteoporosis, and preventing the degradation of S1P offers a new therapeutic avenue for this approach.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/CjkROWJSOc8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0005-y</originId><engagementRate>1.06</engagementRate><fingerprint>4fcf5e61</fingerprint><author><name>Sarah Weske</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/CjkROWJSOc8/s41591-018-0005-y</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523862000000</published><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_162cf1330b4:2a3da2b:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>35</engagement><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0005-y</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0005-y</link><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0005-y/MediaObjects/41591_2018_5_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>479</height></visual><crawled>1523892564148</crawled></item><item><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25153?af=R</originId><fingerprint>b4b4790d</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25153?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522120210699</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162656f390b:6ce13:76251cdd</id><unread>False</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25153?af=R</link><crawled>1522120210699</crawled></item><item><content><content>Enterococcus faecium though commensals in human gut, few strains provide beneficial effect to humans as probiotics, few are responsible for nosocomial infection and few as non-pathogens.

In this study, we compared E. faecium strain 17OM39 with a marketed probiotic, non-pathogenic non-probiotic (NPNP) and pathogenic strains. The core genome analysis revealed, 17OM39 was closely related with marketed probiotic strain T110. Strain 17OM39 was found to be devoid of known vancomycin, tetracycline resistance genes and functional virulence genes. Moreover, 17OM39 is &apos;less open&apos; due to absence of frequently found transposable elements.

The theory has been that these are always going to be in there fighting against your efforts to kill off the downstream tumor cells, so unless you find a way to target them, you’re not going to be successful. As that blog post shows, though, this area was imperfectly understood at the time, and it has not gotten a great deal more clear since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company that I wrote about, though, Stemcentrx, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/04/28/stemcentrx-scooped-up&quot;&gt;bought a few months later&lt;/a&gt; by AbbVie for &lt;em&gt;5.8 billion dollars in cash&lt;/em&gt; (and promises of about four billion more if things worked out). At the time, I wrote (uncontroversially, I think) that “this deal is going to end up looking either very smart or very stupid”. The lead program out of this deal, Rova-T, is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4934375/&quot;&gt;antibody-drug&lt;/a&gt; conjugate (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovalpituzumab_tesirine&quot;&gt;rovalpituzumab tesirine&lt;/a&gt;) which was aimed at small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL3&quot;&gt;DLL3&lt;/a&gt; protein found on the surface of some cell types. The antibody targets DLL, and the conjugate has a cleavable linker that delivers a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer as a DNA-damaging payload. SCLC is bad news, so any advances in this field would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on in 2016, AbbVie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/abbvie-turns-its-first-card-bold-10b-gamble-rova-t&quot;&gt;presented data&lt;/a&gt; from a small trial (I believe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(16)30565-4/fulltext&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) that showed that response rates did seem to correlate with DLL3 expression. But the rates themselves were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2016/06/05/abbvies-new-lung-cancer-drug-may-extend-patients-lives-but-could-disappoint-investors/#64bce5bf7c53&quot;&gt;not all that impressive&lt;/a&gt;, in the larger scheme of things, and overall, people didn’t seem very impressed. AbbVie pushed on, though, seeking accelerated approval from the FDA, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/abbvie-shares-tank-on-rova-t-flop-retreat-from-accelerated-approval-pitch/&quot;&gt;today we have the latest results&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately. The company reported the response rate from the DLL3-high patient group, and it’s only 16% (which is the same or worse than standard of care response rates), and the survival data are not impressive, either. &lt;em&gt;(Update: it’s quite likely that this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://epvantage.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&amp;id=774872&amp;isEPVantage=yes&quot;&gt;even worse&lt;/a&gt; than it seems!)&lt;/em&gt; The stock market is not taking this well. ABBV is down $12 a share as I write, which takes out nearly $20 billion dollars of market cap from the stock. The fear is that if this is the DLL3-high group, which is supposed to be the best of the bunch, what are the full Phase 3 results going to look like? Forget about accelerated approval – AbbVie sure has to – what are the chances that this program works well enough to be approved at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also puts a bit of a hole in the cancer-stem-cell idea in general. It’s a complicated enough field that you’re not going to disprove it with a single agent or in a single type of cancer, but this does show that it’s not even as straightforward as it looks (and it didn’t look that straightforward!) As for this specific approach, and this specific deal, well. . .I suppose things could change eventually, but for now, it’s a disaster. We’ll see what AbbVie does after the full data come out. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2018/03/22/peter-thiel-backed-a-biotech-big-pharma-bought-it-it-blew-up/#4e92563d301f&quot;&gt;Matthew Herper’s take&lt;/a&gt; on this is well worth reading.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an emerging threat to public health worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high virulence and case fatality rate (about 35%) since 2012. Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an emerging threat to public health worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high virulence and case fatality rate (about 35%) since 2012. Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization. Unlike in established cells, toremifene had marginal activity when tested in antigen presenting cells, with high apparent cytotoxicity, also limiting its potential as a therapeutic option. These results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells, in addition to established cell lines, before initiating preclinical or clinical studies for MERS treatment and the importance of carefully assessing cytotoxicity in drug screen assays. Furthermore, these studies also highlight the role of APCs in stimulating a robust protective immune response to MERS-CoV infection.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194868</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521741783044</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;In temperate and boreal ecosystems, seasonal cycles of growth and dormancy allow perennial plants to adapt to winter conditions.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Vaginal delivery has been recommended for more than ten years for women living with HIV (WLWH) with good virological control. However, in Europe most WLWH still deliver by cesarean section (CS). Our aim was to assess the rate of vaginal delivery and the indications for CS in WLWH over 20 years in a setting of low overall CS rate.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of all WLWH delivering in Finland 1993–2013. We identified the women by combining national health registers and extracted data from patient files.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study comprised 212 women with 290 deliveries. Over 35% of the women delivered several children during the study years. During 2000–2013, with consistent viral load monitoring, 80.0% showed HIV viral loads &amp;lt;50 copies/mL in the last measurement preceding the delivery. Altogether 74.5% of all WLWH delivered vaginally and the rate of both elective CS and emergency CS was 12.8% each. For most CSs (63.5%) the indication was obstetrical, for 28.4% it was avoiding HIV transmission and for 0.7% it was mother’s request. In hospitals with less than ten HIV-related deliveries during the study period, the rate of elective CS was higher than in more experienced hospitals (22.7% versus 10.6% [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024]). No perinatal HIV transmissions occurred.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most WLWH can achieve good virological control and deliver vaginally. This will help them to maintain their future child bearing potential and reduce CS-related morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Most women living with HIV can deliver vaginally—National data from Finland 1993–2013</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</originId><fingerprint>f1ad52a1</fingerprint><author><name>Inka Aho</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123922:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inka Aho, Marja Kaijomaa, Pia Kivelä, Heljä-Marja Surcel, Jussi Sutinen, Oskari Heikinheimo, with the FINHIVPREG Study team &lt;/p&gt;

These interactions are often assumed to involve a fitness cost, prompting questions on how cooperative phenotypes can be stable and withstand the emergence of cheaters. Here we use genome-scale models of metabolism to investigate whether a radically different scenario, the pervasive release of &amp;quot;costless&amp;quot; metabolites (i.e. those that cause no fitness cost to the producing organism), can serve as a prominent mechanism for inter-microbial interactions. By carrying out over 1 million pairwise growth simulations for 14 microbial species in a combinatorial assortment of environmental conditions, we find that there is indeed a large space of metabolites that can be secreted at no cost, which can generate ample cross-feeding opportunities.

These interactions are often assumed to involve a fitness cost, prompting questions on how cooperative phenotypes can be stable and withstand the emergence of cheaters. Here we use genome-scale models of metabolism to investigate whether a radically different scenario, the pervasive release of &amp;quot;costless&amp;quot; metabolites (i.e. those that cause no fitness cost to the producing organism), can serve as a prominent mechanism for inter-microbial interactions.

Koalas (&lt;i&gt;Phascolarctos cinereus&lt;/i&gt;) are iconic Australian marsupials currently threatened by several processes, including infectious diseases and ecological disruption. Infection with &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, is considered a key driver of population decline. The clinical sign of ‘wet bottom’, a staining of the rump associated with urinary incontinence, is often caused by chlamydial urinary tract infections. However, wet bottom has been recorded in koalas free of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting other causative agents in those individuals. We used 16S rRNA diversity profiling to investigate the microbiome of the urogenital tract of ten female koalas in order to identify potential causative agents of wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;. Five urogenital samples were processed from koalas presenting with wet bottom and five were clinically normal. All koalas were negative for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. We detected thirteen phyla across the ten samples, with &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; occurring at the highest relative abundance (77.6%). The order &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillales&lt;/i&gt;, within the &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, comprised 70.3% of the reads from all samples. After normalising reads using DESeq2 and testing for significant differences (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), there were 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) more commonly found in one group over the other. The families &lt;i&gt;Aerococcaceae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; both had four significantly differentially abundant OTUs. These four &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; OTUs were all significantly more abundant in koalas with wet bottom. This study provides the foundation for future investigations of causes of koala wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. This is of clinical relevance as wet bottom is often assumed to be caused by &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; and treated accordingly. Our research highlights that other organisms may be causing wet bottom, and these potential aetiological agents need to be further investigated to fully address the problems this species faces.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Variation in the microbiome of the urogenital tract of &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&amp;lt;/i&gt;-free female koalas (&amp;lt;i&gt;Phascolarctos cinereus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) with and without ‘wet bottom’</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194881</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194881</originId><fingerprint>799512a9</fingerprint><author><name>Alistair R.

The immune state of wild animals is largely unknown. Knowing this and what affects it is important in understanding how infection and disease affects wild animals. The immune state of wild animals is also important in understanding the biology of their pathogens, which is directly relevant to explaining pathogen spillover among species, including to humans. The paucity of knowledge about wild animals&apos; immune state is in stark contrast to our exquisitely detailed understanding of the immunobiology of laboratory animals. Making an immune response is costly, and many factors (such as age, sex, infection status, and body condition) have individually been shown to constrain or promote immune responses. But, whether or not these factors affect immune responses and immune state in wild animals, their relative importance, and how they interact (or do not) are unknown. Here, we have investigated the immune ecology of wild house mice—the same species as the laboratory mouse—as an example of a wild mammal, characterising their adaptive humoral, adaptive cellular, and innate immune state. Firstly, we show how immune variation is structured among mouse populations, finding that there can be extensive immune discordance among neighbouring populations. Secondly, we identify the principal factors that underlie the immunological differences among mice, showing that body condition promotes and age constrains individuals’ immune state, while factors such as microparasite infection and season are comparatively unimportant. By applying a multifactorial analysis to an immune system-wide analysis, our results bring a new and unified understanding of the immunobiology of a wild mammal.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6q0s1nnNEUE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The ecology of immune state in a wild mammal, &amp;lt;i&gt;Mus musculus domesticus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003538</link><recrawled>1523642773780</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003538</originId><engagementRate>0.12</engagementRate><fingerprint>c5b1a7f5</fingerprint><author><name>Stephen Abolins</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/6q0s1nnNEUE/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523653200000</published><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162c02eb7f8:4e48b:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephen Abolins, Luke Lazarou, Laura Weldon, Louise Hughes, Elizabeth C.

The modulatory role of the primary motor cortex (M1), reflected by an inhibitory effect of M1-stimulation on clinical pain, motivated us to deepen our understanding of M1’s role in pain modulation. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)-induced virtual lesion (VL) to interrupt with M1 activity during noxious heat pain. We hypothesized that TMS-VL will effect experimental pain ratings. Three VL protocols were applied consisting of single-pulse TMS to transiently interfere with right M1 activity: (1) VL&lt;sub&gt;M1&lt;/sub&gt;- TMS applied to 11 subjects, 20 msec before the individual’s first pain-related M1 peak activation, as determined by source analysis (sLORETA), (2) VL&lt;sub&gt;-50&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 50 ms prior to noxious stimulus onset), and (3) VL&lt;sub&gt;+150&lt;/sub&gt; (N = 16; TMS applied 150 ms after noxious stimulus onset). Each protocol included 3 conditions (&apos;pain-alone&apos;, &apos; TMS-VL&apos;, and ‘SHAM-VL’), each consisted of 30 noxious heat stimuli. Pain ratings were compared, in each protocol, for TMS-VL vs. SHAM-VL and vs. pain-alone conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance, corrected for multiple comparisons revealed no significant differences in the pain ratings between the different conditions within each protocol. Therefore, our results from this exploratory study suggest that a single pulse TMS-induced VL that is targeted to M1 failed to interrupt experimental pain processing in the specific three stimulation timing examined here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Can a single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation targeted to the motor cortex interrupt pain processing?</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</originId><fingerprint>228e14c4</fingerprint><author><name>Lee-Bareket Kisler</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195739</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523307600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a1:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lee-Bareket Kisler, Ilan Gurion, Yelena Granovsky, Alon Sinai, Elliot Sprecher, Simone Shamay-Tsoory, Irit Weissman-Fogel&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;People with low health literacy are more likely to delay seeking care and experience adverse outcomes. While health literacy is the product of individuals’ capacities, it is also affected by the complexities of the health care system. System-level changes are needed to align health care demands better with the public’s skills and abilities. We aimed to identify the evidence base for effective strategies for creating health literate organisations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review and narrative synthesis of empirical studies was performed. Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and CINHAL databases were searched for empirical studies from OECD countries published from 2008 onwards, focusing on health literacy interventions at the organisational level.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;People with low health literacy are more likely to delay seeking care and experience adverse outcomes. While health literacy is the product of individuals’ capacities, it is also affected by the complexities of the health care system. System-level changes are needed to align health care demands better with the public’s skills and abilities. We aimed to identify the evidence base for effective strategies for creating health literate organisations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review and narrative synthesis of empirical studies was performed. Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and CINHAL databases were searched for empirical studies from OECD countries published from 2008 onwards, focusing on health literacy interventions at the organisational level. Analysis of the findings was informed by the National Academies’ five-dimensional framework for the attributes of a health literate organisation, which include: organisational commitment, accessible education and technology infrastructure, augmented workforce, embedded policies and practices, and effective bidirectional communication.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The title and abstract of 867 records were screened according to the selection criteria, leading to full text review of 125 articles. Seven studies were identified in the peer review literature. Adapting health literacy guidelines and tools was the most common approach to addressing organisational health literacy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;While the use of health literacy tools proved important for raising awareness of health literacy issues within organisations, these tools were insufficient for generating the organisational changes necessary to improve organisational health literacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195018</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ramon Blanco-Gonzalo, Chiara Lunerti, Raul Sanchez-Reillo, Richard Guest&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Correction: Biometrics: Accessibility challenge or opportunity?</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196372</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196372</originId><fingerprint>aa4efb94</fingerprint><author><name>Ramon Blanco-Gonzalo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196372</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524171600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f790c:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ramon Blanco-Gonzalo, Chiara Lunerti, Raul Sanchez-Reillo, Richard Guest&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><updated>1524171600000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1524159904718</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Differential glucose requirement in skin homeostasis and injury identifies a therapeutic target for psoriasis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differential glucose requirement in skin homeostasis and injury identifies a therapeutic target for psoriasis, Published online: 16 April 2018;

Antennal sensory units in nymphs and adults of the spotted Lanternfly, &lt;i&gt;Lycorma delicatula&lt;/i&gt; (White) (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Fulgoridae), an economically important plant pest, are studied with scanning electron microscopy. Sensilla trichodea / chaetica type recognition is based on their external morphology and ratio of their size to diameter. The flagellum Bourgoin’s organ is a complex sensory unit with 2–3 internal sensilla coeloconica. During nymphal stages, the sensory surface available for a chemoreceptive function particularly increases with the number and size of sensilla placodea on the antennal pedicel. From first to fourth instar and to adult males and females, plate organ sensory surface is estimated to increase respectively by 33x, 68x and 125x (= 2.72 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.02 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively for males and females). The most important increase (5x) occurs between second and third instar. In parallel, a distinctive pair of plate organs on the flagellum decreases in size from first to third instar, and disappears.

We investigated how visual and kinaesthetic/efferent information is integrated for speed perception in running. Twelve moderately trained to trained subjects ran on a treadmill at three different speeds (8, 10, 12 km/h) in front of a moving virtual scene. They were asked to match the visual speed of the scene to their running speed–i.e., treadmill’s speed. For each trial, participants indicated whether the scene was moving slower or faster than they were running. Visual speed was adjusted according to their response using a staircase until the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) was reached, i.e., until visual and running speed were perceived as equivalent. For all three running speeds, participants systematically underestimated the visual speed relative to their actual running speed. Indeed, the speed of the visual scene had to exceed the actual running speed in order to be perceived as equivalent to the treadmill speed. The underestimation of visual speed was speed-dependent, and percentage of underestimation relative to running speed ranged from 15% at 8km/h to 31% at 12km/h. We suggest that this fact should be taken into consideration to improve the design of attractive treadmill-mediated virtual environments enhancing engagement into physical activity for healthier lifestyles and disease prevention and care.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Matching optical flow to motor speed in virtual reality while running on a treadmill</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</originId><fingerprint>7fb183c6</fingerprint><author><name>Martina Caramenti</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523480400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d5:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Caramenti, Claudio L.

Under a condition of transcriptional arrest, cells were manipulated by overexpressing miRNAs. We observed global time-dependent changes in mRNA retention which are not restricted to the overexpressed miRNA targets. We developed COMICS (Competition of miRNA Interactions in Cell Systems), a stochastic computational iterative framework for identifying general principles in miRNA regulation. We show that altering the composition of miRNAs governs cell identity. We identified gene sets that exhibit a coordinated behavior with respect to an exhaustive overexpression of all miRNAs. Among the stable genes that exhibit high mRNA retention levels, many participate in translation and belong to the translation machinery. The stable genes are shared among all tested cell, in contrast to the sensitive, low retention genes that are cell-type specific.

Under a condition of transcriptional arrest, cells were manipulated by overexpressing miRNAs. We observed global time-dependent changes in mRNA retention which are not restricted to the overexpressed miRNA targets. We developed COMICS (Competition of miRNA Interactions in Cell Systems), a stochastic computational iterative framework for identifying general principles in miRNA regulation. We show that altering the composition of miRNAs governs cell identity. We identified gene sets that exhibit a coordinated behavior with respect to an exhaustive overexpression of all miRNAs. Among the stable genes that exhibit high mRNA retention levels, many participate in translation and belong to the translation machinery. The stable genes are shared among all tested cell, in contrast to the sensitive, low retention genes that are cell-type specific. We conclude that the stochastic nature of miRNA action imparts an unexpected robustness to living cells. The use of a systematic probabilistic approach exposes design principles of miRNAs regulation toward cell states, cell identity, and the translational machinery.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298596v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>c8066dbd</fingerprint><author><name>Mahlab-Aviv, S.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298596v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523343600000</published><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162aff1ddce:1e06417:7c9981b6</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298596v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/10/298596</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523370286542</crawled></item><item><content><content>Motivation: The study of ancient genomes can elucidate the evolutionary past.

Extracted data were analyzed with STATA (version 14). The standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each indicator were calculated using a random effect model. We also performed tests of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, assessments of bias, and meta-regression in this meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 54 observational studies were included. By meta-analysis we found significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (9 studies, SMD 0.883, 95% CI 0.130 to 1.637, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 10 studies, SMD -0.133, 95% CI -0.512 to 0.246, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.429 in POCD) and interleukin (IL)-6 (7 studies, SMD 0.386, 95% CI 0.054 to 0.717, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 16 studies, SMD 0.089, 95% CI -0.133 to 0.311, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.433 in POCD) concentrations in both POD and POCD patients. We also found that the SMDs of CRP and IL-6 from POCD patients were positively correlated with surgery type in the meta-regression (CRP: Coefficient = 1.555365, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 10 studies; IL-6: Coefficient = -0.6455521, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.086, 16 studies).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Available evidence from medium-to-high quality observational studies suggests that POD and POCD are indeed correlated with the concentration of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers.

Being generally regarded as commensal bacteria, the pro-inflammatory capacity of &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma&lt;/i&gt; species has long been debated. Recently, we confirmed &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma&lt;/i&gt;–driven pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and a disturbance of cytokine equilibrium in primary human monocytes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The present study addressed the expression of CC chemokines and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in purified term neonatal and adult monocytes stimulated with serovar 8 of &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma urealyticum&lt;/i&gt; (Uu) and serovar 3 of &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parvum&lt;/i&gt; (Up). Using qRT-PCR and multi-analyte immunoassay, we assessed mRNA and protein expression of the monocyte chemotactic proteins 1 and 3 (MCP-1/3), the macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 1β (MIP-1α/β) as well as MMP-9. For the most part, both isolates stimulated mRNA expression of all given chemokines and MMP-9 in cord blood and adult monocytes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). These results were paralleled by Uu and Up-induced secretion of MCP-1 protein in both cells (neonatal: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01, adult: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). Release of MCP-3, MIP-1α, MIP-1β and MMP-9 was enhanced upon exposure to Up (neonatal: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, respectively; adult: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Co-stimulation of LPS-primed monocytes with Up increased LPS-induced MCP-1 release in neonatal cells (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) and aggravated LPS-induced MMP-9 mRNA in both cell subsets (neonatal: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, adult: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).

Background &lt;p&gt;Sleep disordered breathing is a common but often undiagnosed comorbidity in heart failure patients. Cardiac implantable electronic devices used for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may detect sleep apnea by use of a transthoracic impedance sensor.

&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria are able to grow in a planktonic state that is associated with acute infections and in biofilms that are associated with chronic infections. Acute infections, such as skin infections, are often self-limiting. However, chronic infections, such as implant infections, can be difficult to clear and may require surgical intervention. The host immune response may contribute to the different outcomes often associated with these two disease types. We used proteomic arrays and two murine models for an initial, descriptive characterization of the contribution of the host immune response to outcomes of acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; disease. We compared the immune responses between a model of self-limiting skin and soft tissue infection caused by the planktonic form of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; versus a model of surgical mesh implant infection, which we show to be caused by a bacterial biofilm. The significantly altered host cytokines and chemokines were largely different in the two models, with responses diminished by 21 days post-implantation in surgical mesh infection. Because bacterial levels remained constant during the 21 days that the surgical mesh infection was followed, those cytokines that are significantly increased during chronic infection are not likely effective in eradicating biofilm. Comparison of the levels of cytokines and chemokines in acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; infection can provide a starting point for evaluation of the role of specific immune factors that are present in one disease manifestation but not the other.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Comparison of the immune response during acute and chronic &amp;lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;lt;/i&gt; infection</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195342</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195342</originId><fingerprint>c9c56a66</fingerprint><author><name>Rebecca A.

In this study, we investigated whether the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), VCAM-1 (vascular adhesion molecule-1), E-selectin und L-selectin, which are involved in homing of vascular stem cells, are upregulated by CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells from septic patients and would be associated with improved clinical outcome. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with (n = 30) and without sepsis (n = 10), and healthy volunteers (n = 15) were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. The expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin and L-selectin was detected on CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells by flow cytometry. The severity of disease was assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II. Serum concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang)-2 were determined by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin and L-selectin by CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells was significantly upregulated in septic patients, and correlated with sepsis severity. Furthermore, high expression of VCAM-1 by CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells revealed a positive association with mortalitiy (p&amp;lt;0.05). Furthermore, significantly higher serum concentrations of VEGF and Ang-2 were found in septic patients, however none showed a strong association with survival.

Determining the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors on genetic connectivity among populations remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology and in the management and conservation of species. North Pacific hake (&lt;i&gt;Merluccius productus&lt;/i&gt;) inhabits upwelling regions in the California Current ecosystem from the Gulf of California to the Gulf of Alaska. In this study, we examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite variation to estimate levels of genetic differentiation of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;productus&lt;/i&gt; in relation to the role of oceanographic features as potential barriers to gene flow. Samples were obtained from nine sites spanning a large part of the geographic range of the species, from Puget Sound, Washington to Costa Rica. The microsatellite results revealed three genetically discrete populations: one spanning the eastern Pacific coast, and two apparently resident populations circumscribed to the Puget Sound and the northern Gulf of California (F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.032, p = 0.036). Cytochrome b sequence data indicated that isolation between the Puget Sound and northern Gulf of California populations from the coastal Pacific were recent phenomena (18.5 kyr for Puget Sound and 40 kyr for the northern Gulf of California). Oceanographic data obtained from the Gulf of California support the hypothesis that permanent fronts within the region, and strong gradients at the entrance to the Gulf of California act as barriers to gene flow. A seascape genetics approach found significant genetic–environment associations, where the daytime sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentrations were the best predictive variables for the observed genetic differentiation. Considering the potential causes of genetic isolation among the three populations, e.g. spawning areas in different latitudes associated with upwelling processes, oceanographic barriers, asymmetric migration and specialized diet, oceanographic barriers appear to be a likely mechanism restricting gene flow.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Role of oceanography in shaping the genetic structure in the North Pacific hake &amp;lt;i&gt;Merluccius productus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194646</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194646</originId><fingerprint>aef9a238</fingerprint><author><name>Francisco Javier García-De León</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194646</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5ec:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francisco Javier García-De León, Carolina Galván-Tirado, Laura Sánchez Velasco, Claudia A.

Many fossil specimens exhibit deformations caused by taphonomic processes. Due to these deformations, even important specimens have to be excluded from morphometric analyses, impoverishing an already poor paleontological record. Techniques to retrodeform and virtually restore damaged (i.e. deformed) specimens are available, but these methods genenerally imply the use of a sparse set of bilateral landmarks, ignoring the fact that the distribution and amount of control points directly affects the result of the retrodeformation. We propose a method developed in the R environment and available in the R-package “Morpho” that, in addition to the landmark configurations, also allows using a set of semi-landmarks homogeneously distributed along curves and on surfaces. We evaluated the outcome of the retrodeformation, regarding the number of semi-landmarks used and its robustness against asymmetric noise, based on simulations using a virtually deformed gorilla cranium. Finally, we applied the method to a well-known Neanderthal cranium that exhibits signs of taphonomically induced asymmetry.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Retrodeformation of fossil specimens based on 3D bilateral semi-landmarks: Implementation in the R package “Morpho”</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</originId><fingerprint>eedb143f</fingerprint><author><name>Stefan Schlager</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521493200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88eb:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Schlager, Antonio Profico, Fabio Di Vincenzo, Giorgio Manzi&lt;/p&gt;

Sunscreen users are often inadequately protected and become sunburned. This study aimed to investigate how much two consecutive sunscreen applications increased the quantity of sunscreen applied and decreased the skin area left without sunscreen (missed area) compared to a single application. Thirty-one healthy volunteers wearing swimwear were included and applied sunscreen two consecutive times in a laboratory environment. Participants had pictures taken in black light before and after each application. As sunscreens absorb black light, the darkness of the skin increased with increasing amounts of sunscreen applied. We conducted a standard curve establishing a link between change in picture darkness and quantity of sunscreen. The quantity of sunscreen at selected skin sites as well as the percentage of missed area was determined after each application. Participants had missed a median of 20% of their available body surface after a single application. After double application they had missed 9%. The decrease in missed areas was significant for the whole body surface and for each of the body regions separately. The median participant had applied between 13% and 100% more sunscreen at the selected skin sites after double application than after single application. We recommend double application, especially before intense sun exposure.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Sunscreen use optimized by two consecutive applications</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193916</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193916</originId><fingerprint>ad78f125</fingerprint><author><name>Ida M.

Diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon, &lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&lt;/i&gt; were fed high-protein, phosphorus-rich diets (56–60% protein; ca 18g phosphorus kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; diet) whilst being reared at low temperature from start-feeding until parr-smolt transformation. Performances of salmon fed diets based on fish meal (STD) or a mix of fishmeal and hydrolysed fish proteins (HFM) as the major protein sources were compared in terms of mortality, diet digestibility, growth and skeletal deformities. Separate groups of diploids and triploids were reared in triplicate tanks (initially 3000 fish per tank; tank biomass ca. 620 g) from 0–2745 degree-days post-start feeding (ddPSF). Growth metrics (weight, length, condition factor) were recorded at ca. 4 week intervals, external signs of deformities to the operculum, jaws and spinal column were examined in parr sampled at 1390 ddPSF, and external signs of deformity and vertebral anomalies (by radiography) were examined in fish sampled at the end of the trial (2745 ddPSF). The triploid salmon generally had a lower mass per unit length, i.e. lower condition factor, throughout the trial, but this did not seem to reflect any consistent dietary or ploidy effects on either dietary digestibility or the growth of the fish. By the end of the trial fish in all treatment groups had achieved a weight of 50+ g, and had completed the parr-smolt transformation. The triploids had slightly, but significantly, fewer vertebrae (Triploids STD 58.74 ± 0.10; HFM 58.68 ± 0.05) than the diploids (Diploids STD 58.97 ± 0.14; HFM 58.89 ± 0.01), and the incidence of skeletal (vertebral) abnormalities was higher in triploids (Triploids STD 31 ± 0.90%; HFM 15 ± 1.44%) than in diploids (Diploids STD 4 ± 0.80%; HFM 4 ± 0.83%). The HFM diet gave a significant reduction in the numbers of triploid salmon with vertebral anomalies in comparison with the triploids fed the STD diet possibly as a result of differences in phosphorus bioavailability between the two diets. Overall, the incidence of skeletal deformities was lower than reported in previous studies (Diploids 20+%, Triploids 40+%), possibly as a result of the combination of rearing at low-temperature and phosphorus-rich diets being used in the present study.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Growth and development of skeletal anomalies in diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon (&amp;lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&amp;lt;/i&gt;) fed phosphorus-rich diets with fish meal and hydrolyzed fish protein</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194340</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194340</originId><fingerprint>e03b8fb2</fingerprint><author><name>Stefano Peruzzi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194340</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:412391f:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefano Peruzzi, Velmurugu Puvanendran, Guido Riesen, Rudi Ripman Seim, Ørjan Hagen, Silvia Martínez-Llorens, Inger-Britt Falk-Petersen, Jorge M.

The triploid salmon generally had a lower mass per unit length, i.e. lower condition factor, throughout the trial, but this did not seem to reflect any consistent dietary or ploidy effects on either dietary digestibility or the growth of the fish. By the end of the trial fish in all treatment groups had achieved a weight of 50+ g, and had completed the parr-smolt transformation. The triploids had slightly, but significantly, fewer vertebrae (Triploids STD 58.74 ± 0.10; HFM 58.68 ± 0.05) than the diploids (Diploids STD 58.97 ± 0.14; HFM 58.89 ± 0.01), and the incidence of skeletal (vertebral) abnormalities was higher in triploids (Triploids STD 31 ± 0.90%; HFM 15 ± 1.44%) than in diploids (Diploids STD 4 ± 0.80%; HFM 4 ± 0.83%). The HFM diet gave a significant reduction in the numbers of triploid salmon with vertebral anomalies in comparison with the triploids fed the STD diet possibly as a result of differences in phosphorus bioavailability between the two diets. Overall, the incidence of skeletal deformities was lower than reported in previous studies (Diploids 20+%, Triploids 40+%), possibly as a result of the combination of rearing at low-temperature and phosphorus-rich diets being used in the present study.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194340</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521740721801</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>CO oxidation on Ru–Pt bimetallic nanoclusters supported on TiO2(101): The effect of charge polarization</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021712?af=R</originId><fingerprint>8a332231</fingerprint><author><name>Chuanyi Jia</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021712?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1521694813000</published><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88e7:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021712?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522221443430</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas K.

The development of models of macromolecular electrostatics capable of delivering improved fidelity to quantum mechanical calculations is an active field of research in computational chemistry. Most molecular force field development takes place in the context of models with full Cartesian coordinate degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, a number of macromolecular modeling programs use a reduced set of conformational variables limited to rotatable bonds. Efficient algorithms for minimizing the energies of macromolecular systems with torsional degrees of freedom have been developed with the assumption that all atom-atom interaction potentials are isotropic. We describe novel modifications to address the anisotropy of higher order multipole terms while retaining the efficiency of these approaches. In addition, we present a treatment for obtaining derivatives of atom-centered tensors with respect to torsional degrees of freedom. We apply these results to enable minimization of the Amoeba multipole electrostatics potential in a system with torsional degrees of freedom, and validate the correctness of the gradients by comparison to finite difference approximations. In the interest of enabling a complete model of electrostatics with implicit treatment of solvent-mediated effects, we also derive expressions for the derivative of solvent accessible surface area with respect to torsional degrees of freedom.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Efficient minimization of multipole electrostatic potentials in torsion space</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195578</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195578</originId><fingerprint>1535c7db</fingerprint><author><name>Nicholas K.

British &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; complex [&lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato) mosquito distribution, abundance, and potential for disease transmission are intimately linked to their environment. Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. &lt;i&gt;Culex (&lt;/i&gt;mostly &lt;i&gt;pipiens)&lt;/i&gt; is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught &lt;i&gt;Cx pipiens&lt;/i&gt;. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The effect of pond dyes on oviposition and survival in wild UK &amp;lt;i&gt;Culex&amp;lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</originId><fingerprint>38533848</fingerprint><author><name>Natali Ortiz-Perea</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193847</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2804:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natali Ortiz-Perea, Rebecca Gander, Oliver Abbey, Amanda Callaghan&lt;/p&gt;

In health sector, trust is considered important because it indirectly influences the quality of health care through patient satisfaction, adherence and the continuity of its relationship with health care professionals and the promotion of accurate and timely diagnoses. One of the important requirements of TRSs in the health sector is rating secrecy, which mandates that the identification information about the service consumer should be kept secret to prevent any privacy violation. Anonymity and trust are two imperative objectives, and no significant explicit efforts have been made to achieve both of them at the same time. In this paper, we present a framework for solving the problem of reconciling trust with anonymity in the health sector. Our solution comprises Anonymous &lt;i&gt;Reputation Management&lt;/i&gt; (ARM) protocol and &lt;i&gt;Context-aware Trustworthiness Assessment&lt;/i&gt; (CTA) protocol. ARM protocol ensures that only those service consumers who received a service from a specific service provider provide a recommendation score anonymously with in the specified time limit. The CTA protocol computes the reputation of a user as a service provider and as a recommender. To determine the correctness of the proposed ARM protocol, formal modelling and verification are performed using High Level Petri Nets (HLPN) and Z3 Solver.

Anti-drug antibody formation occurs with most biological agents across disease states, but the mechanism by which they are formed is unknown. The formation of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab (AAA) may decrease its therapeutic effects in some patients. HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with autoantibody formation against interferons and other TNF inhibitors, but not adalimumab. We analyzed samples from 634 subjects with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS): 37 subjects (17 RA and 20 HS) developed AAA (AAA+) during adalimumab treatment and 597 subjects (348 RA, 249 HS) did not develop AAA (AAA-) during the clinical trials. Using next-generation sequencing-based HLA typing, we identified three protective HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1*05, HLA-DRB1*01,and HLA-DRB1*07) that were less prevalent in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 0.4, 0.25 and 0.28, respectively; and P values: 0.012, 0.012 and 0.018, respectively) and two risk HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*011) that were more abundant in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 2.52, and 2.64, respectively; and P values: 0.006 and 0.019). Similar to the finding of Billiet &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. who found that carriage of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was more prevalent in those with anti-infliximab antibodies (OR = 3.6, p = 0.002, 95% CI: [1.5,8.6]).), we found HLA-DRB1*03 allele was also more prevalent in anti-adalimumab positive (OR = 2.52, p = 0.006, 95% CI: [1.37,4.63]). The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Identification of HLA-DRB1 association to adalimumab immunogenicity</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195325</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195325</originId><fingerprint>e08b35e8</fingerprint><author><name>Mohan Liu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195325</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522789200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f66:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohan Liu, Jacob Degner, Justin Wade Davis, Kenneth B.

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of 26–28 genes at chromosome band 7q11.23. The complete deletion (CD) mouse model mimics the most common deletion found in WBS patients and recapitulates most neurologic features of the disorder along with some cardiovascular manifestations leading to significant cardiac hypertrophy with increased cardiomyocytes’ size. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin found in green tea, has been associated with potential health benefits, both on cognition and cardiovascular phenotypes, through several mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of green tea extracts on WBS-related phenotypes through a phase I clinical trial in mice. After feeding CD animals with green tea extracts dissolved in the drinking water, starting at three different time periods (prenatal, youth and adulthood), a set of behavioral tests and several anatomical, histological and molecular analyses were performed. Treatment resulted to be effective in the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and was also able to ameliorate short-term memory deficits of CD mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EGCG might have a therapeutic and/or preventive role in the management of WBS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Epigallocatechin-3-gallate improves cardiac hypertrophy and short-term memory deficits in a Williams-Beuren syndrome mouse model</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194476</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194476</originId><fingerprint>b6faf5d3</fingerprint><author><name>Paula Ortiz-Romero</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194476</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521493200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fc:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paula Ortiz-Romero, Cristina Borralleras, Mònica Bosch-Morató, Biuse Guivernau, Guillermo Albericio, Francisco J.

Fungal communities in agricultural soils are assumed to be affected by soil and crop management. Our intention was to investigate the impact of different tillage and fertilization practices on fungal communities in a long-term crop rotation field trial established in 1992 in Central Germany. Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. conservation tillage, intensive &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (&lt;i&gt;Basidio&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Asco&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Zygo&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Glomero&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/i&gt;), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) substantiated the results and proved significant influences of tillage and pre-crop, while fertilization had the smallest and non-significant effect. In-depth analysis of putative phytopathogenic and plant beneficial fungal groups indicated distinct responses; for example &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; was significantly enriched in the intensively fertilized conservation tillage variants with the pre-crop maize, while &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt; displayed significant association with conventional tillage and pre-crop rapeseed.

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A mechanistic pan-cancer pathway model informed by multi-omics data interprets stochastic cell fate responses to drugs and mitogens</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</link><recrawled>1522095842894</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</originId><fingerprint>f0df1a15</fingerprint><author><name>Mehdi Bouhaddou</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/w6d_RFwOJFE/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b6:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; formation of epithelial cell-cell contacts relies on actin-based protrusions as well as tightly controlled turnover of junctional actin once cells encounter each other and adhesion complexes assemble. The specific contributions of individual actin regulators on either protrusion formation or junctional actin turnover remain largely unexplored. Based on our previous findings of Formin-like 2 (FMNL2)-mediated control of junctional actin dynamics, we investigated its potential role in membrane protrusions and impact on newly forming epithelial contacts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of FMNL2 in human MCF10A cells combined with optogenetic control of Rac1 activity confirmed its critical function in the establishment of intercellular contacts. While lamellipodial protrusion rates remained unaffected, FMNL2 knockout cells were characterized by impaired filopodia formation similar to depletion of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Silencing of Cdc42, however, failed to affect FMNL2-mediated contact formation. Hence, we propose a cell-cell contact-specific and Rac1-mediated function of FMNL2 entirely independent of Cdc42. Consistent with this, direct visualizations of native epithelial junction formation revealed a striking and specifically Rac1- and not Cdc42-dependent recruitment of FMNL2 to newly forming junctions as well as established cell-cell contacts within epithelial sheets.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A Rac1-FMNL2 signaling module affects cell-cell contact formation independent of Cdc42 and membrane protrusions</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</originId><fingerprint>f712f6c3</fingerprint><author><name>Hanna Grobe</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f3:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Grobe, Andrea Wüstenhagen, Christian Baarlink, Robert Grosse, Katharina Grikscheit&lt;/p&gt;

In tropical and subtropical lakes, eutrophication often leads to nuisance blooms of &lt;i&gt;Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii&lt;/i&gt;. In laboratory experiments, we tested the combined effects of flocculant polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB) on the sinking and growth rates of three &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of PAC and LMB would (1) effectively sink &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; in a test tube experiment and (2) impair &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; growth, irrespective of the biomass of the inoculum (bloom) and the strain in the growth experiment. We tested the recommended (LMB1) and a three-times higher dose of LMB (LMB3). The combined addition of PAC and LMB enhanced the sedimentation of all &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. Moreover, both the PAC and LMB doses decreased the phosphate concentration. PAC and LMB1 decreased the growth rate of all strains, but the efficacy depended on the biomass and strain. The combined addition of PAC and LMB3 inhibited the growth of all strains independently of the biomass and strain. We conclude that a low dose of PAC in combination with the recommended dose of LMB decreases &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms and that the efficiency of the technique depends on the biomass of the bloom.

In laboratory experiments, we tested the combined effects of flocculant polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB) on the sinking and growth rates of three &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of PAC and LMB would (1) effectively sink &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; in a test tube experiment and (2) impair &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; growth, irrespective of the biomass of the inoculum (bloom) and the strain in the growth experiment. We tested the recommended (LMB1) and a three-times higher dose of LMB (LMB3). The combined addition of PAC and LMB enhanced the sedimentation of all &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. Moreover, both the PAC and LMB doses decreased the phosphate concentration. PAC and LMB1 decreased the growth rate of all strains, but the efficacy depended on the biomass and strain. The combined addition of PAC and LMB3 inhibited the growth of all strains independently of the biomass and strain. We conclude that a low dose of PAC in combination with the recommended dose of LMB decreases &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms and that the efficiency of the technique depends on the biomass of the bloom. A higher dose of LMB is needed to obtain a more efficient control of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195359</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;BCL3-PVRL&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;i&gt;-TOMM40&lt;/i&gt;

The PgdS enzyme is a poly-γ-glutamic (γ-PGA) hydrolase, which has potential application for a controllable degradation of γ-PGA by enzymatic depolymerization; however, the structure of PgdS is still unknown. Here, to study in detail the full-length PgdS structure, we analyze the low-resolution architecture of PgdS hydrolase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; in solution using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) method. Combining with other methods, like dynamic light scattering and mutagenesis analyses, a model for the full length structure and the possible substrate delivery route of PgdS are proposed. The results will provide useful hints for future investigations into the mechanisms of γ-PGA degradation by the PgdS hydrolase and may provide valuable practical information.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Solution scattering study of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&amp;lt;/i&gt; PgdS enzyme involved in poly-γ-glutamic acids degradation</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195355</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195355</originId><fingerprint>232224db</fingerprint><author><name>Jumei Zeng</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195355</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522702800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76937:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jumei Zeng, Yun Jin, Zhongchuan Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing architectures with many interconnections of simple neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets, Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

Several studies suggest that low birthweight resulting from restricted intrauterine growth can leave a metabolic footprint which may persist into adulthood. To investigate this, we performed metabolomic profiling on 5036 female twins, aged 18–80, with weight at birth information available from the TwinsUK cohort and performed independent replication in two additional cohorts. Out of 422 compounds tested, 25 metabolites associated with birthweight in these twins, replicated in 1951 men and women from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS, aged 66) and in 2391 men and women from the North Finland Birth 1986 cohort (NFBC, aged 16). We found distinct heterogeneity between sexes and, after adjusting for multiple tests and heterogeneity, two metabolites were reproducible overall (propionylcarnitine and 3-4-hydroxyphenyllactate). Testing women only, we found other metabolites associated with lower birthweight from the meta-analysis of the three cohorts (2-hydroxy-butyric acid and γ-glutamylleucine). Higher levels of all these metabolites can be linked to insulin resistance, oxidative stress or a dysfunction of energy metabolism, suggesting that low birthweight in both twins and singletons are having an impact on these pathways in adulthood.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Metabolomic signatures of low birthweight: Pathways to insulin resistance and oxidative stress</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194316</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194316</originId><fingerprint>eb11472a</fingerprint><author><name>Sarah Jane Metrustry</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194316</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:412391d:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah Jane Metrustry, Ville Karhunen, Mark H.

The goal of this study was to objectively assess the effect of a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivate in English bulldogs with stifle degenerative joint disease secondary to cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR). We used a force platform and affixed electrogoniometers to measure peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), stance time (ST), and angular range of motion (AROM), from 12 lame client-owned English bulldogs with post-CCLR stifle joint abnormalities. The 12 affected subjects were treated with 4 intra-articular injections of PRP, at 30-day intervals. Ten untreated, sound English bulldogs were used as a reference group. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using a linear mixed effects model. Mean values of PVF, VI, ST, and AROM were improved within the first 3 months post-treatment in the CCLR group, with mean measured changes increasing to maximum 4.56% body weight gain, 1.5% body weight/second, 0.07 seconds, and 6.18 degrees, respectively. The effects declined progressively after the treatment interval, ending at nearly initial levels after 6 months. This study demonstrates that dogs with CCLR treated with intra-articular PRP had improved PVF, VI, ST, and AROM over time; the duration of effect was waning by the end of the post-treatment period.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Effect of leukocyte-reduced platelet-rich plasma on osteoarthritis caused by cranial cruciate ligament rupture: A canine gait analysis model</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194752</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194752</originId><fingerprint>8ba76de2</fingerprint><author><name>José M.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale Drop-seq dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale Drop-seq dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods. In the case study applied to in-house Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) scRNA-seq data, scVDMC revealed several new cell types and unknown markers validated by flow cytometry.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is not well understood at the molecular level. Exactly why some brain regions produce epileptic discharges and others do not is not known. Patients who fail to respond to antiseizure medication (refractory epilepsy) can benefit from surgical removal of brain regions to reduce seizure frequency. The tissue removed in these surgeries offers an invaluable resource to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of human epilepsy. Here, we report a proteomic study to determine whether there are common proteomic patterns in human brain regions that produce epileptic discharges. We analyzed human brain samples, as part of the Systems Biology of Epilepsy Project (SBEP). These brain pieces are &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized human brain samples withdrawn from the neocortex of six patients with refractory epilepsy. This study is unique in that for each of these six patients the comparison of protein expression was made within the same patient: a more epileptic region was compared to a less epileptic brain region. The amount of epileptic activity was defined for each patient as the frequency of their interictal spikes (electric activity between seizures that is a parameter strongly linked to epilepsy). Proteins were resolved from three subcellular fractions, using a 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), revealing 31 identified protein spots that changed significantly. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was found to be consistently down regulated in high spiking brain tissue and showed a strong negative correlation with spike frequency. We also developed a two-step analysis method to select for protein species that changed frequently among the patients and identified these proteins. A total of 397 protein spots of interest (SOI) were clustered by protein expression patterns across all samples. These clusters were used as markers and this analysis predicted proteomic changes due to both histological differences and molecular pathways, revealed by examination of gene ontology clusters. Our experimental design and proteomic data analysis predicts novel glial changes, increased angiogenesis, and changes in cytoskeleton and neuronal projections between high and low interictal spiking regions. Quantitative histological staining of these same tissues for both the vascular and glial changes confirmed these findings, which provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Proteomic analysis of human epileptic neocortex predicts vascular and glial changes in epileptic regions</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</originId><fingerprint>6cf59a96</fingerprint><author><name>Gal Keren-Aviram</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523394000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9ba:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gal Keren-Aviram, Fabien Dachet, Shruti Bagla, Karina Balan, Jeffrey A.

The study of visual perception has largely been completed without regard to the influence that an individual’s emotional status may have on their performance in visual tasks. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that mood may affect not only creative abilities and interpersonal skills but also the capacity to perform low-level cognitive tasks. Here, we sought to determine whether rudimentary visual search processes are similarly affected by emotion. Specifically, we examined whether an individual’s perceived happiness level affects their ability to detect a target in noise. To do so, we employed pop-out and serial visual search paradigms, implemented using a novel smartphone application that allowed search times and self-rated levels of happiness to be recorded throughout each twenty-four-hour period for two weeks. This experience sampling protocol circumvented the need to alter mood artificially with laboratory-based induction methods. Using our smartphone application, we were able to replicate the classic visual search findings, whereby pop-out search times remained largely unaffected by the number of distractors whereas serial search times increased with increasing number of distractors. While pop-out search times were unaffected by happiness level, serial search times with the maximum numbers of distractors (n = 30) were significantly faster for high happiness levels than low happiness levels (p = 0.02). Our results demonstrate the utility of smartphone applications in assessing ecologically valid measures of human visual performance. We discuss the significance of our findings for the assessment of basic visual functions using search time measures, and for our ability to search effectively for targets in real world settings.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The effect of mood state on visual search times for detecting a target in noise: An application of smartphone technology</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</originId><fingerprint>1ceb0ce8</fingerprint><author><name>Toru Maekawa</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523998800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344158:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Toru Maekawa, Stephen J.

We discuss the significance of our findings for the assessment of basic visual functions using search time measures, and for our ability to search effectively for targets in real world settings.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523998800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523986744698</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Current density tensors</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025046?af=R</originId><fingerprint>937ed02e</fingerprint><author><name>Paolo Lazzeretti</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025046?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522735279000</published><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b3b:7c9981b6</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025046?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523085743269</crawled></item><item><title>Directional selectivity of afferent neurons in zebrafish neuromasts is regulated by Emx2 in presynaptic hair cells</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><description>The orientation of hair bundles on top of sensory hair cells (HCs) in neuromasts of the lateral line system allows fish to detect direction of water flow.

In face-to-face social interactions, blind and visually impaired persons (VIPs) lack access to nonverbal cues like facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, which may lead to impaired interpersonal communication. In this study, a wearable sensory substitution device (SSD) consisting of a head mounted camera and a haptic belt was evaluated to determine whether vibrotactile cues around the waist could be used to convey facial expressions to users and whether such a device is desired by VIPs for use in daily living situations. Ten VIPs (mean age: 38.8, SD: 14.4) and 10 sighted persons (SPs) (mean age: 44.5, SD: 19.6) participated in the study, in which validated sets of pictures, silent videos, and videos with audio of facial expressions were presented to the participant. A control measurement was first performed to determine how accurately participants could identify facial expressions while relying on their functional senses. After a short training, participants were asked to determine facial expressions while wearing the emotion feedback system. VIPs using the device showed significant improvements in their ability to determine which facial expressions were shown. A significant increase in accuracy of 44.4% was found across all types of stimuli when comparing the scores of the control (mean±SEM: 35.0±2.5%) and supported (mean±SEM: 79.4±2.1%) phases. The greatest improvements achieved with the support of the SSD were found for silent stimuli (68.3% for pictures and 50.8% for silent videos). SPs also showed consistent, though not statistically significant, improvements while supported. Overall, our study shows that vibrotactile cues are well suited to convey facial expressions to VIPs in real-time. Participants became skilled with the device after a short training session. Further testing and development of the SSD is required to improve its accuracy and aesthetics for potential daily use.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Conveying facial expressions to blind and visually impaired persons through a wearable vibrotactile device</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194737</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194737</originId><fingerprint>c0ef7590</fingerprint><author><name>Hendrik P.

Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused great public concerns due to its recent large outbreaks and a close association with microcephaly in fetus and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Rapid development of vaccines against ZIKV is a public health priority. To this end, we have constructed and purified recombinant ZIKV envelope protein using both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, and then tested their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in immune competent mice. Both protein immunogens elicited humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immune competent mice from ZIKV challenge &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These products could be further evaluated either as stand-alone vaccine candidate, or used in a prime-and-boost regimen with other forms of ZIKV vaccine.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Recombinant Zika virus envelope protein elicited protective immunity against Zika virus in immunocompetent mice</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</originId><fingerprint>5750fff5</fingerprint><author><name>Huabin Liang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4243:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huabin Liang, Ruoheng Yang, Zhihua Liu, Min Li, Haitao Liu, Xia Jin&lt;/p&gt;

Assessment of researchers is necessary for decisions of hiring, promotion, and tenure. A burgeoning number of scientific leaders believe the current system of faculty incentives and rewards is misaligned with the needs of society and disconnected from the evidence about the causes of the reproducibility crisis and suboptimal quality of the scientific publication record. To address this issue, particularly for the clinical and life sciences, we convened a 22-member expert panel workshop in Washington, DC, in January 2017. Twenty-two academic leaders, funders, and scientists participated in the meeting. As background for the meeting, we completed a selective literature review of 22 key documents critiquing the current incentive system. From each document, we extracted how the authors perceived the problems of assessing science and scientists, the unintended consequences of maintaining the status quo for assessing scientists, and details of their proposed solutions. The resulting table was used as a seed for participant discussion. This resulted in six principles for assessing scientists and associated research and policy implications. We hope the content of this paper will serve as a basis for establishing best practices and redesigning the current approaches to assessing scientists by the many players involved in that process.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oSr6VqA7_WQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Assessing scientists for hiring, promotion, and tenure</title><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004089</link><recrawled>1522347665017</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004089</originId><fingerprint>f8091ef9</fingerprint><author><name>David Moher</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/oSr6VqA7_WQ/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16272e5d344:b6d4a:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Moher, Florian Naudet, Ioana A.

Transgenic rat models of Alzheimer’s disease were used to examine differences in memory and brain histology. Double transgenic female rats (APP+PS1) over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and single transgenic rats (APP21) over-expressing human APP were compared with wild type Fischer rats (WT). The Barnes maze assessed learning and memory and showed that both APP21 and APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors than the WT rats during the acquisition phase, signifying slower learning. Additionally, the APP+PS1 rats made significantly more errors following a retention interval, indicating impaired memory compared to both the APP21 and WT rats. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against amyloid-β (Aβ) showed extensive and mostly diffuse Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and dense plaques that contained tau in the cortex of the brains of the APP+PS1 rats. Furthermore, the APP+PS1 rats also showed vascular changes, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy with extensive Aβ deposits in cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessel walls and venous collagenosis. In addition to the Aβ accumulation observed in arterial, venous, and capillary walls, APP+PS1 rats also displayed enlarged blood vessels and perivascular space. Overall, the brain histopathology and behavioral assessment showed that the APP+PS1 rats demonstrated behavioral characteristics and vascular changes similar to those commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Memory deficiency, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and amyloid-β plaques in APP+PS1 double transgenic rat model of Alzheimer’s disease</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</originId><fingerprint>82314836</fingerprint><author><name>Diana Klakotskaia</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195469</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523480400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd8e:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Klakotskaia, Cansu Agca, Rachel A.

Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The farm cost of decreasing antimicrobial use in dairy production</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</originId><fingerprint>97dca45</fingerprint><author><name>Guillaume Lhermie</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b9:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Lhermie, Loren William Tauer, Yrjo Tapio Gröhn&lt;/p&gt;

The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194832</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521741783044</crawled></item><item><title>Writing a cell&apos;s history in its DNA</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-j?rss=1</originId><keywords><item>Molecular Biology</item></keywords><fingerprint>e8550af1</fingerprint><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-j?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523554636000</published><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:feced7:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/166.10.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-j?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Doris H.

Anemia commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The management of patients with anemia in CKD is challenging, due to its severity, frequent hypo-responsiveness to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) and common hemoglobin cycling. Nonlinear dose-response curves and long delays in the effect of treatment on red blood cell population size complicate predictions of hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in individual patients. A comprehensive physiology based mathematical model for erythropoiesis was adapted individually to 60 hemodialysis patients treated with ESAs by identifying physiologically meaningful key model parameters from temporal Hgb data. Crit-Line&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; III monitors provided non-invasive Hgb measurements for every hemodialysis treatment. We used Hgb data during a 150-day baseline period together to estimate a patient’s individual red blood cell lifespan, effects of the ESA on proliferation of red cell progenitor cells, endogenous erythropoietin production and ESA half-life. Estimated patient specific parameters showed excellent alignment with previously conducted clinical studies in hemodialysis patients. Further, the model qualitatively and quantitatively reflected empirical hemoglobin dynamics in demographically, anthropometrically and clinically diverse patients and accurately predicted the Hgb response to ESA therapy in individual patients for up to 21 weeks. The findings suggest that estimated model parameters can be used as a proxy for parameters that are clinically very difficult to quantify. The presented method has the potential to provide new insights into the individual pathophysiology of renal anemia and its association with clinical outcomes and can potentially be used to guide personalized anemia treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Prediction of hemoglobin levels in individual hemodialysis patients by means of a mathematical model of erythropoiesis</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195918</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195918</originId><fingerprint>43effe27</fingerprint><author><name>Doris H.

It is an absolute requirement that every time you write about graphene that you mention that the breakthrough in its isolation came from the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0218/230218-graphene-sticky-tape&quot;&gt;adhesive tape&lt;/a&gt;, a low-tech insight at Manchester that led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/&quot;&gt;Nobel&lt;/a&gt; and kicked off a massive field of research. The latest is that earlier this month, a group at MIT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that if you bring two graphene sheets together, parallel but at a slightly different rotational angle (about 1.1 degrees), that the system becomes a superconductor at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was already unexpected, but the behavior of the material (electron density versus temperature) suggests some real similarities to the copper-oxide &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductivity&quot;&gt;high-temperature superconductors&lt;/a&gt;, and no one saw that coming, either. (Note that “high temperature”, in this field, still means “can be reached in liquid nitrogen as opposed to liquid helium”). Despite a really impressive amount of theoretical and experimental work on the cuprate materials, the full details of their superconductivity are still a matter of debate. It seems to come down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair&quot;&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt; (as with the classic low-temperature superconductors, but the mechanism of the electron pairing is different and in ways that still start arguments. This new graphene systems might be able to shed some light on the various proposals, and you can be certain that a great deal of late-night coffee has been consumed in recent weeks to come up with appropriate experiments along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical value of such an understanding could well be huge (and there is, of course, another near-certain Nobel in physics waiting for whoever puts the field on a firmer basis). To give another recent MIT-related example, new superconductor engineering is at the heart of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-newly-formed-company-launch-novel-approach-fusion-power-0309&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; the university made about fusion power. The belief is that large-bore magnets of such materials, which now appear feasible, could allow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak&quot;&gt;tokamak&lt;/a&gt;-design fusion reactor that is far more compact than any previous attempts. Wrestling with the magnets is one of the biggest problems in designing such machines, because you need extremely strong, extremely homogeneous fields. The high-temperature superconductors were recognized early on as having great possibilities in this area, but the first fusion reactor that used only these materials only became operational in 2014 (a spherical tokamak design at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tokamakenergy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Tokamak Energy&lt;/a&gt; in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphene-layer materials are still operating at very low temperatures – but considering their electron density, it’s actually a lot higher than it should be. No one is going to be make fusion reactors with twisted-graphite magnets any time soon, but twisted graphite might possibly be the platform that leads us to the magnets that fusion reactors will use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Graphene Continues to Surprise</title><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><description>I wanted to mention something on the border between chemistry and physics that might well turn out to be important.

The most frequently used drugs were cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, and psychotropics. By excluding the ten most frequently used drug classes or compounds, the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced by 69% and 51% respectively.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To establish reference values for hand grip strength (HGS) in a healthy Korean population and to identify the dependent anthropometric variables that affect HGS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2014 to 2015, we analyzed the HGS data of 7,969 South Koreans. Individuals with specific chronic diseases and who reported poor subjective health status were excluded to ensure a healthy population sample. Means with standard deviations (SDs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each 5-year interval starting from 10 years of age. To determine the relationship between HGS and anthropometric variables, we performed correlation analyses between HGS and height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Additionally, based on these findings, the cut-off value for low HGS was presented by deriving -2SD values of healthy young adults as recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean age and BMI of men and women were 38.3 and 38.2 years and 23.8 and 22.4 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Mean HGS of the dominant hand in men and women was 39.5 and 24.2 kg, respectively. The peak in HGS was at 35–39 years of age, after which HGS decreased in both sexes. HGS was significantly correlated with height, weight, and BMI. The cut-off values for weak HGS were &amp;lt; 28.9 and &amp;lt; 16.8 kg in men and women, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results provide useful reference values to assess HGS in patients who undergo hand surgery or who have various diseases that affect HGS.

The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular and respiratory effects of two volumes of bupivacaine 0.25% (0.2 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—treatment BUP02—and 0.4 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; –treatment BUP04) administered epidurally at the lumbosacral intervertebral space in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane. This experimental prospective randomized crossover design trial used six mixed breed adult dogs, four neutered males and two spayed females. Each dog was anesthetized on three different occasions: the first for isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) measurement, and the following two assigned treatments (BUP02 or BUP04). On the two treatment days, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane at 1.3 MAC during the experiments. Cardiovascular and respiratory measurements were recorded before (T0) and 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the epidural administration of bupivacaine. Comparisons between and within groups were performed by a mixed-model ANOVA and Friedman’s test when appropriate followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test or Dunnet’s test to compare time points within each treatment with T0 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly from 15 to 90 minutes after the administration of BUP02 and from 5 to 60 minutes in BUP04, with lower values in BUP04 than in BUP02 lasting up to 30 minutes after bupivacaine administration.

The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular and respiratory effects of two volumes of bupivacaine 0.25% (0.2 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—treatment BUP02—and 0.4 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; –treatment BUP04) administered epidurally at the lumbosacral intervertebral space in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane. This experimental prospective randomized crossover design trial used six mixed breed adult dogs, four neutered males and two spayed females. Each dog was anesthetized on three different occasions: the first for isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) measurement, and the following two assigned treatments (BUP02 or BUP04). On the two treatment days, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane at 1.3 MAC during the experiments. Cardiovascular and respiratory measurements were recorded before (T0) and 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the epidural administration of bupivacaine. Comparisons between and within groups were performed by a mixed-model ANOVA and Friedman’s test when appropriate followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test or Dunnet’s test to compare time points within each treatment with T0 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly from 15 to 90 minutes after the administration of BUP02 and from 5 to 60 minutes in BUP04, with lower values in BUP04 than in BUP02 lasting up to 30 minutes after bupivacaine administration. No significant changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were observed in either treatment. Hypoventilation was only detected in BUP04. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial oxygen content decreased after both treatment of bupivacaine with no significant decrease in oxygen delivery. Two dogs in BUP04 developed Horner’s syndrome. The epidural administration of 0.4 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of bupivacaine to dogs in sternal recumbency anesthetized with isoflurane 1.3 MAC caused more cardiovascular and respiratory depression than 0.2 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1524085200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195867</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524074227579</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wenyi Li, Xujun Luo, Zhongyue Liu, Yanqiao Chen, Zhihong Li&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of retrospective studies that investigated the association of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with the overall survival (OS) of patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A detailed literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed databases up to August 28, 2017, for related research publications written in English. We extracted the data from these studies and combined the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the correlation between CRP levels and OS in patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five studies with a total of 816 participants from several countries were enrolled in this current meta-analysis. In a pooled analysis of all the publications, increased serum CRP levels had an adverse prognostic effect on the overall survival of patients with bone neoplasms. However, the combined data showed no significant relationship between the level of CRP and OS in Asian patients (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.86–3.49; P = 0.125). Similar trends were observed in patients with bone neoplasms when stratified by ethnicity, histology, metastasis and study sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The results of this meta-analysis suggest that increased CRP expression indicates a poorer prognosis in patients with bone neoplasms.

Here we demonstrate the application of a method that could accelerate the development of novel therapies by allowing direct and repeatable visualization of cellular function in the living eye, to study loss of vision in animal models of retinal disease, as well as evaluate the time course of retinal function following therapeutic intervention. We use high-resolution adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy to image fluorescence from the calcium sensor GCaMP6s. In mice with photoreceptor degeneration (rd10), we measured restored visual responses in ganglion cell layer neurons expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin ChrimsonR over a six-week period following significant loss of visual responses. Combining a fluorescent calcium sensor, a channelrhodopsin, and adaptive optics enables all-optical stimulation and recording of retinal neurons in the living eye. Because the retina is an accessible portal to the central nervous system, our method also provides a novel non-invasive method of dissecting neuronal processing in the brain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>All-optical recording and stimulation of retinal neurons &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; in retinal degeneration mice</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</originId><fingerprint>8b125121</fingerprint><author><name>Soon Keen Cheong</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194947</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0e:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Soon Keen Cheong, Jennifer M.

Births outside marriage (BoM) account for around 15% of all births globally. However, the distribution around the world is very uneven, as are cultural and political attitudes towards them. Studies from East Asia have shown that the percentage of such births is very low, with only modest increases in recent years. The orthodox demographic view holds that the maintenance of conservative views around the relationship between marriage and childbearing can play a role in keeping fertility low. Prenuptial pregnancies (PNP) (where births occur within eight months of marriage) have been identified as a growing phenomenon in Japan, possibly being an ‘alternative’ Asian pathway to family formation. As yet, no comprehensive statistical analysis of the trends of BoM or PNP has been performed for Hong Kong. Using a comprehensive microdata set of birth registration in Hong Kong from 1984–2015 (N = 1,680,831) we provide evidence of recent trends in such ‘alternative pathways’ to family formation and examine predictors through regression analysis. Our results indicate, in common with elsewhere in East Asia, low overall period rates of either BoM or PNP (although the latter has risen notably in recent years). While more recent birth cohorts exhibit higher prevalence of such births, their incomplete nature and higher expected propensity suggests that the figures are exaggerated. In our regression analysis, we find that lower educational attainment is a strong predictor of both BoM and PNP, suggesting that a bifurcation of experience may be occurring. This adds further evidence to the theory that the maintenance of traditional family formation systems in the context of revolutionised educational and work opportunities for women mean that the opportunity costs of the ‘marriage package’ become too high. Current disparities in rights and privileges between married and unmarried parents–and especially their children–means that targeted family planning services and support for vulnerable families are policy priorities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The changing relationship between marriage and childbearing in Hong Kong</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</originId><fingerprint>de73defb</fingerprint><author><name>Stuart Gietel-Basten</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194948</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0f:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stuart Gietel-Basten, Georgia Verropoulou&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study is to disclose the potential bioactive components of &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, a native parasitic natural plant of flora palaestina and to open direction towards new prospective application. GC-MS analysis identified 18 components in the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. The most appealing among them are Sesamin and two other phytosterols (Campesterol and Stigmasterol), all of which are documented in the scientific literature for their anticancer activity. Quantitation of Sesamin extracted from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; by HPLC-PDA with the use of three organic solvents showed that the Sesamin content in the methanolic extract was the highest. Following the disclosure of Sesamin presence in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, we raised the question of whether it is produced naturally in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; or acquired from the host plant. The quantitation of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; was performed while being with five different host plants, and was compared with the amount of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; grown alone. The findings reveal that Sesamin is an endogenous secondary metabolite in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, further studies are required to prove if &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; can be used as an alternative source of anticancer phytochemicals, mainly Sesamin, and if proteins in the Sesamin production pathway could be valid biological targets for the development of novel and selective pesticides for control/ eradication of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; and maybe some other &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta&lt;/i&gt; species.

Supplying food for the anticipated global population of over 9 billion in 2050 under changing climate conditions is one of the major challenges of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Agricultural expansion and intensification contributes to global environmental change and risks the long-term sustainability of the planet. It has been proposed that no more than 15% of the global ice-free land surface should be converted to cropland. Bioenergy production for land-based climate mitigation places additional pressure on limited land resources. Here we test normative targets of food supply and bioenergy production within the cropland planetary boundary using a global land-use model. The results suggest supplying the global population with adequate food is possible without cropland expansion exceeding the planetary boundary. Yet this requires an increase in food production, especially in developing countries, as well as a decrease in global crop yield gaps. However, under current assumptions of future food requirements, it was not possible to also produce significant amounts of first generation bioenergy without cropland expansion. These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Food supply and bioenergy production within the global cropland planetary boundary</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194695</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194695</originId><fingerprint>2f96cfa1</fingerprint><author><name>R.

We sought to measure the response of cortisol concentrations around a professional tennis match and its association with hydration status and neuromuscular performance. Nine professional male tennis players were tested in a rest day, and 2-week after, during the first match of a professional tournament played in a clay-court. Salivary concentrations of cortisol (SalCC) were measured in a resting day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm), at the match day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm) and immediately before and after the match. Hydration status was assessed before the match (urine specific gravity; USG) while fluid turnover was tracked during the match. Finally, counter movement jump (CMJ) and handgrip isometric strength (HS) were measured before and after the match. SalCC, either in the morning (P = 0.161) and afternoon (P = 0.683) was similar in rest and match days. However, SalCC increased after the match (P = 0.033). Participants started the match hypohydrated (USG = 1.026±0.002) and during the match lost 1.0±0.3% of body weight despite 1.035±0.124 L/h of fluid ingested. CMJ and HS did not change post-match (P = 0.210 and P = 0.881, respectively). Correlations between the elevations in SalCC and dehydration (% BW loss) during the match were significant (r = -0.632; P = 0.034). Professional male tennis players did not show an anticipatory increase in SalCC the day of the match and neither signs of neuromuscular fatigue after it. During the match, the mild dehydration (i.e., &amp;lt;1.5%) was associated with the increases in cortisol levels which suggests that dehydration may be an added stress to be considered.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Hormonal and neuromuscular responses during a singles match in male professional tennis players</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</originId><fingerprint>4405404f</fingerprint><author><name>Álvaro López-Samanes</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523048400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd072:7c9981b6</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Álvaro López-Samanes, Jesús G.

Hydration status was assessed before the match (urine specific gravity; USG) while fluid turnover was tracked during the match. Finally, counter movement jump (CMJ) and handgrip isometric strength (HS) were measured before and after the match. SalCC, either in the morning (P = 0.161) and afternoon (P = 0.683) was similar in rest and match days. However, SalCC increased after the match (P = 0.033). Participants started the match hypohydrated (USG = 1.026±0.002) and during the match lost 1.0±0.3% of body weight despite 1.035±0.124 L/h of fluid ingested. CMJ and HS did not change post-match (P = 0.210 and P = 0.881, respectively). Correlations between the elevations in SalCC and dehydration (% BW loss) during the match were significant (r = -0.632; P = 0.034). Professional male tennis players did not show an anticipatory increase in SalCC the day of the match and neither signs of neuromuscular fatigue after it. During the match, the mild dehydration (i.e., &amp;lt;1.5%) was associated with the increases in cortisol levels which suggests that dehydration may be an added stress to be considered.</description><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><crawled>1523036346876</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;How is protein synthesis initiated locally in neurons?

Although anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is considered a successful procedure in restoring knee stability, few studies have addressed the issue of aerobic capacity after ACL surgery. Soccer players need technical, tactical and physical skills to succeed, such as good knee function and aerobic capacity. Our purpose is to evaluate aerobic fitness in ACL injured professional football players and six months after ACL reconstruction compared to a control group. Twenty athletes with ACL injury were evaluated and underwent ACL reconstruction with hamstrings autograft, and were compared to twenty healthy professional soccer players. The methods used to evaluate aerobic fitness were maximum oxygen uptake (VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt;) and ventilatory thresholds with a treadmill protocol, before and six months after surgery, compared to a control group. Knee function questionnaires, isokinetic strength testing and body composition evaluation were also performed. Results: Median ACL-injured patients age was 21 years old, and controls 20.5 years old. (n.s.). Preoperative VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt; in the ACL injured group was 45.2 ± 4.3 mL/kg/min, postoperative 48.9 ± 3.8 mL/kg/min and controls 56.9 ± 4.2 mL/kg/min. (p&amp;lt; .001 in all comparisons). Body composition evaluation was similar in all situations. Knee function questionnaires and quadriceps peak torque deficit improved after surgery but were significantly lower compared to controls. Conclusion: Aerobic fitness is significantly reduced in professional soccer players with ACL injury, and six months of rehabilitation was not enough to restore aerobic function after ACL reconstruction, compared to non-injured players of the same level.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Aerobic fitness in professional soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194432</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194432</originId><fingerprint>df2a2d4c</fingerprint><author><name>Adriano Marques de Almeida</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194432</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123928:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adriano Marques de Almeida, Paulo Roberto Santos Silva, André Pedrinelli, Arnaldo J.

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Context matters (but how and why?)

Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled></item><item><title>B-Cell-Specific Diversion of Glucose Carbon Utilization Reveals a Unique Vulnerability in B Cell Malignancies</title><origin><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell</title><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/7051</streamId></origin><description>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell, Volume 173, Issue 2&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Gang Xiao, Lai N.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes. HFD mice showed increments in colonic MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, as well as a decrease in &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in both colonic and epididymal tissues. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in SP and iNOS expression in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice. In preparations from HFD mice, electrically evoked contractions upon NOS blockade or mediated by tachykininergic stimulation were enhanced. In HFD mice, Apigenin counteracted the increase in body and epididymal fat weight, as well as the alterations of metabolic indexes. Apigenin reduced also MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 colonic levels as well as eosinophil infiltration, SP and iNOS expression, along with a normalization of electrically evoked tachykininergic and nitrergic contractions. In addition, apigenin normalized &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in epididymal fat tissues, but not in colonic specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions and implications &lt;p&gt;Apigenin prevents systemic metabolic alterations, counteracts enteric inflammation and normalizes colonic dysmotility associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The flavonoid compound apigenin prevents colonic inflammation and motor dysfunctions associated with high fat diet-induced obesity</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195502</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195502</originId><fingerprint>bd7e623b</fingerprint><author><name>Daniela Gentile</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195502</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523480400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd90:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Gentile, Matteo Fornai, Rocchina Colucci, Carolina Pellegrini, Erika Tirotta, Laura Benvenuti, Cristina Segnani, Chiara Ippolito, Emiliano Duranti, Agostino Virdis, Sara Carpi, Paola Nieri, Zoltán H.

DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300681v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>bf49039f</fingerprint><author><name>Eraslan, G.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300681v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523602800000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162c1bf41a7:1a4cc02:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300681v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/13/300681</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523668959655</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuning Ising superconductivity with layer and spin–orbit coupling in two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuning Ising superconductivity with layer and spin–orbit coupling in two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03888-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03888-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is promising to host features of topological superconductivity.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; exhibits intrinsic resistance to diverse groups of antibiotics in particular while growing in biofilms. Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, no comparative study to investigate the biofilm architectures of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and the related &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; under different nutrient concentrations has been reported. Therefore, this study aims to provide new information on the effects of four antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;. ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMI), meropenem (MEM) and doxycycline (DOX) on biofilm architecture of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; with different nutrient concentrations under static and flow conditions using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Impact of nutritional stress on drug susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; grown planktonically or as biofilm was also evaluated. The findings of this study indicate that nutrient-limited environment enhanced survival of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm after exposure to the tested antibiotics. The shedding planktonic &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; were also found to have increased CAZ tolerance in nutrient-limited environment. However, killing activities of MEM and IMI were stronger than CAZ and DOX on &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; both in planktonic cells and in 2-day old biofilm.

Differences in biofilm architecture were observed for biofilms grown under static and flow conditions. Under static conditions, biofilms grown in full strength modified Vogel and Bonner’s medium (MVBM) showed honeycomb-like architecture while a knitted-like structure was observed under limited nutrient condition (0.1×MVBM). Under flow conditions, biofilms grown in MVBM showed a multilayer structure while merely dispersed bacteria were found when grown in 0.1×MVBM. Altogether, this study provides more insight on the effect of four antibiotics against &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm under different nutrient and flow conditions.

Insulin is a vital part of diabetes treatment, whereas glucagon is primarily used to treat insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, glucagon is suggested to have a central role in the regulation of body weight, which would be beneficial for diabetic patients. Since the glucagon effect on blood glucose is known to be transient, it is relevant to investigate the pharmacodynamics of glucagon after repeated dosing. In the present study, we used telemetry to continuously measure blood glucose in streptozotocin induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. This allowed for a more detailed analysis of glucose regulation compared to intermittent blood sampling. In particular, we evaluated the blood glucose-lowering effect of different insulin doses alone, and in combination with a long acting glucagon analog (LAG). We showed how the effect of the LAG accumulated and persisted over time. Furthermore, we found that addition of the LAG decreased body weight without affecting food intake.
In a subsequent study, we focused on the glucagon effect on body weight and food intake during equal glycemic control. In order to obtain comparable maximum blood glucose lowering effect to insulin alone, the insulin dose had to be increased four times in combination with 1 nmol/kg of the LAG. In this set-up the LAG prevented further increase in body weight despite the four times higher insulin-dose. However, the body composition was changed. The insulin group increased both lean and fat mass, whereas the group receiving four times insulin in combination with the LAG only significantly increased the fat mass. No differences were observed in food intake, suggesting a direct effect on energy expenditure by glucagon. Surprisingly, we observed decreased levels of FGF21 in plasma compared to insulin treatment alone. With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Sustained effect of glucagon on body weight and blood glucose: Assessed by continuous glucose monitoring in diabetic rats</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</originId><fingerprint>7444c4b7</fingerprint><author><name>Christina Pedersen</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521579600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37a9:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christina Pedersen, Trine Porsgaard, Maria Thomsen, Mette Marie Rosenkilde, Nikolaj Kulahin Roed&lt;/p&gt;

In this set-up the LAG prevented further increase in body weight despite the four times higher insulin-dose. However, the body composition was changed. The insulin group increased both lean and fat mass, whereas the group receiving four times insulin in combination with the LAG only significantly increased the fat mass. No differences were observed in food intake, suggesting a direct effect on energy expenditure by glucagon. Surprisingly, we observed decreased levels of FGF21 in plasma compared to insulin treatment alone. With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194468</canonicalUrl><crawled>1521567726732</crawled></item><item><content><content>Despite its popularity, characterization of subpopulations with transcript abundance is subject to a significant amount of noise.

Niosomes are used in studies for drug delivery or gene transfer. However, their physical properties and features relative to liposomes are not well documented. To characterize and more rationally optimize niosome formulations, the properties of these vesicle systems are compared to those of liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids plus cholesterol. Niosomes are highly stable and only slightly more leaky than liposomes as assayed by calcein leakage; the permeability for ions (KCl) is higher than that of liposomes. Contrary to liposomes, the size of niosomes decreases substantially upon freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent thawing, as shown by cryo-EM and dynamic light scattering. The packing of niosomal membranes was determined by laurdan fluorescence and is slightly lower than that of liposomes. We did not succeed in the functional reconstitution of the L-arginine/L-ornithine antiporter ArcD2 in niosomes, which we attribute to the non-ionic nature of the surfactants. The antimicrobial peptides alamethicin and melittin act similarly on niosomes and liposomes composed of unsaturated components, whereas both niosomes and liposomes are unaffected when saturated amphiphiles are used. In conclusion, in terms of stability and permeability for drug-size molecules niosomes are comparable to liposomes and they may offer an excellent, inexpensive alternative for delivery purposes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Niosomes, an alternative for liposomal delivery</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194179</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194179</originId><fingerprint>3667a9ec</fingerprint><author><name>Rianne Bartelds</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194179</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7125:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rianne Bartelds, Mohammad Hadi Nematollahi, Tjeerd Pols, Marc C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Estimating mortality risk during TB treatment in HIV co-infected patients is challenging for health professionals, especially in a low TB prevalence population, due to the lack of a standardized prognostic system. The current study aimed to develop and validate a simple mortality prognostic scoring system for TB/HIV co-infected patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the CDC’s Tuberculosis Genotyping Information Management System of TB patients in Texas reported from 01/2010 through 12/2016, age ≥15 years, HIV(+), and outcome being “completed” or “died”, we developed and internally validated a mortality prognostic score using multiple logistic regression. Model discrimination was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The model’s good calibration was determined by a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow’s goodness of fit test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 450 patients included in the analysis, 57 (12.7%) died during TB treatment. The final prognostic score used six characteristics (age, residence in long-term care facility, meningeal TB, chest x-ray, culture positive, and culture not converted/unknown), which are routinely collected by TB programs. Prognostic scores were categorized into three groups that predicted mortality: low-risk (&amp;lt;20 points), medium-risk (20–25 points) and high-risk (&gt;25 points). The model had good discrimination and calibration (AUC = 0.82; 0.80 in bootstrap validation), and a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow test p = 0.71.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our simple validated mortality prognostic scoring system can be a practical tool for health professionals in identifying TB/HIV co-infected patients with high mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Prognostic score to predict mortality during TB treatment in TB/HIV co-infected patients</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196022</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196022</originId><fingerprint>17467d7c</fingerprint><author><name>Duc T.

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ≥15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults. However, older adults have a higher all-cause mortality rate, perhaps partially driven by late presentation to care.

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ≥15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001).

Background/Objectives &lt;p&gt;Abdominal obesity (AO) is associated with elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases; however, this association is less clear for non-obese people. We estimated the association of AO and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and disease in non-obese adult individuals from Chile.&lt;/p&gt; Subjects/Methods &lt;p&gt;5248 adults (15 years of age or older) of both sexes from the Chilean National Health Survey (October 2009 –September 2010, response rate 85%.) were included. Information on myocardial infarction and stroke was self-reported. BMI, waist circumference (WC), arterial pressure, plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels were measured. Predictive accuracy of WC was evaluated by area under curve of receiver operating characteristic analysis and cut off points were established by Youden Index. Relationship between AO and CVRF was analyzed by Chi-squared tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Normal weight/overweight/obesity were present in 34.4%/45.2%/18.1% of men and 33.4%/33.6%/27.5% of women. Predictive accuracy of WC to identify at least one CVRF was 0.70/0.67 and optimal cutoff points for WC in non-obese subjects were 91/83 cm in men/women, respectively. AO was present in 98.2%/99.1% of obese, 70.5%/77.4% of overweight and 12.4%/16.4% of normal weight men/women. AO was associated with increased frequency of CVRF in overweight men (6/8 and stroke) and women (4/8) and higher frequency in normal weight men (8/8 and myocardial infarction/stroke) and women (6/8 and myocardial infarction).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;WC cutoff points calculated for non-obese chilean population discriminate more differences in CVRF in normal weight woman. AO significantly increases the frequency of CVRF and diseases in overweight and especially normal weight individuals. WC can be used as a low cost, feasible and reproducible predictor for CVRF in non-obese individuals in most clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Abdominal obesity is a common finding in normal and overweight subjects of Chile and is associated with increased frequency of cardiometabolic risk factors</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194644</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194644</originId><fingerprint>744df93c</fingerprint><author><name>Beatriz Villanueva</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194644</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5eb:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beatriz Villanueva, Antonio Arteaga, Alberto Maiz, Víctor A.

&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most important plant pathogens in the world, causing root rot in more than a thousand plant species. This observational study was carried out on a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; infected heathland of &lt;i&gt;Erica umbellata&lt;/i&gt; used as goat pasture. The patterns and shapes of disease foci and their distribution were described in a spatial and temporal context using an aerial photograph record. A set of topographic traits was selected on the basis of a disease dynamic hypothesis and their effects on observed spatial disease patterns were analyzed. Incipient infections situated in flat terrain expanded as compact circular front patterns with a low growth rate. On slopes, disease patches developed more rapidly down slope, forming parabolic shapes. The axis direction of the parabolas was highly correlated with terrain aspect, while the parabolic amplitude was associated with land curvature and slope. New secondary foci appeared over the years producing an accelerated increase of the affected surface. These new foci were observed in sites where disease density was higher or near sites more frequently visited by animals such as the stable or the forage crop. In contrast, a smaller number of disease foci occur in areas which animals are reluctant to visit, such as where they have a short range of vision. Our results suggest that 1) the growth of existing &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; foci is controlled by a combination of root-to-root contact and water flows, 2) the increase in the diseased area arises mainly from the multiplication of patches, 3) the formation of new foci is mediated by long-distance transport due to the movement of animals and humans along certain preferential pathways, and 4) geomorphology and topography traits are associated with the epidemiology of this soil-borne pathogen.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Topographic effects on dispersal patterns of &amp;lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&amp;lt;/i&gt; at a stand scale in a Spanish heathland</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</originId><fingerprint>7f82b0f</fingerprint><author><name>Enrique Cardillo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522443600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c50:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enrique Cardillo, Angel Acedo, Enrique Abad&lt;/p&gt;

Several processes such as homoeolog loss and deep coalescence can potentially hamper our ability to recover the historical signal correctly.

Understanding how neurons cooperate to integrate sensory inputs and guide behavior is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction (HD) system, we present evidence demonstrating how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised Machine Learning tool, can learn the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. We show how the method, unlike linear analysis, reveals that the coordination in thalamo-cortical circuits is qualitatively the same during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine Learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eLys5LrtLXM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Brain-state invariant thalamo-cortical coordination revealed by non-linear encoders</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006041</link><recrawled>1521750245762</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006041</originId><fingerprint>9b8ac515</fingerprint><author><name>Guillaume Viejo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/eLys5LrtLXM/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1624ed0b0a5:56ecb:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Viejo, Thomas Cortier, Adrien Peyrache&lt;/p&gt;

Deformed wing virus (DWV) is an important pathogen in a broad range of insects, including honey bees. Concordant with the spread of &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt;, DWV is present in the majority of honey bee colonies and can result in either low-level infections with asymptomatic bees that nonetheless exhibit increased colony loss under stress, or high-level infections with acute effects on bee health and viability. DWV can be transmitted vertically or horizontally and evidence suggests that horizontal transmission via &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt; is associated with acute symptomatic infections. Vertical transmission also occurs and is presumably important for the maintenance of DWV in honey bee populations. To further our understanding the vertical transmission of DWV through queens, we performed three experiments: we studied the quantitative effectiveness of vertical transmission, surveyed the prevalence of successful egg infection under commercial conditions, and distinguished among three possible mechanisms of transmission. We find that queen-infection level predicts the DWV titers in their eggs, although the transmission is not very efficient. Our quantitative assessment of DWV demonstrates that eggs in 1/3 of the colonies are infected with DWV and highly infected eggs are rare in newly-installed spring colonies. Additionally, our results indicate that DWV transmission occurs predominantly by virus adhering to the surface of eggs (transovum) rather than intracellularly. Our combined results suggest that the queens’ DWV vectoring capacity in practice is not as high as its theoretical potential. Thus, DWV transmission by honey bee queens is part of the DWV epidemic with relevant practical implications, which should be further studied.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Quantitative patterns of vertical transmission of deformed wing virus in honey bees</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195283</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195283</originId><fingerprint>94a2f6db</fingerprint><author><name>Esmaeil Amiri</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195283</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde34:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Esmaeil Amiri, Per Kryger, Marina D.

For tetramer, a highly symmetrical S4 structure was found as the most stable form in good accordance with experimentally determined tetramer unit in the formaldehyde crystal. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522649592000</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162956fcc6f:a3d99f3:9f3b30f2</id><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</link><crawled>1522925554799</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This big&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This big, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03309-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03309-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A ray of hope.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>This big</title><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This big&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This big, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03309-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03309-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A ray of hope.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03309-y</originId><fingerprint>ada1f1a3</fingerprint><author><name>John Cooper Hamilton</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03309-y</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521615600000</published><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16248ae974f:3647098:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>9</engagement><unread>False</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03309-y</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1521637824335</crawled></item><item><content><content>Signal transduction pathways are largely based on the compilation of individual post-translational modification assays in heterogeneous cellular contexts.

Background &lt;p&gt;Frequent changes in the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) occurring worldwide demand regular surveillance to study their composition and distribution in healthcare facilities. We investigated the genotypic characteristics of MRSA obtained in Kuwait hospitals to better understand their clonal distribution.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,327 MRSA isolates obtained from clinical samples in 13 Kuwait hospitals from 1 January to 31 December 2016 were investigated using antibiogram, SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; typing, spa typing and DNA microarray.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The isolates belonged to six SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; types with the majority belonging to type IV (658; 49.5%) and type V (355; 26.7%). Two hundred and sixty-one spa types were identified with spa types t688, t304, t860, t127, t044, t311, t002, t223, t267, t019, t3841, t005, t084, t852, and t657 constituting 51.0% (n = 677) of the isolates. Among the 1,327 MRSA isolates, 102 (7.68%) isolates were identified as novel variants of internationally recognized MRSA clones. These 102 isolates were investigated further and belonged to 14 clonal complexes (CCs) with CC361 (32; 32.3%), CC30 (15; 14.7%), CC22 (13; 12.7%) and CC1 (11, 10.7%) as the dominant CCs. Eighty-one (79.4%) of the novel isolates harbored SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; IV or V+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt; composite genetic elements. Four isolates (3.9%) harbored unusual combinations of &lt;i&gt;ccr&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; complexes comprising of CC6-MRSA [IV+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrC&lt;/i&gt;], CC97-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB2&lt;/i&gt;], CC121-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrB4&lt;/i&gt;] and CC1-MRSA-pseudoSCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; [class B mec+&lt;i&gt;fusc&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB1&lt;/i&gt;]. Forty-six (45.1%) of these isolates were positive for PVL and 89 (87.2%) were resistant to fusidic acid mediated by &lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The study showed the emergence of novel variants of previously recognized MRSA genotypes with unusual genetic characteristics including high prevalence of PVL and fusidic acid resistance in Kuwait hospitals.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely performed to identify brain lesions in boys with central precocious puberty (CPP). We investigated the prevalence of CPP in Korean boys and the necessity for routine brain MRI examinations. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2003 to December 2016 at a Korean university hospital. Among 151 boys who were diagnosed with CPP, the data of 138 boys who underwent sellar MRI were evaluated. The mean age of the study subjects was 9.51 ± 0.56 years (&amp;lt;8 years [n = 4] and ≥8 years [n = 134]). We excluded patients who had been previously diagnosed with brain tumors and those who did not undergo a sellar MRI because of refusal or the decision of the pediatric endocrinologist. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of intracranial lesions among boys with CPP. Normal sellar MRI findings were observed in 128 of the 138 boys (93%). Mild brain abnormalities were found in 10 boys (7%), while none of the patients had pathological brain lesions. The prevalence (7%) of intracranial lesions among boys who were healthy, did not have neurological symptoms, and were diagnosed with CPP was different from that previously reported. None of the identified lesions necessitated treatment. Although this was a single country study, we found that the previously reported prevalence of brain lesions in boys with CPP is much higher than the prevalence observed in Korea. This study suggests the need to globally reevaluate the prevalence of pathological brain lesions among male pediatric patients with CPP.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The prevalence of brain abnormalities in boys with central precocious puberty may be overestimated</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195209</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195209</originId><fingerprint>8f45462f</fingerprint><author><name>Jong Seo Yoon</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195209</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522789200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5b:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jong Seo Yoon, Cheol Hwan So, Hae Sang Lee, Jung Sub Lim, Jin Soon Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

Our model is quantitative in nature and should be useful for PPI site identification, protein-protein docking and structure-based design of chemicals targeting PPI.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294074v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>cce9d6e</fingerprint><author><name>Wang, L.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294074v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522738800000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1628d4f91c3:97dab10:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294074v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/03/294074</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522789224899</crawled></item><item><content><content>Summary: The excessive amount of zeros in single-cell RNA-seq data include &apos;real&apos; zeros due to the on-off nature of gene transcription in single cells and &apos;dropout&apos; zeros due to technical reasons.

Nitric oxide (NO) regulates neuronal function and thus is critical for tuning neuronal communication. Mechanisms by which NO modulates protein function and interaction include posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as S-nitrosylation. Importantly, cross signaling between S-nitrosylation and prenylation can have major regulatory potential. However, the exact protein targets and resulting changes in function remain elusive. Here, we interrogated the role of NO-dependent PTMs and farnesylation in synaptic transmission. We found that NO compromises synaptic function at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in a cGMP-independent manner. NO suppressed release and reduced the size of available vesicle pools, which was reversed by glutathione (GSH) and occluded by genetic up-regulation of GSH-generating and de-nitrosylating glutamate-cysteine-ligase and S-nitroso-glutathione reductase activities. Enhanced nitrergic activity led to S-nitrosylation of the fusion-clamp protein complexin (cpx) and altered its membrane association and interactions with active zone (AZ) and soluble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein Attachment Protein Receptor (SNARE) proteins. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacological suppression of farnesylation and a nitrosylation mimetic mutant of cpx induced identical physiological and localization phenotypes as caused by NO. Together, our data provide evidence for a novel physiological nitrergic molecular switch involving S-nitrosylation, which reversibly suppresses farnesylation and thereby enhances the net-clamping function of cpx. These data illustrate a new mechanistic signaling pathway by which regulation of farnesylation can fine-tune synaptic release.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6OU2NItN4wI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Nitric oxide-mediated posttranslational modifications control neurotransmitter release by modulating complexin farnesylation and enhancing its clamping ability</title><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003611</link><recrawled>1523300400433</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003611</originId><fingerprint>807ba190</fingerprint><author><name>Susan W.

We report on a universal sample-independent sensorless adaptive optics method, based on modal optimization of the second moment of the fluorescence emission from a point-like excitation. Our method employs a sample-independent precalibration, performed only once for the particular system, to establish the direct relation between the image quality and the aberration. The method is potentially applicable to any form of microscopy with epifluorescence detection, including the practically important case of incoherent fluorescence emission from a three dimensional object, through minor hardware modifications.

Background &lt;p&gt;Concerns regarding vaccine safety are increasing along with lack of compliance to vaccination schedules. This study aimed to assess vaccination-related risks and the impact of a Special Immunization Service (SIS) at the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of Padua on vaccination compliance among participants.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study included all children attending the SIS from January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2002 to December 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2015. The Service is divided into a clinic (SIS-C) where all referred children undergo a pre-vaccination visit and an area within the Pediatric Emergency Department (SIS-PED) where children are vaccinated if indicated. During each SIS-C visit, age, gender, admission criteria and scheduled vaccinations were recorded, with any vaccine-related adverse events captured during SIS-PED visits. Follow-up was conducted to evaluate vaccination plan completion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;359 children received 560 vaccine administrations (41.3% MMR/MMRV, 17.5% hexavalent) at the SIS during the 14 year study. Admission criteria were adverse events after previous vaccination (immediate, IgE/not IgE mediated, and late) in 27.2% of cases, non-anaphylactic allergies (mostly egg allergy) in 42.7% and anaphylaxis in 10.3%. After vaccination, 15/560 (2.7%) mild adverse events were observed. 96.3% of children vaccinated at least once at the SIS-PED and available for follow-up completed their vaccination plan, in contrast to 55.5% of children referred to the SIS-C who were not vaccinated in SIS-PED.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For children referred to SIS-C and available for follow-up, vaccination in SIS-PED was associated with more frequent completion of vaccination plans, indicating a benefit of the service to vaccine coverage.

Mosquitoes that have been genetically engineered for resistance to human pathogens are a potential new tool for controlling vector-borne disease. However, genetic modification may have unintended off-target effects that could affect the mosquitoes’ utility for disease control. We measured the resistance of five genetically modified &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt;-suppressing &lt;i&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/i&gt; lines to o’nyong’nyong virus, four classes of insecticides, and diverse &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; field isolates and characterized the interactions between our genetic modifications and infection with the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;. The genetic modifications did not alter the mosquitoes’ resistance to either o’nyong’nyong virus or insecticides, and the mosquitoes were equally resistant to all tested &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; strains, regardless of &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; infection status.

Barriers to drug resistance vary with target biochemistry and detailed analysis of these barriers should lead to the use of fewer drugs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522195200000</published><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1626c77a0da:6a48f0a:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32579</link><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32579</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522238202074</crawled></item><item><title>From Nogo to go</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-s?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>9ace10a</fingerprint><author><name>Wong, W.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-s?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522950073000</published><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a52983d:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-s?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/44.19.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951977478</crawled></item><item><title>The Discrete Existence of Singlet Nitrenium Ions Revisited: Computational Studies of Non-Aryl Nitrenium Ions and Their Rearrangements</title><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><description>Nitrenium ion species are examined using computational methods (DFT, MP2, coupled-cluster, and a composite method, CBS-APNO) with a particular emphasis on non-aromatic species (i.e. those lacking an aromatic or heteroaromatic ring in direct conjugation with the formal nitrenium ion center.)

Antimicrobial peptides represent an alternative to traditional antibiotics that may be less susceptible to bacterial resistance mechanisms by directly attacking the bacterial cell membrane. However, bacteria have a variety of defense mechanisms that can prevent cationic antimicrobial peptides from reaching the cell membrane. The L- and D-enantiomers of the antimicrobial peptide GL13K were tested against the Gram-positive bacteria &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus gordonii&lt;/i&gt; to understand the role of bacterial proteases and cell wall modifications in bacterial resistance. GL13K was derived from the human salivary protein BPIFA2. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by broth dilution and a serial assay used to determine bacterial resistance. Peptide degradation was determined in a bioassay utilizing a luminescent strain of &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; to detect peptide activity. Autolysis and D-alanylation-deficient strains of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gordonii&lt;/i&gt; were tested in autolysis assays and peptide activity assays. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; protease inactivated L-GL13K but not D-GL13K, whereas autolysis did not affect peptide activity. Indeed, the D-enantiomer appeared to kill the bacteria prior to initiation of autolysis. D-alanylation mutants were killed by L-GL13K whereas this modification did not affect killing by D-GL13K. The mutants regained resistance to L-GL13K whereas bacteria did not gain resistance to D-GL13K after repeated treatment with the peptides. D-alanylation affected the hydrophobicity of bacterial cells but hydrophobicity alone did not affect GL13K activity. D-GL13K evades two resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive bacteria without giving rise to substantial new resistance.

Background &lt;p&gt;Accurate estimates of the impact of alcohol on overall and age-specific mortality are crucial for formulating health policies. However, different approaches to estimating alcohol-attributable mortality provide different results, and a detailed comparison of age-specific estimates is missing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data on cause of death, alcohol consumption, and relative risks of mortality at different consumption levels, we compare eight estimates of sex- and age-specific alcohol-attributable mortality in France (2010) and Finland (2013): five estimates using cause-of-death approaches (with one accounting for contributory causes), and three estimates using attributable fraction (AF) approaches.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;AF-related approaches and the approach based on alcohol-related underlying and contributory causes of death provided estimates of alcohol-attributable mortality that were twice as high as the estimates found using underlying cause-of-death approaches in both countries and sexes. The differences across the methods were greatest among older age groups An inverse U-shape in age-specific alcohol-attributable mortality (peaking at around age 65) was observed for cause-of-death approaches, with this shape being more pronounced in Finland. AF-related approaches resulted in different estimates at older ages: i.e., mortality was found to increase with age in France; whereas in Finland mortality estimates depended on the underlying assumptions regarding the effects of alcohol consumption on cardiovascular mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While the most detailed approaches (i.e., the AF-related approach and the approach that includes underlying and contributory causes) are theoretically able to provide more accurate estimates of alcohol-attributable mortality, they–especially the AF approaches- depend heavily on data availability and quality.

&lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; represents one of the major diarrhea-inducing pathogens threatening public health, but its prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profile in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, China, remains unclear. We conducted comprehensive investigation of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance pattern in Xinjiang, identifying 458 &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates between 2008 to 2014. &lt;i&gt;Shigella flexneri&lt;/i&gt; was identified as predominant species, and several &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were isolated, including atypical serotypes 1c, 2c, and 4s. Dominant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were 2a, 1b, 2b, and Xv, different from those generally dominant in China. A hybrid serotype pattern was observed, which included the major Chinese serotypes (2a, Xv) and those predominant in Pakistan (1b, 2b). &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; was shown to have a lower frequency compared with that generally observed in China, but an increasing trend of infections associated with this pathogen was observed. Furthermore, a high frequency of drug resistance and different &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; antimicrobial resistance patterns were demonstrated as well, including very severe resistance phenotypes, such as multidrug resistance and resistance to frontline antibiotics. Seventy-five cephalosporin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates were frequently identified with the resistance determinants that can undergo horizontal transfer, such as &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TEM&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt;, and integrons, facilitating the development of cephalosporin resistance among &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; subtypes. Additionally, genetic analyses demonstrated that all 86 quinolone-resistant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates possess 3–4 mutation sites in quinolone resistance-determining regions, primarily contributing to their resistance to quinolone. However, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sonnei&lt;/i&gt; isolates were not shown to be quinolone resistant. Co-resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was detected in 17 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates, and these isolates were additionally multidrug resistant and carried β-lactamase genes and quinolone-resistance determinants. As is demonstrated in this study, dominant serotypes of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; were distributed in unique trend with dangerous drug resistance patterns. Novel strategies are urgently required to prevent the development of drug resistance among diarrhea-inducing pathogens.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Dominant serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance profile of &amp;lt;i&gt;Shigella&amp;lt;/i&gt; spp. in Xinjiang, China</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195259</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195259</originId><fingerprint>59d1259b</fingerprint><author><name>Hongbo Liu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195259</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522789200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5e:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongbo Liu, Binghua Zhu, Shaofu Qiu, Yidan Xia, Beibei Liang, Chaojie Yang, Nian Dong, Yongrui Li, Ying Xiang, Shan Wang, Jing Xie, Muti Mahe, Yansong Sun, Hongbin Song&lt;/p&gt;

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings. However, tactile suppression was comparable between conditions arguing against the hypothesis that it frees capacities for processing other relevant visual signals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The role of visual processing on tactile suppression</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</originId><fingerprint>ba854dbd</fingerprint><author><name>Hanna Gertz</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522875600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57601:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;

Rho-GTPases are master regulators of polarity establishment and cell morphology. Positive feedback enables concentration of Rho-GTPases into clusters at the cell cortex, from where they regulate the cytoskeleton. Different cell types reproducibly generate either one (e.g. the front of a migrating cell) or several clusters (e.g. the multiple dendrites of a neuron), but the mechanistic basis for unipolar or multipolar outcomes is unclear. The design principles of Rho-GTPase circuits are captured by two-component reaction-diffusion models based on conserved aspects of Rho-GTPase biochemistry. Some such models display rapid winner-takes-all competition between clusters, yielding a unipolar outcome. Other models allow prolonged co-existence of clusters. We investigate the behavior of a simple class of models and show that while the timescale of competition varies enormously depending on model parameters, a single factor explains a large majority of this variation. The dominant factor concerns the degree to which the maximal active GTPase concentration in a cluster approaches a “saturation point” determined by model parameters. We suggest that both saturation and the effect of saturation on competition reflect fundamental properties of the Rho-GTPase polarity machinery, regardless of the specific feedback mechanism, which predict whether the system will generate unipolar or multipolar outcomes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtPVWxk38yc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Principles that govern competition or co-existence in Rho-GTPase driven polarization</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006095</link><recrawled>1523565724244</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006095</originId><fingerprint>32706f56</fingerprint><author><name>Jian-Geng Chiou</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/HtPVWxk38yc/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162baf3e3ad:bf9d21:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian-Geng Chiou, Samuel A.

We suggest that both saturation and the effect of saturation on competition reflect fundamental properties of the Rho-GTPase polarity machinery, regardless of the specific feedback mechanism, which predict whether the system will generate unipolar or multipolar outcomes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtPVWxk38yc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><engagement>7</engagement><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006095</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><crawled>1523554968493</crawled></item><item><title>[ASAP] Molecular Mechanism of Uptake of Cationic Photoantimicrobial Phthalocyanine across Bacterial Membranes Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11707/20180403/images/medium/jp-2017-11707g_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11707&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Immune-compromised mouse models allow for testing the preclinical efficacy of human cell transplantations and gene therapy strategies before moving forward to clinical trials. However, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of the &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sh&lt;/sup&gt; mouse strain to create an immune-compromised model lacking function of &lt;i&gt;Rag2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Il2rγ&lt;/i&gt; led to unexpected morbidity and mortality. This warranted an investigation to ascertain the cause and predisposing factors associated with the outbreak. Postmortem examination was performed on 15 moribund mice. The main lesions observed in these mice consisted of ascending urogenital tract infections, suppurative otitis media, pneumonia, myocarditis, and meningoencephalomyelitis. As &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains harboring polyketide synthase (&lt;i&gt;pks)&lt;/i&gt; genomic island were recently isolated from laboratory mice, the tissue sections from the urogenital tract, heart, and middle ear were subjected to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; specific PNA-FISH assay that revealed discrete colonies of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; associated with the lesions. Microbiological examination and 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. coli-induced infection and septicemia in the affected mice. Further characterization by &lt;i&gt;clb&lt;/i&gt; gene analysis and colibactin toxicity assays of the &lt;i&gt;pks+ E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; revealed colibactin-associated cytotoxicity.

Both stem cell therapy and physical treatments have been shown to be beneficial in accelerating bone healing. However, the efficacy of combined treatment with stem cells and physical stimuli for large bone defects remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone regeneration effects of low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) and human adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) treatments during fracture repair using a comparative rat calvarial defect model. We evaluated the viability of human ADSCs, which were cultured on a porous PLGA scaffold using an MTS assay. The critical-sized calvarial bone defect rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPLI group, ADSC group, and ADSC+LPLI group. Bone formation was evaluated using micro-CT. New bone formation areas and osteogenic factor expression levels were then examined by histomorphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Our data showed that PLGA had no cytotoxic effect on human ADSCs. Micro-CT analyses revealed that both the LPLI and ADSC groups showed improved calvarial bone defect healing compared to the control group. In addition, the ADSC+LPLI group showed significantly increased bone volume at 16 weeks after surgery. The area of new bone formation ranked as follows: control group &amp;lt; LPLI group &amp;lt; ADSC group &amp;lt; ADSC+LPLI group. There were significant differences between the groups. In addition, both ADSC and ADSC+LPLI groups showed strong signals of vWF expression. ADSC and LPLI treatments improved fracture repair in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats. Importantly, the combined treatment of ADSCs and LPLI further enhances the bone healing process.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Low power laser irradiation and human adipose-derived stem cell treatments promote bone regeneration in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195337</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195337</originId><fingerprint>3df21530</fingerprint><author><name>Yan-Hsiung Wang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195337</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4613:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yan-Hsiung Wang, Jyun-Yi Wu, Su Chii Kong, Min-Hsuan Chiang, Mei-Ling Ho, Ming-Long Yeh, Chia-Hsin Chen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging yeast pathogen of global significance. Its multidrug-resistant nature and inadequacies of conventional identification systems pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This study investigated occurrence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in clinical specimens in Kuwait and its susceptibility to antifungal agents. Clinical yeast strains isolated during 3.5-year period and forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida were studied by wet mount examination for microscopic morphology and Vitek 2 yeast identification system. A simple species-specific PCR assay was developed for molecular identification and results were confirmed by PCR-sequencing of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing of one isolate from each patient was determined by Etest. The 280 isolates forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida, were identified by Vitek 2 as &lt;i&gt;Candida haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 166), &lt;i&gt;Candida utilis&lt;/i&gt; (n = 49), &lt;i&gt;Candida kefyr&lt;/i&gt; (n = 45), &lt;i&gt;Candida guilliermondii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 9), &lt;i&gt;Candida famata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida conglobata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 5). Species-specific PCR and PCR-sequencing of rDNA identified 166 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; isolates as &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; (n = 158), &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida duobushaemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 2). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates originated from diverse clinical specimens from 56 patients. Of 56 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested, all were resistant to fluconazole, 41/56 (73%) and 13/56 (23%) were additionally resistant to voriconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Eleven (20%) isolates were resistant to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. One isolate was resistant to caspofungin and micafungin.

&lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging yeast pathogen of global significance. Its multidrug-resistant nature and inadequacies of conventional identification systems pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This study investigated occurrence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in clinical specimens in Kuwait and its susceptibility to antifungal agents. Clinical yeast strains isolated during 3.5-year period and forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida were studied by wet mount examination for microscopic morphology and Vitek 2 yeast identification system. A simple species-specific PCR assay was developed for molecular identification and results were confirmed by PCR-sequencing of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing of one isolate from each patient was determined by Etest. The 280 isolates forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida, were identified by Vitek 2 as &lt;i&gt;Candida haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 166), &lt;i&gt;Candida utilis&lt;/i&gt; (n = 49), &lt;i&gt;Candida kefyr&lt;/i&gt; (n = 45), &lt;i&gt;Candida guilliermondii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 9), &lt;i&gt;Candida famata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida conglobata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 5). Species-specific PCR and PCR-sequencing of rDNA identified 166 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; isolates as &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; (n = 158), &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida duobushaemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 2). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates originated from diverse clinical specimens from 56 patients. Of 56 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested, all were resistant to fluconazole, 41/56 (73%) and 13/56 (23%) were additionally resistant to voriconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Eleven (20%) isolates were resistant to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. One isolate was resistant to caspofungin and micafungin. Increasing isolation of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in recent years from diverse clinical specimens including bloodstream shows that &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging non-&lt;i&gt;albicans Candida&lt;/i&gt; species in Kuwait causing a variety of infections.

Outbreaks of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been reported in poultry species in the United States since 2014. These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2–4 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Efficacy and synergy of live-attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccines in young chickens</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195285</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195285</originId><fingerprint>260bbdf1</fingerprint><author><name>Hyesun Jang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195285</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523048400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd074:7c9981b6</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyesun Jang, Mohamed Elaish, Mahesh KC, Michael C.

The bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia was formally described two decades ago and originally believed to be a minor member of many ecosystems; however, it is now recognized as ubiquitous and abundant in both soil and aquatic systems. Nevertheless, knowledge of the drivers of its relative abundance and within-phylum habitat preferences remains sparse, especially in lake systems. Here, we documented the distribution of Verrucomicrobia in 12 inland lakes in Southeastern Michigan, a Laurentian Great Lake (Lake Michigan), and a freshwater estuary, which span a gradient in lake sizes, depths, residence times, and trophic states. A wide range of physical and geochemical parameters was covered by sampling seasonally from the surface and bottom of each lake, and by separating samples into particle-associated and free-living fractions. On average, Verrucomicrobia was the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most abundant phylum (range 1.7–41.7%). Fraction, season, station, and depth explained up to 70% of the variance in Verrucomicrobia community composition and preference for these habitats was phylogenetically conserved at the class-level. When relative abundance was linearly modeled against environmental data, Verrucomicrobia and non-Verrucomicrobia bacterial community composition correlated to similar quantitative environmental parameters, although there were lake system-dependent differences and &gt; 55% of the variance remained unexplained. A majority of the phylum exhibited preference for the particle-associated fraction and two classes (Opitutae and Verrucomicrobiae) were identified to be more abundant during the spring season. This study highlights the high relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in north temperate lake systems and expands insights into drivers of within-phylum habitat preferences of the Verrucomicrobia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Verrucomicrobia are prevalent in north-temperate freshwater lakes and display class-level preferences between lake habitats</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195112</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195112</originId><fingerprint>a8448726</fingerprint><author><name>Edna Chiang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195112</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca425a:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edna Chiang, Marian L.

&lt;i&gt;Lolium perenne&lt;/i&gt; L. (perennial ryegrass) is the most important pasture grass species in temperate regions of the world. However, its growth is restricted in summer dry environments. Germplasm screening can be used to identify accessions or individual plants for incorporation into breeding programs for drought tolerance. We selected nine perennial ryegrass accessions from different global origins and from a range of climatic and environmental conditions. In addition, the perennial ryegrass cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’ was chosen as a reference. The accessions were grown for 360 days in a controlled environment through six consecutive drought stress and recovery cycles. We observed intraspecific differences in drought stress responsiveness for shoot biomass and survival from the third stress cycle. An accession from Norway had 50% more shoot dry matter than the next best-performing accession after six drought cycles. Compared with the reference cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’, shoot dry matter of the accession from Norway was more than seven times higher after six drought cycles, indicating superior performance of this ecotype under drought stress. Drought tolerance was characterized by osmotic adjustment and higher relative leaf water content at low soil moisture levels. Furthermore, the findings of this study identify solute potential as an early predictor of drought stress tolerance.

&lt;i&gt;Lolium perenne&lt;/i&gt; L. (perennial ryegrass) is the most important pasture grass species in temperate regions of the world. However, its growth is restricted in summer dry environments. Germplasm screening can be used to identify accessions or individual plants for incorporation into breeding programs for drought tolerance. We selected nine perennial ryegrass accessions from different global origins and from a range of climatic and environmental conditions. In addition, the perennial ryegrass cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’ was chosen as a reference. The accessions were grown for 360 days in a controlled environment through six consecutive drought stress and recovery cycles. We observed intraspecific differences in drought stress responsiveness for shoot biomass and survival from the third stress cycle. An accession from Norway had 50% more shoot dry matter than the next best-performing accession after six drought cycles. Compared with the reference cultivar ‘Grasslands Impact’, shoot dry matter of the accession from Norway was more than seven times higher after six drought cycles, indicating superior performance of this ecotype under drought stress. Drought tolerance was characterized by osmotic adjustment and higher relative leaf water content at low soil moisture levels. Furthermore, the findings of this study identify solute potential as an early predictor of drought stress tolerance. These intraspecific differences can be used in breeding programs for the development of drought-tolerant perennial ryegrass cultivars.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194977</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eun Jeong Gong, Ji Young Lee, Suh Eun Bae, Young Soo Park, Kee Don Choi, Ho June Song, Gin Hyug Lee, Hwoon-Yong Jung, Woo Jin Jeong, Gab Jin Cheon, Jeong Hwan Yook, Byung Sik Kim&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Data on implications of a high positive titer of serum anti-&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; antibody on gastric cancer (GC) is limited. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of GC with a high serum anti-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; IgG (Hp-IgG) titer, and its association with diffuse-type GC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical and histological characteristics of 917 non-cardia GC patients who underwent gastrectomy. &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection was determined serologically by measuring Hp-IgG titer with immunoassay. Seropositive patients were divided into three groups (low-positive, mid-positive, and high-positive) according to the Hp-IgG titer value. Tumors were classified according to the Lauren criteria as diffuse or intestinal types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median age of the patients was 59.0 years, and 33.8% were female. The patents were grouped as follows: seronegative, 188 (20.5%); low-positive, 288 (31.4%); mid-positive, 290 (31.6%); and high-positive 151 (16.5%). The high-positive group was significantly younger (median age, 55.0 years), with a higher proportion of female (45.0%) and non-smokers (58.9%). The proportion of diffuse-type GC increased in the order low-, mid-, and high-positive groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, the factors associated with diffuse-type GC were younger age, female sex, non-smokers, and a high-positive Hp-IgG titer.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease and one of the leading causes of disability in young adults. Functional markers able to predict MS progression are still lacking. It is recognized that olfactory dysfunction may be an early symptom in MS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether alterations in olfactory event-related potentials could play a prognostic role in MS. Thirty patients affected by MS relapsing-remitting underwent an olfactory potential examination (T0). Three years after baseline (T1), 28 of 30 patients were clinically evaluated by expanded disability status scale. In addition, the number of Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) and the total number of relapses occurred in the last 3 years were collected. At T1, we observed a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and expanded disability status scale scores (rpb = -0.48; p = 0.009). A significant trend for a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and disease duration (rpb = -0.36; p = 0.06) and total number of relapses (rpb = -0.34; p = 0.08) was found. Only patients with olfactory potential absence showed a significant trend in the difference of the disability status scale (p = 0.06) between T0 and T1. In the sub-group of patients with reduced olfactory potential amplitude, we detected a trend for a negative correlation between the disability status scale and the amplitude of N1-P2 components more marked at T1 (r = -0.52; p = 0.06) than T0 (r = -0.47; p = 0.09). This is the first study that evaluated the prognostic role of olfactory event-related potentials in MS. Our results highlighted that olfactory alterations of MS patients were related to disability progression and, to a lesser extent, disease activity. The analysis of olfactory potential parameters confirmed the involvement in olfactory network damage of inflammatory and/or neurodegeneration processes which could predict the progressive course of the disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Olfactory dysfunction as a prognostic marker for disability progression in Multiple Sclerosis: An olfactory event related potential study</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196006</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196006</originId><fingerprint>5330c3de</fingerprint><author><name>Rosella Ciurleo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196006</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523998800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344161:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rosella Ciurleo, Lilla Bonanno, Simona De Salvo, Laura Romeo, Carmela Rifici, Edoardo Sessa, Giangaetano D’Aleo, Margherita Russo, Placido Bramanti, Silvia Marino, Fabrizia Caminiti&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Azathioprine is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. Genetic polymorphisms and activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) have been associated with azathioprine efficacy and toxicity in several populations. We investigated whether these associations also exist for ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) patients, who receive azathioprine maintenance therapy after remission induction with cyclophosphamide.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;207 AAV patients treated with cyclophosphamide induction and azathioprine maintenance therapy were included and followed for 60 months. &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype and tertiles of TPMT activity were compared to relapse free survival and occurrence of adverse events, particularly leukopenia. Multivariable regression was performed to account for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In univariable analysis, relapse free survival was not significantly associated with &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype (P = 0.41) or TPMT activity (P = 0.07), although it tended to be longer in lower tertiles of TPMT activity. There was no significant association of TPMT genotype and activity with occurrence of any adverse event. In multiple regression, leukocyte counts at the end of cyclophosphamide induction were related to risk of leukopenia during azathioprine therapy [P&amp;lt;0.001; OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.43–0.68)] and risk of relapse during follow-up [P = 0.001; HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.29)] irrespective of TMPT genotype or activity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TPMT genotype and activity were not independent predictors of relapse, and could not predict leukopenia or other adverse effects from azathioprine.

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry.

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry. The larger amplitude significantly increased bone formation (Fractional bone volume: 19.4% vs. 5.2%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; trabecular thickness: 0.1 mm vs. 0.06 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; mean spicule height: 2.6 mm vs. 1.1 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) however, no endochondral ossification occurred. The elimination of shear movement, unimpaired neovascularization as well as the tensile strain stimuli during the distraction phase suppressing chondrogenic differentiation may all contribute to the absence of cartilage. In clinical application of distraction osteogenesis, moderate axial interfragmentary movement augments intramembranous ossification provided shear strain is minimized.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195466</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stephanie A.

Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bezier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>A modelling approach for exploring muscle dynamics during cyclic contractions</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006123</link><recrawled>1523911321731</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006123</originId><fingerprint>676ade68</fingerprint><author><name>Stephanie A.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in human breast cancer and is a marker for poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Transplantation of p53 null mouse mammary epithelium into syngeneic wild-type mice leads to normal mammary gland development followed by spontaneous mammary tumors that recapitulate many of the phenotypic, molecular and genetic features of human breast cancer. Transient exposure of p53 null mice to the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen leads to sustained and robust protection against tumor development. However the mechanism underlying this anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that transient exposure to tamoxifen leads to a reduction in mammary ductal side-branching and epithelial cell proliferation after tamoxifen withdrawal. Global gene expression analysis showed that transient tamoxifen exposure leads to persistent changes in the expression of a subset of estrogen regulated gene signatures in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Among these was the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt;). We show that &lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt; is a novel tamoxifen regulated target gene which is upregulated in MECs after transient tamoxifen exposure and displays tumor suppressor activity in human breast cancer cells. Further, PTPN5 expression is strongly associated with good clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated human breast cancer patients suggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel biomarker of tamoxifen response in human breast cancer.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Reprogramming of the estrogen responsive transcriptome contributes to tamoxifen-dependent protection against tumorigenesis in the p53 null mammary epithelial cells</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194913</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194913</originId><fingerprint>33265d5b</fingerprint><author><name>Murugesan Palaniappan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194913</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424a:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Murugesan Palaniappan, David Edwards, Chad J.

Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against complement protein C5, is considered to be the current standard of care for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. This study describes the generation and preclinical attributes of ALXN1210, a new long-acting anti-C5 mAb, obtained through select modifications to eculizumab to both largely abolish target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and increase recycling efficiency via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). To attenuate the effect of TMDD on plasma terminal half-life (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;), histidine substitutions were engineered into the complementarity-determining regions of eculizumab to enhance the dissociation rate of the mAb:C5 complex in the acidic early endosome relative to the slightly basic pH of blood. Antibody variants with optimal pH-dependent binding to C5 exhibited little to no TMDD in mice in the presence of human C5. To further enhance the efficiency of FcRn-mediated recycling of the antibody, two additional substitutions were introduced to increase affinity for human FcRn. These substitutions yielded an additional doubling of the t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; of surrogate anti-mouse C5 antibodies with reduced TMDD in transgenic mice expressing the human FcRn. In conclusion, ALXN1210 is a promising new therapeutic candidate currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Design and preclinical characterization of ALXN1210: A novel anti-C5 antibody with extended duration of action</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</originId><fingerprint>715cda6d</fingerprint><author><name>Douglas Sheridan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66da:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Douglas Sheridan, Zhao-Xue Yu, Yuchun Zhang, Rekha Patel, Fang Sun, Melissa A.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Genome-wide analysis of basic helix-loop-helix superfamily members in peach</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</originId><fingerprint>5fa2e0ac</fingerprint><author><name>Chunhua Zhang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523912400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aed:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chunhua Zhang, Ruchao Feng, Ruijuan Ma, Zhijun Shen, Zhixiang Cai, Zhizhong Song, Bin Peng, Mingliang Yu&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) have always represented a public health concern in the military, yet most studies rely on self-reports among non-random samples of military populations. In addition, most of the studies exploring STI rates among the military focus on US service members. This paper assesses the prevalence and correlates of STIs in the French military using biomarkers and compares self-reported versus diagnosed STIs.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data are drawn from the COSEMIL study, a national sexual health survey conducted in the French military in 2014 and 2015. A random sample of 784 men and 141 women aged 18–57 years completed a self-administered questionnaire and provided biological samples for STI testing. We used logistic regression modeling to identify the correlates of STI diagnosis and self-reports.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of diagnosed STIs was 4.7% [3.8–5.9], mostly due to &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt;. This rate was four times higher than the 12 months self-reported rate of 1.1% [0.6–2.3]. Reported STI rates were similar among men and women (1.1% &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 1.8%), but diagnosed STI rates were twice as high among females &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; males (10.4% &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 4.1%, p = 0.007). There were significant differences in the determinants of reported &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; diagnosed STIs. In particular, age and sexual orientation were associated with reported STIs, but not with diagnosed STIs. Conversely, STI counseling and depression were associated with STI diagnosis but not with STI reports.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study underlines the need to use biomarkers in population-based surveys, given the differential and substantial underreporting of STIs. Results also highlight the need for programmatic adaptation to address gender inequalities in STI rates, by developing women’s health services in the French military. Addressing such needs not only benefits women but could also serve as a strategy to reduce overall STI rates as most military women have military partners, increasing the risk of internal transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Prevalence and risk factors of sexually transmitted infections among French service members</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195158</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195158</originId><fingerprint>2a3d4dc5</fingerprint><author><name>Sandrine Duron</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195158</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522702800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76924:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sandrine Duron, Henri Panjo, Aline Bohet, Christine Bigaillon, Sébastien Sicard, Nathalie Bajos, Jean-Baptiste Meynard, Audrey Mérens, Caroline Moreau&lt;/p&gt;

Addressing such needs not only benefits women but could also serve as a strategy to reduce overall STI rates as most military women have military partners, increasing the risk of internal transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195158</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Dissociation dynamics of 3- and 4-nitrotoluene radical cations: Coherently driven C–NO2 bond homolysis</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024892?af=R</originId><fingerprint>41603ae4</fingerprint><author><name>Derrick Ampadu Boateng</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024892?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522813577000</published><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b54:7c9981b6</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024892?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523085743269</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bhone Nay‐Htoon, Wei Xue, Steve Lindner, Matthias Cuntz, Jonghan Ko, John Tenhunen, Christiane Werner, Maren Dubbert&lt;/p&gt;
Agricultural crops play an important role in the global carbon and water cycle. Global climate change scenarios predict enhanced water scarcity and altered precipitation pattern in many parts of the world. Hence, a mechanistic understanding of water fluxes, productivity and water use efficiency of cultivated crops is of major importance, i.e. to adapt management practices. We compared water and carbon fluxes of paddy and rainfed rice by canopy scale gas exchange measurements, crop growth, daily evapotranspiration, transpiration and carbon flux modeling. Throughout a monsoon rice growing season, soil evaporation in paddy rice contributed strongly to evapotranspiration (96.6% to 43.3% from initial growth to fully developed canopy and amounted to 57.9% of total water losses over the growing seasons. Evaporation of rainfed rice was significantly lower (by 65% on average) particularly before canopy closure. Water use efficiency (WUE) was significantly higher in rainfed rice both from an agronomic (WUE&lt;sub&gt;agro&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. grain yield per evapotranspiration) and ecosystem (WUE&lt;sub&gt;eco&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. gross primary production per evapotranspiration) perspective. However, our results also show that higher WUE in rainfed rice comes at the expense of higher respiration losses compared to paddy rice (26% higher on average). Hence, suggestions on water management depend on the regional water availability (i.e. Mediterranean vs. Monsoon climate) and the balance between higher respiratory losses versus a potential reduction in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that a shift from rainfed/unsaturated soil to waterlogged paddy conditions after closure of the rice canopy might be a good compromise towards a sustainable use of water while preserving grain yield, particularly for water-limited production areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Quantifying differences in water and carbon cycling between paddy and rainfed rice (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.) by flux partitioning</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195238</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195238</originId><fingerprint>5630449</fingerprint><author><name>Bhone Nay‐Htoon</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195238</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523048400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd070:7c9981b6</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bhone Nay‐Htoon, Wei Xue, Steve Lindner, Matthias Cuntz, Jonghan Ko, John Tenhunen, Christiane Werner, Maren Dubbert&lt;/p&gt;

The peregrine falcon &lt;i&gt;Falco peregrinus&lt;/i&gt; is renowned for attacking its prey from high altitude in a fast controlled dive called a stoop. Many other raptors employ a similar mode of attack, but the functional benefits of stooping remain obscure. Here we investigate whether, when, and why stooping promotes catch success, using a three-dimensional, agent-based modeling approach to simulate attacks of falcons on aerial prey. We simulate avian flapping and gliding flight using an analytical quasi-steady model of the aerodynamic forces and moments, parametrized by empirical measurements of flight morphology. The model-birds’ flight control inputs are commanded by their guidance system, comprising a phenomenological model of its vision, guidance, and control. To intercept its prey, model-falcons use the same guidance law as missiles (pure proportional navigation); this assumption is corroborated by empirical data on peregrine falcons hunting lures. We parametrically vary the falcon’s starting position relative to its prey, together with the feedback gain of its guidance loop, under differing assumptions regarding its errors and delay in vision and control, and for three different patterns of prey motion. We find that, when the prey maneuvers erratically, high-altitude stoops increase catch success compared to low-altitude attacks, but only if the falcon’s guidance law is appropriately tuned, and only given a high degree of precision in vision and control. Remarkably, the optimal tuning of the guidance law in our simulations coincides closely with what has been observed empirically in peregrines. High-altitude stoops are shown to be beneficial because their high airspeed enables production of higher aerodynamic forces for maneuvering, and facilitates higher roll agility as the wings are tucked, each of which is essential to catching maneuvering prey at realistic response delays.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ypEvewr7kSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Physics-based simulations of aerial attacks by peregrine falcons reveal that stooping at high speed maximizes catch success against agile prey</title><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006044</link><recrawled>1523565724244</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006044</originId><fingerprint>234a5718</fingerprint><author><name>Robin Mills</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ypEvewr7kSA/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162baf3e3ad:bf9d1f:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robin Mills, Hanno Hildenbrandt, Graham K.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical significance of the laboratory-based phenomenon of clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness and platelet reactivity associated with acute myocardial infarction, despite chronic clopidogrel therapy, is largely unknown. We aimed to determine platelet reactivity and clinical and angiographic features in 29 consecutive patients sustaining an acute myocardial infarction despite chronic (≥1 month) clopidogrel therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Platelet reactivity was determined on admission using conventional aggregometry. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 24 hours of admission. Patients were matched with clopidogrel-naïve acute myocardial infarction patients.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical significance of the laboratory-based phenomenon of clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness and platelet reactivity associated with acute myocardial infarction, despite chronic clopidogrel therapy, is largely unknown. We aimed to determine platelet reactivity and clinical and angiographic features in 29 consecutive patients sustaining an acute myocardial infarction despite chronic (≥1 month) clopidogrel therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Platelet reactivity was determined on admission using conventional aggregometry. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 24 hours of admission. Patients were matched with clopidogrel-naïve acute myocardial infarction patients. Clopidogrel-naïve patients received a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose and 75 mg/day thereafter.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 29 study patients, 19 (66%) presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and in 25% the infarction was related to angiographically-proved definite stent thrombosis.

Studies conducted during the past few years have confirmed active West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in Serbia. Based on these studies and the epidemiological situation, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched national WNV surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015. The programmes encompassed the territory of Serbia and were conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the programmes was early detection of WNV and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase both clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The WNV surveillance programmes were based on direct and indirect surveillance of the presence of WNV by the serological testing of initially seronegative sentinel horses and chickens as well as through viral detection in pooled mosquito and wild bird samples. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in all seven districts of Vojvodina Province (northern Serbia) and Belgrade City, where most of the positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The West Nile virus surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015 showed satisfactory results in their capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and their sensitivity to early detect viral circulation at the enzootic level. Most of the human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation as part of the surveillance programmes. According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Methodology and results of integrated WNV surveillance programmes in Serbia</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195439</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195439</originId><fingerprint>f4d07f1d</fingerprint><author><name>Tamaš Petrović</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195439</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523048400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd079:7c9981b6</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tamaš Petrović, Milanko Šekler, Dušan Petrić, Sava Lazić, Zoran Debeljak, Dejan Vidanović, Aleksandra Ignjatović Ćupina, Gospava Lazić, Diana Lupulović, Mišo Kolarević, Budimir Plavšić&lt;/p&gt;

The authors are going over a number of areas where medicinal chemistry could make use of more advanced synthetic techniques, and they’re good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, “&lt;em&gt;From an industry perspective, the most common challenge for any new synthetic method is its level of tolerance to the polar functional groups and nitrogen heteroatoms found in biologically active molecules.&lt;/em&gt;” Yes indeed. That’s what I look at when I see a neat new transformation in the literature – what did it work on? Basic amines OK? Tertiary or secondary? Secondary amides tolerated? Carboxylic acids? Free OH groups? I’m disappointed sometimes when I find that a reaction can’t tolerate these, but I’m glad that the papers involved at least went to the trouble of finding the limits to their chemistry. Far worse than that is a paper that tiptoes around the issues of chemical compatibility, leaving you to find out for yourself – if you’re so inclined, and often one is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area identified is late-stage functionalization, C-H bond activation, etc. Those reactions are always welcome, for sure. Chemical diversity is one of the names of the game that we play, and anything that allows us to get more of it quickly and reliably is good news. Blending with the above, the more complex and functionalized the molecules that can be used as substrates for such chemistry, the better. We’ll take fluorination, hydroxylation, amination, addition of methoxy, trifluoromethyl, what have you. It’s great to be able to predict where the functionalization will happen, of course, but there’s value in things that just sort of go in and mess with structures, too: new molecules! After all, that’s what the liver enzymes do to our drugs; we’re used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also calls for new ways to synthesize and functionalize small heterocyclic rings, new metal-catalyzed coupling reactions (and new C-C bond-forming reactions in general), more biomolecule-compatible reactions, and more. It also goes briefly into machine-assisted synthesis and software-assisted retrosynthesis, but the bulk of the paper is on synthetic methods, and I can only cheer on their suggestions. These are all potential areas for academic-industrial collaboration to generate new chemistry, because everyone benefits from success in these areas (indeed, some of this collaboration goes on already for just these reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I enjoyed this paper very much, but it starts off with a claim that’s worth arguing about: “&lt;em&gt;organic synthesis is still a rate-limiting factor in drug-discovery projects&lt;/em&gt;“. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends on where you’re standing. All the synthetic limitations described above are real, and they keep us from being able to make a lot of molecules that we’d otherwise be cranking out. But (and this is a big point) it’s rarely the case that we medicinal chemists identify a tricky new structure that absolutely has to be made. That sounds odd, but it comes down to our predictive powers, which aren’t so great. We don’t generally draw some wild compound up on the hood sash and say “That’s the one, folks: find a way to make it or die trying”. We never know which is the one, so in the absence of knowing, we make the things that we can make in the ways that we can make them, and honestly, much of the time, we can manage to come up with something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more general sense, though, things like the ability to make more polar compounds reliably and quickly would probably lead to better and more structurally diverse drug candidates and screening compounds, not to mention better starting points for projects in general. We just don’t know which ones. The main examples of specific compounds I can think of are metabolites or potential metabolites, where the liver has made some new polar compound out of an existing drug candidate, and we need to make the new compound(s) for testing. Those can be tough, and sometimes the only way is to grind out small quantities by exposing the drug to liver tissue itself (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for times we can’t come up with something, I would like to believe that far more diverse and interesting sets of compounds, millions of them, would allow for real hits to be found against target classes that we currently have trouble attacking. But that remains to be proven, if it ever can be. Chemical space is so large that you can always say “Well, your compound set still wasn’t big enough – the good ones are still out there”, and there’s no way to say that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the real killers in drug discovery stem from – to put it mildly – our incomplete understanding of biology. It’s Phase II and Phase III failures that hammer us, and those happen because we don’t understand our desirable (and undesirable) mechanisms of action enough, leading to failures in efficacy and safety. Even worse, they come after a big pile of money has been spent. Compared to these problems, generating chemical matter is not as big a concern. We already generate enough chemical matter to send all sorts of stuff into the clinic, where 80 to 90% of it dies for other reasons entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic chemistry is, of course, crucial to making small-molecule drugs, and you’d think that would be enough. But as a chemist, I wish that organic synthesis were more relevant to these deep problems. But in the big picture, it isn’t quite so. Chemical biology, as a field, is an attempt to make that happen, but How to Make will never be able to answer questions of What to Make and Why.&lt;/p&gt;

These 3 miRNAs hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of cocaine addiction.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303362v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>9b1a2442</fingerprint><author><name>Ahammad, I.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303362v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524034800000</published><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162d80b4768:39961e0:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303362v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/303362</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524043040616</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cambridge Analytica controversy must spur researchers to update data ethics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica controversy must spur researchers to update data ethics, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03856-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03856-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A scandal over an academic’s use of Facebook data highlights the need for research scrutiny.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Cambridge Analytica controversy must spur researchers to update data ethics</title><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cambridge Analytica controversy must spur researchers to update data ethics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica controversy must spur researchers to update data ethics, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03856-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03856-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A scandal over an academic’s use of Facebook data highlights the need for research scrutiny.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03856-4</originId><fingerprint>bcb0968f</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03856-4</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522134000000</published><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16267de9276:617031f:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>93</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03856-4</link><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03856-4/d41586-018-03856-4_15569336.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1522161062518</crawled></item><item><title>[ASAP] Structural Characterization of a Heparan Sulfate Pentamer Interacting with LAR-Ig1-2</title><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00241/20180403/images/medium/bi-2018-00241f_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00241&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Hyperopia is a common refractive error, apparent in 25% of Europeans. Treatments include spectacles, contact lenses, laser interventions and surgery including implantable contact lenses and lens extraction. Laser treatment offers an expedient and reliable means of correcting ametropia. LASIK is well-established however SMILE (small-incision lenticule extraction) or lenticule implantation (derived from myopic laser-correction) are newer options. In this study we compared the outcomes of hyperopic LASIK, SMILE and lenticule re-implantation in a primate model at +2D/+4D treatment. While re-implantation showed the greatest regression, broadly comparable refractive results were seen at 3-months with SMILE and LASIK (&amp;lt;1.4D of intended), but a greater tendency to regression in +2D lenticule reimplantation. Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Hyperopic refractive correction by LASIK, SMILE or lenticule reimplantation in a non-human primate model</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</originId><fingerprint>11fd5c8c</fingerprint><author><name>Geraint P.

SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Retraction: Recombination spot identification Based on gapped k-mers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retraction: Recombination spot identification Based on gapped k-mers, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46940&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/srep46940&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Retraction: Recombination spot identification Based on gapped k-mers&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/0Gh9iZUl5UI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Retraction: Recombination spot identification Based on gapped k-mers</title><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Retraction: Recombination spot identification Based on gapped k-mers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retraction: Recombination spot identification Based on gapped k-mers, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46940&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/srep46940&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Retraction: Recombination spot identification Based on gapped k-mers&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/0Gh9iZUl5UI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46940</originId><fingerprint>987161c5</fingerprint><author><name>Rong Wang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/0Gh9iZUl5UI/srep46940</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521529200000</published><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16242110eff:2bef7b5:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46940</href></item></canonical><unread>False</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46940</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1521526836991</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aggressive natural killer-cell leukemia mutational landscape and drug profiling highlight JAK-STAT signaling as therapeutic target&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggressive natural killer-cell leukemia mutational landscape and drug profiling highlight JAK-STAT signaling as therapeutic target, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03987-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03987-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Aggressive natural killer-cell leukemia (ANKL) has few targeted therapies.

The maternal mortality situation is analyzed in México as an indicator that reflects the social development level of the country and was one of the millennial development objectives. The effect of a maternal death in the related social group has multiplier effects, since it involves family dislocation, economic impact and disruption of the orphans&apos; normal social development. Two perspectives that causes of maternal mortality were analyzed, on one hand, their relationship with social determinants and on the other, factors directly related to the health system. Evidence shows that comparing populations based on group of selected variables according to social conditions and health care access, statistically significant differences prevail according to education and marginalization levels, and access to medical care. In addition, the Age-Period-Cohort model raised, shows significant progress in terms of a downward trend in maternal mortality in a generational level. Those women born before 1980 had a greater probability of maternal death in relation to recent generations, which is a reflection of the improvement in social determinants and in the Health System. The age effect shows a problem in maternal mortality in women under 15 years old, so teen pregnancy is a priority in health and must be addressed in short term. There is no clear evidence of a period effect.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Maternal mortality in Mexico, beyond millennial development objectives: An age-period-cohort model</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194607</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194607</originId><fingerprint>21c0458a</fingerprint><author><name>Román Rodríguez-Aguilar</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194607</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521666000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087ee:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Román Rodríguez-Aguilar&lt;/p&gt;

Mutations in &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; have been implicated in several genetic disorders, particularly Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. In order to determine the most reliable bioinformatics tools to assess the likely pathogenicity of &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; variants, the results of bioinformatics predictions were compared to the impact of variants on &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; structure and function. The MutPred, Provean, and PMUT bioinformatic tools were found to have the highest performance in predicting the pathogenicity effects of all 18 characterized missense variants in &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt;, all with sensitivity and specificity &gt;93%. Applying these three programs to assess the likely pathogenicity of 13 previously uncharacterized &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; missense variants predicted 12/13 variants as deleterious, except A30V which was predicted as benign variant for all programs. Molecular modeling of the &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; homoedomain predicts that of the 31 known &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; variants, L54Q, F58L, V83F, V83L, W86C, W86S, and R91P alter PITX2’s structure. In contrast, the remaining 24 variants are not predicted to change PITX2’s structure. The results of molecular modeling, performed on all the &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; missense mutations located in the homeodomain, were compared with the findings of eight protein stability programs. CUPSAT was found to be the most reliable in predicting the effect of missense mutations on &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; stability. Our results showed that for &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt;, and likely other members of this homeodomain transcription factor family, MutPred, Provean, PMUT, molecular modeling, and CUPSAT can reliably be used to predict &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; missense variants pathogenicity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Accurate prediction of functional, structural, and stability changes in &amp;lt;i&gt;PITX2&amp;lt;/i&gt; mutations using &amp;lt;i&gt;in silico&amp;lt;/i&gt; bioinformatics algorithms</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195971</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195971</originId><fingerprint>4697bd96</fingerprint><author><name>Morteza Seifi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195971</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523998800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334415e:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Morteza Seifi, Michael A.

Mutations in &lt;i&gt;PITX2&lt;/i&gt; have been implicated in several genetic disorders, particularly Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.

Recent advances in culture-free microbiological techniques bring new understanding of the role of intestinal microbiota in heath and performance. Intestinal microbial communities in chickens assume a near-stable state within the week which leaves a very small window for permanent microbiota remodelling. It is the first colonisers that determine the fate of microbial community in humans and birds alike, and after the microbiota has matured there are very small odds for permanent modification as stable community resists change. In this study we inoculated broiler chicks immediately post hatch, with 3 species of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA and pheS genes as &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;agilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;reuteri&lt;/i&gt;. The strains were isolated from the gut of healthy chickens as reproducibly persistent &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; strains among multiple flocks. Birds inoculated with the probiotic mix reached significantly higher weight by 28 days of age. Although each strain was able to colonise when administered alone, administering the probiotic mix at-hatch resulted in colonisation by only &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt;. High initial abundance of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ingluviei&lt;/i&gt; was slowly reducing, however, the effects of at-hatch administration of the &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; mix on modifying microbiota development and structure remained persistent.

Competitive pressure to maximize the current bibliometric measures of productivity is jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific literature. Efforts are underway to address the ‘reproducibility crisis’ by encouraging the use of more rigorous, confirmatory methods. However, as long as productivity continues to be defined by the number of discoveries scientists publish, the impact factor of the journals they publish in and the number of times their papers are cited, they will be reluctant to accept high quality methods and consistently conduct and publish confirmatory/replication studies. This exploratory study examined a sample of rigorous Phase II-IV clinical trials, including unpublished studies, to determine if more appropriate metrics and incentives can be developed. The results suggest that rigorous procedures will help reduce false positives, but to the extent that higher quality methods are accepted as the standard of practice, the current bibliometric incentives will discourage innovative studies and encourage scientists to shift their research to less informative studies of subjects that are already being more actively investigated. However, the results also suggest that it is possible to develop a more appropriate system of rewards. In contrast to the current bibliometric incentives, evaluations of the quality of the methods and reproducibility of the results, innovation and diversity of thought, and amount of information produced may serve as measures and incentives that maintain the integrity of the scientific literature and maximize scientific progress.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Scientific productivity: An exploratory study of metrics and incentives</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195321</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195321</originId><fingerprint>c68ecb99</fingerprint><author><name>Mark D.

In keeping with China’s President Xi Jinping’s “Chinese Dream,” China has set a goal of becoming a world-class innovator by 2050. China’s higher education Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) research environment will play a pivotal role in influencing whether China is successful in transitioning from a manufacturing-based economy to an innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy. Past studies on China’s research environment have been primarily qualitative in nature or based on anecdotal evidence. In this study, we surveyed STEM faculty from China’s top 25 universities to get a clearer understanding of how faculty members view China’s overall research environment. We received 731 completed survey responses, 17% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from abroad and 83% of which were from individuals who received terminal degrees from domestic institutions of higher education. We present results on why returnees decided to study abroad, returnees’ decisions to return to China, and differences in perceptions between returnees and domestic degree holders on the advantages of having a foreign degree. The top five challenges to China’s research environment identified by survey respondents were: a promotion of short-term thinking and instant success (37% of all respondents); research funding (33%); too much bureaucratic or governmental intervention (31%); the evaluation system (27%); and a reliance on human relations (26%). Results indicated that while China has clearly made strides in its higher education system, there are numerous challenges that must be overcome before China can hope to effectively produce the kinds of innovative thinkers that are required if it is to achieve its ambitious goals. We also raise questions about the current direction of education and inquiry in China, particularly indications that government policy is turning inward, away from openness that is central to innovative thinking.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>China’s science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research environment: A snapshot</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195347</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195347</originId><fingerprint>1423b345</fingerprint><author><name>Xueying Han</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195347</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522789200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6a:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xueying Han, Richard P.

We also raise questions about the current direction of education and inquiry in China, particularly indications that government policy is turning inward, away from openness that is central to innovative thinking.</description><engagement>7</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195347</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>High-resolution infrared spectroscopy of O2H+ in a cryogenic ion trap</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023633?af=R</originId><fingerprint>78180d13</fingerprint><author><name>Hiroshi Kohguchi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023633?af=R</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1523246510000</published><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162c30cf7b9:1b852f2:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023633?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523690829753</crawled></item><item><content><content>Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for carrying electrical signals throughout the body, and mutations in these proteins are responsible for a variety of disorders, including epilepsy and pain syndromes.

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; is an important cause of infection and commonly colonizes the nasopharynx of young children, along with other potentially pathogenic bacteria. The objectives of this study were to estimate the carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moraxella catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; in young children in Indonesia, and to examine interactions between these bacterial species. 302 healthy children aged 12–24 months were enrolled in community health centers in the Bandung, Central Lombok, and Padang regions. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and stored according to World Health Organization recommendations, and bacterial species detected by qPCR. Pneumococcal serotyping was conducted by microarray and latex agglutination/Quellung. Overall carriage prevalence was 49.5% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, 27.5% for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, 42.7% for &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and 7.3% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

Following the indication of the World Health Organization, a national plan for the elimination of measles was approved in Italy and this included the improvement of the molecular surveillance of measles viruses and the interruption of indigenous transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, large outbreaks continue to occur in almost all regions of the country, including Sicily. Here we describe the epidemiology and molecular dynamics of measles viruses as a result of the measles surveillance activity carried out by the “Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella” in Sicily over a 5-year period. Biological samples of 259 suspected measles cases were tested for viral RNA detection and a total of 223 (86.1%) were classified as laboratory confirmed. The median age of confirmed measles cases was 21.0 years and about half of them were adults aged 19 years and older. Overall, one-third of the patients showed clinical complications and these latter were more common among adults than children (44.9% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 25.7%). The vast majority of measles cases were unvaccinated (94.2%, n = 210). The phylogenetic analysis of 221 measles virus nucleotide sequences revealed sporadic detections of genotypes D4 and H1, while endemic circulation of genotypes D8 and B3 was documented. Genotype D8 was associated with epidemics occurred between 2013 and 2016, whereas genotype B3 was more recently introduced into Sicily characterizing the current measles outbreak. The results of this study confirm the autochthonous co-circulation of viral variants belonging to different genotypes during the study period, and emphasizes the need of measles surveillance programmes in order to investigate the viral dynamics, the pathways of disease transmission, and to eventually adapt the development of successfull vaccine formulations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Case-based surveillance of measles in Sicily during 2012-2017: The changing molecular epidemiology and implications for vaccine strategies</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195256</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195256</originId><fingerprint>b8c64933</fingerprint><author><name>Fabio Tramuto</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195256</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522875600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f6:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Tramuto, Carmelo Massimo Maida, Fanny Pojero, Giuseppina Maria Elena Colomba, Alessandra Casuccio, Vincenzo Restivo, Francesco Vitale&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Increasing use of factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors necessitates effective reversal agents to manage bleeding. Andexanet alfa, a novel modified recombinant human FXa, rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct and indirect FXa inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the ability of andexanet to reverse anticoagulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and reduce bleeding in rabbits administered edoxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies characterized the interaction of andexanet with edoxaban and its ability to reverse edoxaban-mediated anti-FXa activity. In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Increasing use of factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors necessitates effective reversal agents to manage bleeding. Andexanet alfa, a novel modified recombinant human FXa, rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct and indirect FXa inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the ability of andexanet to reverse anticoagulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and reduce bleeding in rabbits administered edoxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies characterized the interaction of andexanet with edoxaban and its ability to reverse edoxaban-mediated anti-FXa activity. In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa. Andexanet rapidly and dose-dependently reversed the effects of edoxaban on FXa activity and coagulation pharmacodynamic parameters &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In edoxaban-anticoagulated rabbits, andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity by 82% (from 548±87 to 100±41 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), mean unbound edoxaban plasma concentration by ~80% (from 100±10 to 21±6 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), and blood loss by 80% vs. vehicle (adjusted for control, 2.6 vs. 12.9 g; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). The reduction in blood loss correlated with the decrease in anti-FXa activity (r = 0.6993, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and unbound edoxaban (r = 0.5951, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0035).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that andexanet rapidly reversed the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban, suggesting it could be clinically valuable for the management of acute and surgery-related bleeding. Correlation of blood loss with anti-FXa activity supports the use of anti-FXa activity as a biomarker for assessing anticoagulation reversal in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195122</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled></item><item><title>[ASAP] Cooperative Interactions of Three Hotspot Heparin Binding Residues Are Critical for Allosteric Activation of Antithrombin by Heparin</title><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00216/20180329/images/medium/bi-2018-00216x_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00216&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In human sleep studies, the probability of discomfort from the electrodes and the change in environment usually results in first-night recordings being discarded. Sleep recordings from the first night in human subjects often differ in amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and the overall sleep architecture. This study investigated whether recordings of sleep states in dairy cows also show a first-night effect. Non-invasive electrophysiological recordings were carried out on nine cows of the Swedish Red breed during three consecutive 24-hour periods (recording days 1–3). Overall, cows spent 12.9 ± 1.4 hours awake, 8.2 ± 1 hours ruminating, 57.2 ± 20.3 min drowsing, 44.1 ± 20.2 min in REM sleep and 64.3 ± 38.1 min in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (mean ± SD) and there were no significant differences between recording days in total duration for any of the sleep and awake states. However, the bouts of REM sleep and rumination were longer, and the awake bouts were shorter, at night time compared to daytime, regardless of recording day. The awake bouts also showed an interaction effect with longer bouts at daytime during day 1 compared to daytime on day 3. Data on sleep and awake states recorded in adult dairy cows during three consecutive 24-h periods showed great variation in sleep time between cows, but total time for each state was not significantly affected by recording day. Further and more detailed studies of how sleep architecture is affected by recording day is necessary to fully comprehend the first-night effect in dairy cows.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>First-night effect on sleep time in dairy cows</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195593</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195593</originId><fingerprint>47c60dcc</fingerprint><author><name>Emma Ternman</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195593</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523653200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793629:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Ternman, Matti Pastell, Laura Hänninen, Sigrid Agenäs, Per P.

There is a suspected but unproven association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and subjective stress, depressive disorders, health-related quality of life (QoL) and suicide. We selected 124,205 adults from the Korean Community Health Survey in 2013 who were at least 19 years old and who had lived in their current domiciles for &gt; five years. Based on the computer-assisted personal interviews to measure subjective stress in daily life, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, depression diagnosis by a doctor, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts, we evaluated the risk of mental disorders using multiple logistic regression analysis according to the quartiles of air pollutants, such as particulate matter &amp;lt;10μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, using yearly average concentration between August 2012 and July 2013. The prevalence of high stress, poor QoL, depressiveness, diagnosis of depression, and suicide ideation was positively associated with high concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO after adjusting for confounding factors. Men were at increased risk of stress, poor QoL, and depressiveness from air pollution exposure than were women. The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects &amp;lt; age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and mental health status: A nationwide population-based cross-sectional study</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</originId><fingerprint>ee5a65b4</fingerprint><author><name>Jinyoung Shin</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523307600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529c:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinyoung Shin, Jin Young Park, Jaekyung Choi&lt;/p&gt;

The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects &amp;lt; age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled></item><item><content><content>Wang and Lu (1) claim to report evidence of a genetic polymorphism of altruistic and nonaltruistic alleles in a natural population of Tibetan ground tits, Pseudopodoces humilis.

Strategic purchasing is an essential health financing function. This paper compares the strategic purchasing practices of Thailand’s two tax-financed health insurance schemes, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), and identifies factors contributing to successful universal health coverage outcomes by analysing the relationships between the purchaser and government, providers and members. The study uses a cross-sectional mixed-methods design, including document review and interviews with 56 key informants. The Comptroller General Department (CGD) of Ministry of Finance manages CSMBS as one among civil servant welfare programmes. Their purchasing is passive. Fee for service payment for outpatient care has resulted in rapid cost escalation and overspending of their annual budget. In contrast, National Health Security Office (NHSO) manages purchasing for UCS, which undertakes a range of strategic purchasing actions, including applying closed ended provider payment, promoting primary healthcare’s gate keeping functions, exercising collective purchasing power and engaging views of members in decision making process. This difference in purchasing arrangements resulted in expenditure per CSMBS member being 4 times higher than UCS in 2014. The governance of the purchaser organization, the design of the purchasing arrangements including incentives and use of information, and the institutional capacities to implement purchasing functions are essential for effective strategic purchasing which can improve health system efficiency as a whole.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Strategic purchasing and health system efficiency: A comparison of two financing schemes in Thailand</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195179</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195179</originId><fingerprint>9ee1557c</fingerprint><author><name>Walaiporn Patcharanarumol</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195179</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522702800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76928:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Walaiporn Patcharanarumol, Warisa Panichkriangkrai, Angkana Sommanuttaweechai, Kara Hanson, Yaowaluk Wanwong, Viroj Tangcharoensathien&lt;/p&gt;

A total of 21 SLAC/SLAH genes were identified from the five Rosaceae species. Based on the structural characteristics and a phylogenetic analysis of these genes, the SLAC/SLAH gene family could be classified into three main groups (I, II and III). The evolutionary analysis showed that the SLAC/SLAH gene family was comparatively conserved during the evolution of Rosaceae species. Transcriptome data demonstrated that PbrSLAC/SLAH genes were detected in all parts of the pear. However, PbrSL AC1 showed a higher expression level in leaf, while PbrSLAH2/3 was mainly expressed in roots. In addition, PbrSLAC/SLAH genes were only located on the plasma membrane in transient expression experiments in Arabidopsis protoplasts cells.

Despite this, transcriptomic analyses of the human brain have typically been conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of performing single-cell type analyses with donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary cortical cell types in previous publications. Using this database, we predicted the relative cell type composition for 833 human cortical samples using microarray or RNA-Seq data from the Pritzker Consortium (GSE92538) or publicly-available databases (GSE53987, GSE21935, GSE21138, CommonMind Consortium).

A tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant mechanism is responsible for the electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions and relaxations of &lt;i&gt;Crotalus durissus terrificus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa. Here it was investigated whether this mechanism also occurs in corpora cavernosa and aortae of the non-venomous snake &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae. Corpora cavernosa and aortic rings isolated from &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; snake were mounted in organ bath system for isometric tension recording. EFS-induced contractions in both tissues were performed in the presence and absence of guanethidine (30 μM), phentolamine (10 μM) and tetrodotoxin (1 μM). In another set of experiments, the endothelium was removed from aortic rings and EFS-induced contractions were performed in the denuded rings. Electrical field stimulation-induced contractions were frequency-dependent in &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortic rings. The contractions were significantly reduced in the presence of guanethidine (30 μM) or phentolamine (10 μM). Pre-treatment with tetrodotoxin had no effect on the EFS-induced contractions of either corpora cavernosa or aortic rings. Surprisingly, the EFS-induced contractions of aortic rings denuded of endothelium were almost abolished. These results indicate that the TTX-resistant mechanism is present in EFS-induced contractions of &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae. The experiments performed in the aorta indicate that the endothelium is the main source for the release of catecholamines induced by EFS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Electrical field stimulation-induced contractions on &amp;lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&amp;lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196123</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196123</originId><fingerprint>4ef3dd09</fingerprint><author><name>Rafael Campos</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196123</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524171600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935cb:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Campos, Fabíola Z.

Tissue refractive index provides important information about morphology at the nanoscale. Since the malignant transformation involves both intra- and inter-cellular changes in the refractive index map, the tissue disorder measurement can be used to extract important diagnosis information. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) provides a practical means of extracting this information as it maps the optical path-length difference (OPD) across a tissue sample with sub-wavelength sensitivity. In this work, we employ QPI to compare the tissue disorder strength between benign and malignant breast tissue histology samples. Our results show that disease progression is marked by a significant &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in the disorder strength. Since our imaging system can be added as an upgrading module to an existing microscope, we anticipate that it can be integrated easily in the pathology work flow.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Disorder strength measured by quantitative phase imaging as intrinsic cancer marker in fixed tissue biopsies</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194320</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194320</originId><fingerprint>ced6e04e</fingerprint><author><name>Masanori Takabayashi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194320</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521666000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e4:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masanori Takabayashi, Hassaan Majeed, Andre Kajdacsy-Balla, Gabriel Popescu&lt;/p&gt;

While there is substantial evidence that adults who violate gender stereotypes often face backlash (i.e. social and economic penalties), less is known about the nature of gender stereotypes for young children, and the penalties that children may face for violating them. We conducted three experiments, with over 2000 adults from the US, to better understand the content and consequences of adults’ gender stereotypes for young children. In Experiment 1, we tested which characteristics adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 635) believed to be descriptive (i.e. typical), prescriptive (i.e. required), and proscriptive (i.e. forbidden) for preschool-aged boys and girls. Using the characteristics that were rated in Experiment 1, we then constructed vignettes that were either ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’, and manipulated whether the vignettes were said to describe a boy or a girl. Experiment 2 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 697) revealed that adults rated stereotype-violating children as less likeable than their stereotype-conforming peers, and that this difference was more robust for boys than girls. Experiment 3 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 731) was a direct replication of Experiment 2, and revealed converging evidence of backlash against stereotype-violating children. In sum, our results suggest that even young children encounter backlash from adults for stereotype violations, and that these effects may be strongest for boys.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Backlash against gender stereotype-violating preschool children</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195503</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195503</originId><fingerprint>40cae228</fingerprint><author><name>Jessica Sullivan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195503</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523307600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715290:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Sullivan, Corinne Moss-Racusin, Michael Lopez, Katherine Williams&lt;/p&gt;

The natural alkaloid berberine has been ascribed numerous health benefits including lipid and cholesterol reduction and improved insulin sensitivity in diabetics. However, oral (PO) administration of berberine is hindered by poor bioavailability and increasing dose often elicits gastro-intestinal side effects. To overcome the caveats associated with oral berberine, we developed transdermal (TD) formulations of berberine (BBR) and the berberine precursor dihydroberberine (DHB). These formulations were compared to oral BBR using pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and general safety studies &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To complete this work, a sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated according the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods to simultaneously measure berberine, simvastatin, and simvastatin hydroxy acid with relative quantification used for the berberine metabolite demethylene berberine glucuronide (DBG). Acute pharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated a statistically relevant ranking for berberine bioavailability based upon AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-8&lt;/sub&gt; as DHB TD &gt; BBR TD &gt;&gt; BBR PO with similar ranking for the metabolite DBG, indicating that transdermal administration achieves BBR levels well above oral administration. Similarly, chronic administration (14 days) resulted in significantly higher levels of circulating BBR and DBG in DHB TD treated animals. Chronically treated rats were given a single dose of simvastatin with no observed change in the drugs bioavailability compared with control, suggesting the increased presence of BBR had no effect on simvastatin metabolism. This observation was further supported by consistent CYP3A4 expression across all treatment groups. Moreover, no changes in kidney and liver biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, were observed between treatment formats, and confirming previous reports that BBR has no effect on HMG-CoA expression. This study supports the safe use of transdermal compositions that improve on the poor bioavailability of oral berberine and have the potential to be more efficacious in the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Comparative pharmacokinetics and safety assessment of transdermal berberine and dihydroberberine</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194979</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194979</originId><fingerprint>2548997e</fingerprint><author><name>Beth Buchanan</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194979</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0ae6:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beth Buchanan, Qingfang Meng, Mathieu-Marc Poulin, Jonathan Zuccolo, Chike Godwin Azike, Joseph Gabriele, David Charles Baranowski&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract &lt;p&gt;Meta-research is research about research. Meta-research may not be as click-worthy as a meta-pug—a pug dog dressed up in a pug costume—but it is crucial to understanding research. A particularly valuable contribution of meta-research is to identify biases in a body of evidence. Bias can occur in the design, conduct, or publication of research and is a systematic deviation from the truth in results or inferences. The findings of meta-research can tell us which evidence to trust and what must be done to improve future research.

We should be using meta-research to provide the evidence base for implementing systemic changes to improve research, not for discrediting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dx20SHTzNfY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><engagement>3</engagement><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005972</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><crawled>1522691040056</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shin-Lin Chiu, Mei-Jih Gee, Chih-Hsin Muo, Chiao-Lee Chu, Shou-Jen Lan, Chiu-Liang Chen&lt;/p&gt;
Various sociocultural factors affect healthcare-seeking behaviors. In Taiwanese society, superstitions and lunar festivals play important roles in people’s lives. We investigated the impact of “Ghost Month” (the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month) and Chinese New Year (the 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month and the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month of the following year) on the number of elective surgeries and emergent surgeries in Taiwan. The number of total knee replacement (TKR) surgeries and proximal femur fracture (PFF) surgeries in each lunar month from 2000 to 2011 were extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, a computerized and population-based database. Patients were then sorted by location of residence or gender. The average number of TKR surgeries performed was significantly lower during the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months in urban areas, whereas in rural areas this trend was only evident in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months. There was however, no significant difference in the average number of PFF surgeries in each lunar month except for an increase seen in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; lunar month in rural patients (p&amp;lt;0.05). When sorted by gender, the average number of TKR surgeries was significantly decreased in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months in male patients, and decreased in the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months in female patients. In contrast, there was no difference in the average numbers of PFF surgeries in the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; lunar months either in male or female patients. We proposed that the timing of elective surgeries such as TKR might be influenced by Ghost Month and Chinese New Year; however, emergent PFF surgeries were not significantly influenced by sociocultural beliefs and taboos in Taiwan.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The sociocultural effects on orthopedic surgeries in Taiwan</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195183</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195183</originId><fingerprint>4f2d4b92</fingerprint><author><name>Shin-Lin Chiu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195183</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde27:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shin-Lin Chiu, Mei-Jih Gee, Chih-Hsin Muo, Chiao-Lee Chu, Shou-Jen Lan, Chiu-Liang Chen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium abscessus&lt;/i&gt;, a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium, are increasingly present in soft tissue infections and chronic lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, and infections are characterized by growth in neutrophil-rich environments. &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; is observed as two distinct smooth and rough morphotypes. The environmental smooth morphotype initiates infection and has a relatively limited ability to activate neutrophils. The rough morphotype has increased virulence and immunogenicity. However, the neutrophil response to the rough morphotype has not been explored. Killing of the smooth and rough strains, including cystic fibrosis clinical isolates, was equivalent. Neutrophil uptake of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; was similar between morphotypes. Mechanistically, both rough and smooth morphotypes enhanced neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation but inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity did not affect &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; viability. However, inhibition of phagocytosis and extracellular traps reduced killing of the smooth morphotype with lesser effects against the rough morphotype. Neutrophils treated with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; released a heat-labile mycobactericidal activity against the rough morphotype, but the activity was heat-tolerant against the smooth morphotype. Overall, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;abscessus&lt;/i&gt; stimulates ineffective neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation, and key mechanisms differ in killing of the smooth (phagocytosis-dependent, extracellular traps, and heat-tolerant secreted factor) and rough (extracellular traps and a heat-labile secreted factor) morphotypes.

Two plasma devices at atmospheric pressure (air dielectric barrier discharge and helium plasma jet) have been used to study the early germination of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; seeds during the first days. Then, plasma activated waters are used during the later stage of plant development and growth until 42 days. The effects on both testa and endospserm ruptures during the germination stage are significant in the case of air plasma due to its higher energy and efficiency of producing reactive oxygen species than the case of helium plasma. The latter has shown distinct effects only for testa rupture. Analysis of germination stimulations are based on specific stainings for reactive oxygen species production, peroxidase activity and also membrane permeability tests. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown a smoother seed surface for air plasma treated seeds that can explain the plasma induced-germination. During the growth stage, plants were watered using 4 kinds of water (tap and deionized waters activated or not by the low temperature plasma jet). With regards to other water kinds, the characterization of the tap water has shown a larger conductivity, acidity and concentration of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Only the tap water activated by the plasma jet has shown a significant effect on the plant growth. This effect could be correlated to reactive nitrogen species such as nitrite/nitrate species present in plasma activated tap water.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Effects of low temperature plasmas and plasma activated waters on &amp;lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&amp;lt;/i&gt; germination and growth</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195512</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195512</originId><fingerprint>fa5a3ed9</fingerprint><author><name>Maxime Bafoil</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195512</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523307600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715291:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maxime Bafoil, Achraf Jemmat, Yves Martinez, Nofel Merbahi, Olivier Eichwald, Christophe Dunand, Mohammed Yousfi&lt;/p&gt;

Often these transcripts are processed (spliced, capped, polyadenylated) and some are known to have important biological functions. However, most lncRNAs have unknown or poorly understood functions. Nevertheless, because of their potential role in cancer, lncRNAs are receiving a lot of attention, and the need for computational tools to predict their possible mechanisms of action is more than ever. Fundamentally, most of the known lncRNA mechanisms involve RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions. Through accurate predictions of each kind of interaction and integration of these predictions, it is possible to elucidate potential mechanisms for a given lncRNA. Approach: Here we introduce MechRNA, a pipeline for corroborating RNA-RNA interaction prediction and protein binding prediction for identifying possible lncRNA mechanisms involving specific targets or on a transcriptome-wide scale. The first stage uses a version of IntaRNA2 with added functionality for efficient prediction of RNA-RNA interactions with very long input sequences, allowing for large-scale analysis of lncRNA interactions with little or no loss of optimality. The second stage integrates protein binding information pre-computed by GraphProt, for both the lncRNA and the target. The final stage involves inferring the most likely mechanism for each lncRNA/target pair. This is achieved by generating candidate mechanisms from the predicted interactions, the relative locations of these interactions and correlation data, followed by selection of the most likely mechanistic explanation using a combined p-value. Results: We applied MechRNA on a number of recently identified cancer-related lncRNAs (PCAT1, PCAT29, ARLnc1) and also on two well-studied lncRNAs (PCA3 and 7SL). This led to the identification of hundreds of high confidence potential targets for each lncRNA and corresponding mechanisms. These predictions include the known competitive mechanism of 7SL with HuR for binding on the tumor suppressor TP53, as well as mechanisms expanding what is known about PCAT1 and ARLn1 and their targets BRCA2 and AR, respectively. For PCAT1-BRCA2, the mechanism involves competitive binding with HuR, which we confirmed using HuR immunoprecipitation assays.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>MechRNA: prediction of lncRNA mechanisms from RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><description>Motivation: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not get translated into proteins.

Background &lt;p&gt;Many mathematical models have investigated the population-level impact of expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART), using different assumptions about HIV disease progression on ART and among ART dropouts. We evaluated the influence of these assumptions on model projections of the number of infections and deaths prevented by expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A new dynamic model of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) was developed, which incorporated each of four alternative assumptions about disease progression used in previous models: (A) ART slows disease progression; (B) ART halts disease progression; (C) ART reverses disease progression by increasing CD4 count; (D) ART reverses disease progression, but disease progresses rapidly once treatment is stopped. The model was independently calibrated to HIV prevalence and ART coverage data from the United States under each progression assumption in turn. New HIV infections and HIV-related deaths averted over 10 years were compared for fixed ART coverage increases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Little absolute difference (&amp;lt;7 percentage points (pp)) in HIV infections averted over 10 years was seen between progression assumptions for the same increases in ART coverage (varied between 33% and 90%) if ART dropouts reinitiated ART at the same rate as ART-naïve MSM. Larger differences in the predicted fraction of HIV-related deaths averted were observed (up to 15pp). However, if ART dropouts could only reinitiate ART at CD4&amp;lt;200 cells/μl, assumption C predicted substantially larger fractions of HIV infections and deaths averted than other assumptions (up to 20pp and 37pp larger, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Different disease progression assumptions on and post-ART interruption did not affect the fraction of HIV infections averted with expanded ART, unless ART dropouts only re-initiated ART at low CD4 counts. Different disease progression assumptions had a larger influence on the fraction of HIV-related deaths averted with expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Influence of model assumptions about HIV disease progression after initiating or stopping treatment on estimates of infections and deaths averted by scaling up antiretroviral therapy</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194220</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194220</originId><fingerprint>58760b3b</fingerprint><author><name>Kanes Sucharitakul</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194220</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521493200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f1:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kanes Sucharitakul, Marie-Claude Boily, Dobromir Dimitrov, Kate M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Governments have an ethical imperative to safeguard children in residential care institutions at all times, including in the aftermath of an emergency. Yet, a lack of accurate data about how the magnitude and characteristics of this population may change due to an emergency impedes leaders’ ability to formulate responsive policies and services, mobilize resources and foster accountability. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the feasibility of evaluating movement of children into residential care following an emergency.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The pilot study took place in Les Cayes commune in the Sud Department of Haiti in April 2017. Six months prior to the pilot, the area was severely affected by Hurricane Matthew, with widespread devastation to property, livestock and livelihoods. Using a two-stage process, the team created a comprehensive list of residential care institutions in Les Cayes. At each facility, the data collectors attempted to administer four separate tools: a group count tool, a record review tool, interviews with staff, and interviews with children 10 years of age and older.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 27 known institutions in Les Cayes, 22 institutions consented to participate in the research. Within these 22 institutions, the prevalence of new arrivals to residential care since Hurricane Matthew varied significantly across the four tools, ranging from 0.69% according to the aggregated child interviews to 20.96% according to the aggregated staff interviews. Record availability and quality was very poor and child participation was difficult to arrange due to travel and scheduling constraints.&lt;/p&gt; Interpretation &lt;p&gt;Robust measurement of new arrivals to residential care institutions was not feasible in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew. Moreover, many of the challenges encountered are likely to be encountered in humanitarian emergencies in other settings. Therefore, the research team does not recommend scale-up of these methods in most humanitarian settings. Alternative approaches that incorporate household survey methods to ascertain movement into residential care based on reports from caregivers may be more realistic in places with poor pre-existing governance systems and weak registries and records for residential care institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Measuring movement into residential care institutions in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew: A pilot study</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195515</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195515</originId><fingerprint>87374801</fingerprint><author><name>Beth L.

Wind has a significant effect on the control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), resulting in changes in their ground speed and direction, which has an important influence on the results of integrated optimization of UAV task allocation and path planning. The objective of this integrated optimization problem changes from minimizing flight distance to minimizing flight time. In this study, the Euclidean distance between any two targets is expanded to the Dubins path length, considering the minimum turning radius of fixed-wing UAVs. According to the vector relationship between wind speed, UAV airspeed, and UAV ground speed, a method is proposed to calculate the flight time of UAV between targets. On this basis, a variable-speed Dubins path vehicle routing problem (VS-DP-VRP) model is established with the purpose of minimizing the time required for UAVs to visit all the targets and return to the starting point. By designing a crossover operator and mutation operator, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, the results of which show that an effective UAV task allocation and path planning solution under steady wind can be provided.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Integrated optimization of unmanned aerial vehicle task allocation and path planning under steady wind</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</originId><fingerprint>5e6e4f2a</fingerprint><author><name>He Luo</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521666000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087f2:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by He Luo, Zhengzheng Liang, Moning Zhu, Xiaoxuan Hu, Guoqiang Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Leukemic cells often carry chromosome aberrations which generate chimeric genes of pathogenetic, diagnostic, and prognostic importance. New rearrangements giving rise to novel fusion genes define hitherto unrecognized genetic leukemia subgroups. G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular genetic analyses were done on bone marrow cells from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and secondary myelodysplasia. The G-banding analysis revealed the karyotype 46,XX,del(21)(q22)[9]/46,XX[2]. FISH on metaphase spreads with a &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; break apart probe demonstrated that part of &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; (from 21q22) had moved to chromosome band 5p15. RNA sequencing showed in-frame fusion of &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; (from 5p15), something that was verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing.

Leukemic cells often carry chromosome aberrations which generate chimeric genes of pathogenetic, diagnostic, and prognostic importance. New rearrangements giving rise to novel fusion genes define hitherto unrecognized genetic leukemia subgroups. G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular genetic analyses were done on bone marrow cells from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and secondary myelodysplasia. The G-banding analysis revealed the karyotype 46,XX,del(21)(q22)[9]/46,XX[2]. FISH on metaphase spreads with a &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; break apart probe demonstrated that part of &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; (from 21q22) had moved to chromosome band 5p15. RNA sequencing showed in-frame fusion of &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; (from 5p15), something that was verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing. Further FISH analyses with &lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; home-made break apart/double fusion probes showed a red signal (&lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt;) on chromosome 5, a green signal on chromosome 21 (&lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt;), and two yellow fusion signals, one on der(5) and the other on der(21). Reassessment of the G-banding preparations in light of the FISH and RNA-sequencing data thus yielded the karyotype 46,XX,t(5;21)(p15;q22)[9]/46,XX[2]. The t(5;21)(p15;q22)/&lt;i&gt;RUNX1-PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; was detected only by performing molecular studies of the leukemic cells, but should be sought after also in other leukemic/myelodysplastic cases with del(21q).</description><unread>True</unread><updated>1524171600000</updated><crawled>1524159904718</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16196&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/T66k2hUTN34&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC</title><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16196&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Simultaneous overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signalling by miR-128-3p confers chemoresistance-associated metastasis in NSCLC&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/T66k2hUTN34&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196</originId><fingerprint>e5ca8a41</fingerprint><author><name>Junchao Cai</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/T66k2hUTN34/ncomms16196</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522393200000</published><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162764edef1:7865ba5:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16196</link><crawled>1522403303153</crawled></item><item><title>SERS Comparison from Au, Ag, and Au-Ag Alloys: Insights by the First Principles</title><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><description>Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is presented via a case study of 2,2’-bipyridyl(22BPY) molecules adsorbed on pure Au and Ag as well as on Au-Ag alloy nanodiscs.

Ascorbic acid (AsA), chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and their associated gene expression patterns were analysed in &lt;i&gt;Actinidia chinensis&lt;/i&gt; ‘Hongyang’ outer pericarp.

Skeletal muscle (SM) health and integrity is dependent on the dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation, and central to this process is the availability of amino acids (AA) in the amino pool. While Doxorubicin (DOX) remains one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies, little is known of the effect of the drug on SM, particularly its effect on the availability of amino acids in the tissue. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of DOX administration on vascular, interstitial and intracellular concentrations of AA in SM of the rat up to 8 days after the administration of a 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg i.p. dose of DOX. In the plasma, total amino acids (TAA) were significantly increased compared to control where greater (P&amp;lt;0.05) concentrations were observed following the 1.5 mg/kg dose compared to the 4.5 mg/kg dose. Compared to control, the 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in an increase (P&amp;lt;0.05) in interstitial TAA whereas the 4.5 mg/kg resulted in a sustained decrease (P&amp;lt;0.05). Intracellular TAA, essential amino acids (EAA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) where significantly increased in each muscle group analyzed, following the 1.5 and 4.5 mg/kg doses compared to control.

Skeletal muscle (SM) health and integrity is dependent on the dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation, and central to this process is the availability of amino acids (AA) in the amino pool. While Doxorubicin (DOX) remains one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies, little is known of the effect of the drug on SM, particularly its effect on the availability of amino acids in the tissue. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of DOX administration on vascular, interstitial and intracellular concentrations of AA in SM of the rat up to 8 days after the administration of a 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg i.p. dose of DOX. In the plasma, total amino acids (TAA) were significantly increased compared to control where greater (P&amp;lt;0.05) concentrations were observed following the 1.5 mg/kg dose compared to the 4.5 mg/kg dose. Compared to control, the 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in an increase (P&amp;lt;0.05) in interstitial TAA whereas the 4.5 mg/kg resulted in a sustained decrease (P&amp;lt;0.05).

From whole organisms to individual cells, responses to environmental conditions are influenced by genetic makeup, where the effect of genetic variation on a trait depends on the environmental context. RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic and environmental effects. In this study, we explore opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to discover &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting genotype-environment interactions (GxE)—genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Interactions between genetic variation and cellular environment in skeletal muscle gene expression</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195788</originId><fingerprint>278c3df4</fingerprint><author><name>D.

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins.

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system to bimolecular complementation (‘EM split-fluorescent protein’), for localisation of protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrmHIECypRw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><engagement>9</engagement><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005473</href></item></canonical><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><crawled>1522950975641</crawled></item><item><title>News at a glance</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/134?rss=1</originId><keywords><item>Scientific Community</item></keywords><fingerprint>a63d1b7f</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/134?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523554635000</published><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:feceb2:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/134?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/134.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556775856</crawled></item><item><title>[ASAP] MELD-Path Efficiently Computes Conformational Transitions, Including Multiple and Diverse Paths</title><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.7b01294/20180321/images/medium/ct-2017-01294h_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01294&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;In patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction is frequent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis seems to be linked to autonomic dysfunction. This study investigates the role of autonomic dysfunction assessed by Heart Rate Turbulence (HRT) analyses in patients with liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and patients &lt;p&gt;Inclusion criteria was (1) diagnosis of cirrhosis by clinical, imaging or biopsy and (2) evaluation by standard 12-lead-ECG and 24h holter monitoring and (3) at least 3 premature ventricular contractions. The exclusion criterion was presence of cardiac diseases, independent of liver cirrhosis. Biochemical parameters were analysed using standard methods. HRT was assessed using Turbulence onset (TO) and slope (TS). The endpoint was deterioration of liver cirrhosis defined as increased MELD and readmission for complications of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 122 cirrhotic patients, 82 patients (63% male) with median Child score of 6 (range 5–12) and median MELD score of 10 (range 6–32) were included. Increasing Child score, INR and decreasing albumin were correlated with TO. In addition, decompensated patients with ascites showed more abnormal TO and TS.

Background &lt;p&gt;In patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction is frequent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis seems to be linked to autonomic dysfunction. This study investigates the role of autonomic dysfunction assessed by Heart Rate Turbulence (HRT) analyses in patients with liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and patients &lt;p&gt;Inclusion criteria was (1) diagnosis of cirrhosis by clinical, imaging or biopsy and (2) evaluation by standard 12-lead-ECG and 24h holter monitoring and (3) at least 3 premature ventricular contractions. The exclusion criterion was presence of cardiac diseases, independent of liver cirrhosis. Biochemical parameters were analysed using standard methods. HRT was assessed using Turbulence onset (TO) and slope (TS). The endpoint was deterioration of liver cirrhosis defined as increased MELD and readmission for complications of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 122 cirrhotic patients, 82 patients (63% male) with median Child score of 6 (range 5–12) and median MELD score of 10 (range 6–32) were included. Increasing Child score, INR and decreasing albumin were correlated with TO. In addition, decompensated patients with ascites showed more abnormal TO and TS. During the observation period, patients with more abnormal TO showed significantly higher rate of rising MELD Score at 6 months (p = 0.03). Nevertheless, at least in our collective HRT-parameters were not independent predictors of deterioration of cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Parameters of HRT are closely associated with deterioration of cirrhosis and might be helpful in its prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195631</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;The tumor suppressor p53 is often inactivated via its interaction with endogenous inhibitors mouse double minute 4 homolog (MDM4 or MDMX) or mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), which are frequently overexpressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers.

Background &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to conduct an indirect treatment comparison between cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel relative to comparators in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who progress on docetaxel-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the network meta-analysis of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, studies with a comparator arm of best supportive care were included in the analysis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events were compared within both Bayesian and Frequentist frameworks. The ratios for survival outcomes were estimated using hazard ratios (HR), and the ratios for adverse events between groups were estimated using odds ratios (ORs); uncertainty was reported as 95% confidence (Frequentist) and credible (Baysesian) Intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three of thirteen trials identified for abstraction were relevant for analyses. Median overall survival was not statistically significantly different for abiraterone (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.83–1.28) or enzalutamide (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69–1.11) when compared to cabazitaxel in the Bayesian analysis. Anaemia (OR = 3.71; 95% CI = 1.01–10.44), diarrhoea (OR = 16.60; 95% CI = 1.41–75.31) and haematuria (OR = 3.88; 95% CI = 1.03–10.09) were more likely to occur in the cabazitaxel group than the abiraterone group, while pyrexia risk was higher in cabazitaxel compared to enzalutamide (OR = 36.23; 95% CI = 1.14–206.40). Frequentist analyses produced similar results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The scarcity of clinical studies and lack of a common comparator limited analyses. The adverse event results must be interpreted with caution as many were based on small numbers. The results from this analysis indicate comparable survival outcomes and adverse event profiles. As these pivotal studies may not reflect the contemporary treatment landscape and patient profiles, additional research, including head-to-head clinical trials and real world observational studies, should be conducted to further elucidate the beneficial effects of these therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Indirect treatment comparison of cabazitaxel for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have been previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195790</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195790</originId><fingerprint>1d131747</fingerprint><author><name>Jon P.

Random fluctuations in the amount of cellular components like mRNA and protein molecules are inevitable due to the stochastic and discrete nature of biochemical reactions. If large enough, this so-called “cellular noise” can lead to random transitions between the expression states of a multistable genetic circuit. That way, heterogeneity within isogenic populations is created. Our aim is to understand which dynamical features of a simple autoregulatory system determine its intrinsic noise level, and how they can be modified in order to regulate state-transitions. To that end, novel mathematical methods for the state-dependent characterization and prediction of noise in multistable systems are developed. First, we introduce the hybrid LNA, a modified version of the Linear Noise Approximation. It yields good predictions on variances of mRNA and protein fluctuations, even for reaction systems comprising low-copy-number components (e.g. mRNA) and highly nonlinear reaction rates. Furthermore, the temporal structure of fluctuations and the skewness of the protein distribution are characterized via state-dependent protein burst sizes and burst frequencies. Based on this mathematical framework, we develop graphical methods which support the intuitive design of regulatory circuits with a desired noise pattern. The methods are then used to predict how overall noise in the system can be adapted, and how state-specific noise modifications are possible that allow, e.g., the generation of unidirectional transitions. Our considerations are validated by stochastic simulations. This way, a design of genetic circuits is possible that takes population heterogeneity into account and is valuable in applications of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Moreover, natural phenomena like the bimodal development of genetic competence can be studied.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Characterization of noise in multistable genetic circuits reveals ways to modulate heterogeneity</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194779</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194779</originId><fingerprint>2ebafd65</fingerprint><author><name>Sayuri Katharina Hortsch</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194779</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f8:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Katharina Hortsch, Andreas Kremling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (ASSNAC) was shown in our previous study to activate Nrf2-mediated processes and increase glutathione level and resistance to oxidative stress in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we explored the antioxidant protective effect of ASSNAC in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans)&lt;/i&gt;. Treatment of &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours). In addition, ASSNAC (2 mM; 24 hours) treatment of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; strains N2 (wild type strain), &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter (CL2166) and temperature sensitive sterile strain (CF512) significantly increased GST enzyme activity by 1.9-, 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively. ASSNAC (2.0 mM; 24 hours) increased the reduced glutathione content in N2 and CF512 strains by 5.9- and 4.9-fold, respectively. Exposure of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; (N2 strain) to a lethal concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.5 mM; 120 min) resulted in death of 88% of the nematodes while pretreatment with ASSNAC (24 hours) reduced nematodes death in a concentration-dependent manner down to 8% at 2.0 mM. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes (strain CF512) cultured on agar plates containing ASSNAC (0.5 to 5.0 mM) demonstrated a significant increase in lifespan compared to control (mean lifespan 26.45 ± 0.64 versus 22.90 ± 0.59 days; log-rank p ≤ 0.001 at 2.0 mM) with a maximal lifespan of 40 versus 36 days. In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;S&amp;lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&amp;lt;i&gt;N&amp;lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine protects against oxidative stress and extends lifespan in &amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194780</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194780</originId><fingerprint>4b507ec5</fingerprint><author><name>Naphtali Savion</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194780</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522098000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f9:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naphtali Savion, Amir Levine, Shlomo Kotev-Emeth, Ulrike Bening Abu-Shach, Limor Broday&lt;/p&gt;

In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194780</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled></item><item><title>The future of artisanal fishing</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/161?rss=1</originId><keywords><item>Oceanography</item></keywords><fingerprint>b8f66352</fingerprint><author><name>Pauly, D.</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/161?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523554635000</published><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fecea1:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/161.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>11</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/161?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Retraction: SETDB1 Is Involved in Postembryonic DNA Methylation and Gene Silencing in &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194869</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194869</originId><fingerprint>df3b76cb</fingerprint><author><name>The PLOS ONE Editors</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194869</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521579600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37c4:9f3b30f2</id><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194869</canonicalUrl><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1521567726732</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How philosophy was squeezed out of the PhD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How philosophy was squeezed out of the PhD, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04051-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04051-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;How philosophy was squeezed out of the PhD</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>How philosophy was squeezed out of the PhD</title><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How philosophy was squeezed out of the PhD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How philosophy was squeezed out of the PhD, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04051-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04051-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;How philosophy was squeezed out of the PhD</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04051-1</originId><fingerprint>1e6ba784</fingerprint><author><name>Michael  Stocker</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04051-1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522825200000</published><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162908f2b70:9a0228c:7d6c1c1c</id><engagement>58</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04051-1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522843724656</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ah-Ra Lyu, Dong Hyun Kim, Seung Hun Lee, Dong-Sik Shin, Sun-Ae Shin, Yong-Ho Park&lt;/p&gt;
Preservation of residual hearing after cochlear implant is an important issue with regards to hearing performance. Various methods of steroid administration have been widely used in clinical practice to reduce inflammation and preserve residual hearing. Here we compare the effect of different routes of dexamethasone administration on intracochlear inflammation and residual hearing in guinea pig ears. Dexamethasone was delivered into the guinea pigs either through intracochlear, intratympanic or systemic route. The intracochlear concentration of dexamethasone, residual hearing, inflammatory cytokines and histopathologic changes were evaluated over time. A higher intracochlear dexamethasone concentration was observed after intracochlear administration than through the other routes. Residual hearing was better preserved with local dexamethasone administration as was supported by the reduced inflammatory cytokines, more hair cell survival and less severe intracochlear fibrosis and ossification concurrently seen in the local delivery group than in the systemic group. The results demonstrate that local dexamethasone delivery can reduce intracochlear inflammation and preserve residual hearing better than in systemically administered dexamethasone.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Effects of dexamethasone on intracochlear inflammation and residual hearing after cochleostomy: A comparison of administration routes</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</originId><fingerprint>7d78ed53</fingerprint><author><name>Ah-Ra Lyu</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195230</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522443600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c59:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ah-Ra Lyu, Dong Hyun Kim, Seung Hun Lee, Dong-Sik Shin, Sun-Ae Shin, Yong-Ho Park&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Access to medicines without prescription is a major contributing factor for self-medication practices. This study was designed to examine the ratio of non-prescribed medicines sales and self-medication practices in Punjab, Pakistan. This study also evaluates the reasons for self-medication within its communities.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An observational study was conducted in 272 systemically selected pharmacies to analyze medicines-related sales, with or without prescription. A cross-sectional survey was performed between June 2015 and November 2016. Consumers were interviewed about their self-medication practices.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the pharmacies surveyed, 65.3% participated in the study. A total of 4348 medicines were purchased for self-medication by 3037 consumers (15.2% of all study participants), of which 873 (28.7%) participated in an interview. Majority (81.2%) medicine purchaser, (90.9%) interview participants, and (59.4%) drug users were male. On average, each community pharmacy sold 7.9 medicines without prescription each day, to an average of 5.5 customers. Many participants (28.9%) had matriculation in their formal education. The medicines most often sold for self-medication were analgesics and antipyretics(39.4%). More than 25% of participants reported fever symptoms and 47.8% assumed their illness was too trivial to consult a doctor. Media advertisements were the most common source of information for participants (46.7%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many types of medicines were often sold without prescription from community pharmacies. Self-medication was common practice for a wide range of illnesses. Pakistan also needs effective implementation of policies to monitor medication sales.

The fornicata (fornicates) is a eukaryotic group known to consist of free-living and parasitic organisms. Genome datasets of two model fornicate parasites &lt;i&gt;Giardia intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spironucleus salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are well annotated, so far. The nuclear genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; assemblages and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are small in terms of the genome size and simple in genome structure. However, an ancestral genomic structure and gene contents, from which genomes of the fornicate parasites have evolved, remains to be clarified. In order to understand genome evolution in fornicates, here, we present the draft genome sequence of a free-living fornicate, &lt;i&gt;Kipferlia bialata&lt;/i&gt;, the divergence of which is earlier than those of the fornicate parasites, and compare it to the genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;. Our data show that the number of protein genes and introns in &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome are the most abundant in the genomes of three fornicates, reflecting an ancestral state of fornicate genome evolution.

Numerical models for simulating outbreaks of infectious diseases are powerful tools for informing surveillance and control strategy decisions. However, large-scale spatially explicit models can be limited by the amount of computational resources they require, which poses a problem when multiple scenarios need to be explored to provide policy recommendations. We introduce an easily implemented method that can reduce computation time in a standard Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model without introducing any further approximations or truncations. It is based on a hierarchical infection process that operates on entire groups of spatially related nodes (cells in a grid) in order to efficiently filter out large volumes of susceptible nodes that would otherwise have required expensive calculations. After the filtering of the cells, only a subset of the nodes that were originally at risk are then evaluated for actual infection. The increase in efficiency is sensitive to the exact configuration of the grid, and we describe a simple method to find an estimate of the optimal configuration of a given landscape as well as a method to partition the landscape into a grid configuration.

Numerical models for simulating outbreaks of infectious diseases are powerful tools for informing surveillance and control strategy decisions. However, large-scale spatially explicit models can be limited by the amount of computational resources they require, which poses a problem when multiple scenarios need to be explored to provide policy recommendations. We introduce an easily implemented method that can reduce computation time in a standard Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model without introducing any further approximations or truncations. It is based on a hierarchical infection process that operates on entire groups of spatially related nodes (cells in a grid) in order to efficiently filter out large volumes of susceptible nodes that would otherwise have required expensive calculations. After the filtering of the cells, only a subset of the nodes that were originally at risk are then evaluated for actual infection. The increase in efficiency is sensitive to the exact configuration of the grid, and we describe a simple method to find an estimate of the optimal configuration of a given landscape as well as a method to partition the landscape into a grid configuration. To investigate its efficiency, we compare the introduced methods to other algorithms and evaluate computation time, focusing on simulated outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) on the farm population of the USA, the UK and Sweden, as well as on three randomly generated populations with varying degree of clustering. The introduced method provided up to 500 times faster calculations than pairwise computation, and consistently performed as well or better than other available methods. This enables large scale, spatially explicit simulations such as for the entire continental USA without sacrificing realism or predictive power.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Oiar5aQKyTU&quot;

Background &lt;p&gt;Initiated in 2016, &lt;i&gt;End Hep C SF&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive initiative to eliminate hepatitis C (HCV) infection in San Francisco. The introduction of direct-acting antivirals to treat and cure HCV provides an opportunity for elimination. To properly measure progress, an estimate of baseline HCV prevalence, and of the number of people in various subpopulations with active HCV infection, is required to target and measure the impact of interventions. Our analysis was designed to incorporate multiple relevant data sources and estimate HCV burden for the San Francisco population as a whole, including specific key populations at higher risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Our estimates are based on triangulation of data found in case registries, medical records, observational studies, and published literature from 2010 through 2017. We examined subpopulations based on sex, age and/or HCV risk group. When multiple sources of data were available for subpopulation estimates, we calculated a weighted average using inverse variance weighting. Credible ranges (CRs) were derived from 95% confidence intervals of population size and prevalence estimates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We estimate that 21,758 residents of San Francisco are HCV seropositive (CR: 10,274–42,067), representing an overall seroprevalence of 2.5% (CR: 1.2%– 4.9%). Of these, 16,408 are estimated to be viremic (CR: 6,505–37,407), though this estimate includes treated cases; up to 12,257 of these (CR: 2,354–33,256) are people who are untreated and infectious.

Raymond, on behalf of End Hep C SF &lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Initiated in 2016, &lt;i&gt;End Hep C SF&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive initiative to eliminate hepatitis C (HCV) infection in San Francisco. The introduction of direct-acting antivirals to treat and cure HCV provides an opportunity for elimination. To properly measure progress, an estimate of baseline HCV prevalence, and of the number of people in various subpopulations with active HCV infection, is required to target and measure the impact of interventions. Our analysis was designed to incorporate multiple relevant data sources and estimate HCV burden for the San Francisco population as a whole, including specific key populations at higher risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Our estimates are based on triangulation of data found in case registries, medical records, observational studies, and published literature from 2010 through 2017. We examined subpopulations based on sex, age and/or HCV risk group. When multiple sources of data were available for subpopulation estimates, we calculated a weighted average using inverse variance weighting. Credible ranges (CRs) were derived from 95% confidence intervals of population size and prevalence estimates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We estimate that 21,758 residents of San Francisco are HCV seropositive (CR: 10,274–42,067), representing an overall seroprevalence of 2.5% (CR: 1.2%– 4.9%). Of these, 16,408 are estimated to be viremic (CR: 6,505–37,407), though this estimate includes treated cases; up to 12,257 of these (CR: 2,354–33,256) are people who are untreated and infectious. People who injected drugs in the last year represent 67.9% of viremic HCV infections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We estimated approximately 7,400 (51%) more HCV seropositive cases than are included in San Francisco’s HCV surveillance case registry. Our estimate provides a useful baseline against which the impact of &lt;i&gt;End Hep C SF&lt;/i&gt; can be measured.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>26</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195575</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled></item><item><content><content>Mutations in the BEST1 gene cause detachment of the retina and degeneration of photoreceptor (PR) cells due to a primary channelopathy in the neighboring retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to examine whether mothers’ musical background has an effect on their own and their children’s sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA). The aim was also to assess children’s and their mothers’ exercise adherence when using movement-to-music video program.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Sub-group analysis of an intervention group in a randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN33885819).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Seventy-one mother-child-pairs were divided into two categories based on mothers’ musical background. Each pair performed 8 weeks exercise intervention using movement-to-music video program. SB and PA were assessed objectively by accelerometer, and exercise activity, fidelity, and enjoyment were assessed via exercise diaries and questionnaires. Logistic regression model was used to analyze associations in the main outcomes between the groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Those children whose mothers had musical background (MB) had greater probability to increase their light PA during the intervention, but not moderate-to-vigorous PA compared to those children whose mothers did not have musical background (NMB). SB increased in both groups. Mothers in the NMB group had greater probability to increase their light and moderate-to-vigorous PA and decrease their SB than mothers in the MB group. However, exercise adherence decreased considerably in all groups. Completeness, fidelity, and enjoyment were higher among the NMB group compared to the MB group.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The present results showed that mothers without musical background were more interested in movement-to-music exercises, as well as their children. For further studies it would be important to evaluate an effect of children’s own music-based activities on their SB and PA.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The effects of mothers’ musical background on sedentary behavior, physical activity, and exercise adherence in their 5-6-years-old children using movement-to-music video program</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195837</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195837</originId><fingerprint>b0cb7b93</fingerprint><author><name>Pipsa P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides. While these effects have been demonstrated for some substances (e.g. cocaine), current available data for others are more controversial (e.g. cannabis) or very limited (e.g. ecstasy).&lt;/p&gt; Aims of the study &lt;p&gt;To collect data on the type and frequency of psychoactive substance use in cases of emergency department (ED) presentations related to interpersonal violence.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, between May 2012 and June 2016. The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence. Because of the high prevalence of alcohol co-use, no final conclusions can be drawn on the contribution of single substances.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Psychoactive substances and violent offences: A retrospective analysis of presentations to an urban emergency department in Switzerland</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195234</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195234</originId><fingerprint>5ada0717</fingerprint><author><name>Evangelia Liakoni</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195234</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522357200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde2d:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Evangelia Liakoni, Fabienne Gartwyl, Meret Ricklin, Aristomenis K.

Avian Colibacillosis is among the major causes of economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide, with a more vivid impact on developing countries. The involvement of several bacteria has made it challenging to develop effective vaccines for this disease, particularly because it is notoriously difficult to make a vaccine that contains all the contributing pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report the design and fabrication of a bacterial ghost (BG) of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80, which is among the major bacterial serotypes responsible for this disease. The generated ghost is then exploited as a homologous vaccine against Avian Colibacillosis. We demonstrate that hole formation in the cell wall of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80 can happen properly in optical densities as high as 0.8 compared to the 0.3–0.4 standard for bacteria like &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10. This is especially advantageous for mass production of this ghost which is a vital factor in development of any BG-based vaccine. Compared to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10, we faced a great challenge in transforming the wild type bacteria with the E-lysis plasmid which was probably due to higher thickness of the cell wall in O78:K80. This, however, was addressed by treating the cell wall with a different combination of ions.The vaccine was administered to Ross 308 broiler chickens via injection as well as through their respiratory system at a dose of 1010 BGs, repeated 3 times at weekly intervals. Chickens were then challenged with the wild type O78:K80 at a dose of 1011 bacteria together with Infectious Bronchitis H120 vaccine (as immunosuppressant) one week after the last immunization. Air sac lesions were significantly reduced in BG vaccinated groups in comparison with the control group. The levels of IFN&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, IgA and IgY were measured in the serum of immunized chickens as an indication of immune response and were compared with those of the chickens vaccinated with killed bacteria. The results show that O78:K80 BG can be used as an efficient homologous vaccine against Colibacillosis disease in poultry. We expect our findings can serve as the starting point for designing more sophisticated vaccines that contain all three major pathogenic bacteria involved in avian Colibacillosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Bacterial ghost of avian pathogenic &amp;lt;i&gt;E&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; (APEC) serotype O78:K80 as a homologous vaccine against avian colibacillosis</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194888</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194888</originId><fingerprint>a6baea31</fingerprint><author><name>Hakimeh Ebrahimi-Nik</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194888</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1521752400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34bf:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hakimeh Ebrahimi-Nik, Mohammad Reza Bassami, Mehrdad Mohri, Mehrnaz Rad, Mazhar I.

Proneural genes are among the most early-acting genes in nervous system development, instructing blast cells to commit to a neuronal fate. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Atonal and Achaete-Scute complex (AS-C) genes, as well as their vertebrate orthologs, are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with such proneural activity. We show here that a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; AS-C homolog, &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt;, functions in a fundamentally different manner. In the embryonic, larval, and adult nervous systems, &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is expressed exclusively in a single nociceptive neuron class, ADL, and its expression in ADL is maintained via transcriptional autoregulation throughout the life of the animal. However, in &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; null mutants, the ADL neuron is generated and still appears neuronal in overall morphology and expression of panneuronal and pansensory features. Rather than acting as a proneural gene, we find that &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is required for the ADL neuron to function properly, to adopt its correct morphology, to express its unusually large repertoire of olfactory receptor–encoding genes, and to express other known features of terminal ADL identity, including neurotransmitter phenotype, neuropeptides, ion channels, and electrical synapse proteins. &lt;i&gt;hlh-4&lt;/i&gt; is sufficient to induce ADL identity features upon ectopic expression in other neuron types. The expression of ADL terminal identity features is directly controlled by HLH-4 via a phylogenetically conserved E-box motif, which, through bioinformatic analysis, we find to constitute a predictive feature of ADL-expressed terminal identity markers. The lineage that produces the ADL neuron was previously shown to require the conventional, transient proneural activity of another AS-C homolog, &lt;i&gt;hlh-14&lt;/i&gt;, demonstrating sequential activities of distinct AS-C-type bHLH genes in neuronal specification. Taken together, we have defined here an unconventional function of an AS-C-type bHLH gene as a terminal selector of neuronal identity and we speculate that such function could be reflective of an ancestral function of an “ur-” bHLH gene.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kaDsHczXIbg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Unconventional function of an Achaete-Scute homolog as a terminal selector of nociceptive neuron identity</title><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004979</link><recrawled>1524160386781</recrawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004979</originId><fingerprint>f17d1f60</fingerprint><author><name>Neda Masoudi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/kaDsHczXIbg/article</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1524171600000</published><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162df0925ef:4f0a0:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neda Masoudi, Saeed Tavazoie, Lori Glenwinkel, Leesun Ryu, Kyuhyung Kim, Oliver Hobert&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives and methods &lt;p&gt;Using a randomized, crossover, counterbalanced approach, cyclists (N = 20, overnight fasted state) engaged in the four 75-km time trials (2-week washout) while ingesting two types of bananas with similar carbohydrate (CHO) but different phenolic content (Cavendish, CAV; mini-yellow, MIY, 63% higher polyphenols), a 6% sugar beverage (SUG), and water only (WAT). CHO intake was set at 0.2 g/kg every 15 minutes. Blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 0 h-, 0.75 h-,1.5 h-, 3 h-, 4.5 h-, 21 h-, 45 h-post-exercise.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Each of the CHO trials (CAV, MIY, SUG) compared to water was associated with higher post-exercise plasma glucose and fructose, and lower leukocyte counts, plasma 9+13 HODES, and IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra. OPLS-DA analysis showed that metabolic perturbation (N = 1,605 metabolites) for WAT (86.8±4.0 arbitrary units) was significantly greater and sustained than for CAV (70.4±3.9, P = 0.006), MIY (68.3±4.0, P = 0.002), and SUG (68.1±4.2, P = 0.002). VIP ranking (&amp;lt;3.0, N = 25 metabolites) showed that both CAV and MIY were associated with significant fold changes in metabolites including those from amino acid and xenobiotics pathways. OPLS-DA analysis of immediate post-exercise metabolite shifts showed a significant separation of CAV and MIY from both WAT and SUG (R2Y = 0.848, Q2Y = 0.409). COX-2 mRNA expression was lower in both CAV and MIY, but not SUG, versus WAT at 21-h post-exercise in THP-1 monocytes cultured in plasma samples. Analysis of immediate post-exercise samples showed a decrease in LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocyte extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in CAV and MIY, but not SUG, compared to WAT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CHO ingestion from bananas or a sugar beverage had a comparable influence in attenuating metabolic perturbation and inflammation following 75-km cycling. Ex-vivo analysis with THP-1 monocytes supported a decrease in COX-2 mRNA expression and reduced reliance on glycolysis for ATP production following ingestion of bananas but not sugar water when compared to water alone.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov, U.S. National Institutes of Health, identifier: NCT02994628&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Metabolic recovery from heavy exertion following banana compared to sugar beverage or water only ingestion: A randomized, crossover trial</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194843</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194843</originId><fingerprint>f22a8a91</fingerprint><author><name>David C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Agreed international development standards underpin high quality &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There is however, no international consensus on how high quality CPGs should ‘look’; or on whether high quality CPGs from one country can be viably implemented elsewhere.

Offspring survival is generally more variable than adult survival and may limit population growth. Although white-tailed deer neonate survival has been intensively investigated, recent work has emphasized how specific cover types influence neonate survival at local scales (single study area). These localized investigations have often led to inconsistences within the literature. Developing specific hypotheses describing the relationships among environmental, habitat, and landscape factors influencing white-tailed deer neonate survival at regional scales may allow for detection of generalized patterns. Therefore, we developed 11 hypotheses representing the various effects of environmental (e.g., winter and spring weather), habitat (e.g., hiding and escape cover types), and landscape factors (e.g., landscape configuration regardless of specific cover type available) on white-tailed deer neonate survival up to one-month and from one- to three-months of age. At one-month, surviving fawns experienced a warmer lowest recorded June temperature and more June precipitation than those that perished. At three-months, patch connectance (percent of patches of the corresponding patch type that are connected within a predefined distance) positively influenced survival. Our results are consistent with white-tailed deer neonate ecology: increased spring temperature and precipitation are likely associated with a flush of nutritional resources available to the mother, promoting increased lactation efficiency and neonate growth early in life. In contrast, reduced spring temperature with increased precipitation place neonates at risk to hypothermia. Increased patch connectance likely reflects increased escape cover available within a neonate’s home range after they are able to flee from predators. If suitable escape cover is available on the landscape, then managers could focus efforts towards manipulating landscape configuration (patch connectance) to promote increased neonate survival while monitoring spring weather to assess potential influences on current year survival.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Weather and landscape factors affect white-tailed deer neonate survival at ecologically important life stages in the Northern Great Plains</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195247</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195247</originId><fingerprint>2ecedc0e</fingerprint><author><name>Eric S.

Our data causally elucidate the cellular origin of the long-range coupling in the developing brain.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1523318400000</published><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162ae61b08c:1b6029e:7c9981b6</id><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33158</link><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33158</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523344060556</crawled></item><item><title>[ASAP] Computational Modeling of Exciton-Bath Hamiltonians for Light Harvesting 2 and Light Harvesting 3 Complexes of Purple Photosynthetic Bacteria at Room Temperature</title><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00358/20180330/images/medium/jp-2018-00358h_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00358&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Body Mass Index (BMI), like most human phenotypes, is substantially heritable. However, BMI is not normally distributed; the skew appears to be structural, and increases as a function of age. Moreover, twin correlations for BMI commonly violate the assumptions of the most common variety of the classical twin model, with the MZ twin correlation greater than twice the DZ correlation. This study aimed to decompose twin correlations for BMI using more general skew-t distributions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Same sex MZ and DZ twin pairs (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 7,086) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry were included. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to decompose twin correlations for BMI into multiple mixture distributions. LPA was performed using the default normal mixture distribution and the skew-t mixture distribution. Similar analyses were performed for height as a comparison. Our analyses are then replicated in an independent dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A two-class solution under the skew-t mixture distribution fits the BMI distribution for both genders. The first class consists of a relatively normally distributed, highly heritable BMI with a mean in the normal range. The second class is a positively skewed BMI in the overweight and obese range, with lower twin correlations. In contrast, height is normally distributed, highly heritable, and is well-fit by a single latent class. Results in the replication dataset were highly similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that two distinct processes underlie the skew of the BMI distribution.

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect.

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection. NHBA cleavage may occur at different stages of the infection, and it likely has a different role depending on the environment the bacterium is interacting with.</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194662</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Deborah A.

We aimed to determine the effects of levodopa medication on the performance of a repetitive pointing task while standing, and to investigate the optimal trial duration in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, and older adults. Seventeen individuals with Parkinson’s disease (5 freezers) and 9 older adults stood on force platforms for 30 s and 120 s while performing a bilateral repetitive pointing task, tracked by motion capture. Participants with Parkinson’s disease were assessed on and off medication and older adults were also assessed on separate days. The main findings were that: 1) on medication, participants with Parkinson’s exhibited greater center of pressure root mean square in the medial-lateral direction, greater velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions, and greater range in the medial-lateral direction than off medication; 2) longer trial durations resulted in greater center of pressure range in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and greater coefficient of variation in finger pointing on the least affected side; 3) Parkinson’s participants exhibited larger range in the medial-lateral direction compared to older adults; 4) off medication, freezers presented with less range and root mean square in the anterior-posterior direction than non-freezers; and 5) a correlation emerged between the freezing of gait questionnaire and pointing asymmetry and the coefficient of variation of pointing on the most affected side. Therefore, Parkinson’s medication may increase instability during a repetitive pointing task. Longer trials may provide a better depiction of sway by discriminating between those with and without neurological impairment. Individuals with Parkinson’s were less stable than older adults, supporting that they are at a greater risk for falls. The greater restrictive postural strategy in freezers compared to non-freezers is likely a factor that augments fall-risk. Lastly, the link between freezing of gait and upper-limb movement indicates that freezing may manifest first in the lower-limbs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Medication and trial duration influence postural and pointing parameters during a standing repetitive pointing task in individuals with Parkinson’s disease</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</originId><fingerprint>15afb55e</fingerprint><author><name>Deborah A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. Controversies still exist over the relationship between hyponatremia and outcomes of hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To analyze the association of low serum sodium levels at hospital admission with in-hospital mortality and patient disposition and to compare the distribution of the risk of death associated with hyponatremia across the lifespan of hospitalized patients, we conducted an observational study of 2.3 million patients using data extracted from the Cerner Health Facts database between 2000 and 2014. Logistic regression models were used in the analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At hospital admission 14.4% of hospitalized patients had serum sodium levels [Na] &amp;lt;135 mEq/L. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, we found that the risk of in-hospital mortality significantly increases for [Na] levels &amp;lt; 135 or ≥143 to ≤145 mEq/L compared to the reference interval of 140 to &amp;lt;143 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001). We observed similar trends for the relationship between [Na] levels and discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility. We demonstrated that younger age groups (18 to &amp;lt;45, 45 to &amp;lt;65) had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to older age groups (65 to &amp;lt;75, ≥75) for [Na] levels &amp;lt;130 mEq/L or 143 to ≤145 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is common among hospitalized patients and is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility.

Skeletal muscle function is highly dependent on the ability to regenerate, however, during ageing or disease, the proliferative capacity is reduced, leading to loss of muscle function. We have previously demonstrated the presence of vitamin K2 in bovine skeletal muscles, but whether vitamin K has a role in muscle regulation and function is unknown. In this study, we used primary bovine skeletal muscle cells, cultured in monolayers &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, to assess a potential effect of vitamin K2 (MK-4) during myogenesis of muscle cells. Cell viability experiments demonstrate that the amount of ATP produced by the cells was unchanged when MK-4 was added, indicating viable cells. Cytotoxicity analysis show that MK-4 reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the media, suggesting that MK-4 was beneficial to the muscle cells. Cell migration, proliferation and differentiation was characterised after MK-4 incubation using wound scratch analysis, immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR analysis. Adding MK-4 to the cells led to an increased muscle proliferation, increased gene expression of the myogenic transcription factor &lt;i&gt;myod&lt;/i&gt; as well as increased cell migration. In addition, we observed a reduction in the fusion index and relative gene expression of muscle differentiation markers, with fewer complex myotubes formed in MK-4 stimulated cells compared to control cells, indicating that the MK-4 plays a significant role during the early phases of muscle proliferation. Likewise, we see the same pattern for the relative gene expression of collagen 1A, showing increased gene expression in proliferating cells, and reduced expression in differentiating cells. Our results also suggest that MK-4 incubation affect low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) with a peak in gene expression after 45 min of MK-4 incubation. Altogether, our experiments show that MK-4 has a positive effect on muscle cell migration and proliferation, which are two important steps during early myogenesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Vitamin K2 improves proliferation and migration of bovine skeletal muscle cells &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195432</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195432</originId><fingerprint>27a51842</fingerprint><author><name>Sissel Beate Rønning</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195432</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522875600000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57605:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sissel Beate Rønning, Mona Elisabeth Pedersen, Ragnhild Stenberg Berg, Bente Kirkhus, Rune Rødbotten&lt;/p&gt;

Antithyroid drugs are generally selected as the first-line treatment for Graves’ Disease (GD); however, the existence of patients showing resistance or severe side effects to these drugs is an important issue to be solved. The (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] is a multi-functional protein that activates the tissue renin-angiotensin system and is an essential constituent of vacuolar H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase, necessary for the autophagy-lysosome pathway. (P)RR is cleaved to soluble (s)(P)RR, which reflects the status of (P)RR expression. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate whether serum s(P)RR concentration can be used as a biomarker to predict the outcome of antithyroid drug treatment in GD patients. Serum s(P)RR levels were measured in 54 untreated GD patients and 47 control participants. Effects of medical treatment with antithyroid drugs on these levels were investigated in GD patients. Serum s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in patients with Graves’ disease than in control subjects (P&amp;lt;0.005) and were significantly reduced after medical treatment for Graves’ disease. High serum s(P)RR levels were associated with resistance to antithyroid drug treatment, suggesting that serum s(P)RR concentration can be used as a useful biomarker to predict the outcome of antithyroid drug treatment in these patients. Patients with Graves’ disease with low body mass index showed higher levels of serum soluble (pro)renin receptor levels than those with high body mass index. In addition, in patients with Graves’ disease, serum triglyceride levels were negatively correlated with serum soluble (pro)renin receptor levels. All these data indicated an association between low nutrient condition due to hyperthyroidism and increased (pro)renin receptor expression in these patients, suggesting that (pro)renin receptor expression could be increased in the process of stimulating intracellular energy production via activating autophagy function to compensate energy loss.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Prediction of response to medical therapy by serum soluble (pro)renin receptor levels in Graves’ disease</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195464</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195464</originId><fingerprint>59d0f88f</fingerprint><author><name>Yuki Mizuguchi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195464</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522962000000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d734:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Mizuguchi, Satoshi Morimoto, Shihori Kimura, Noriyoshi Takano, Kaoru Yamashita, Yasufumi Seki, Kanako Bokuda, Midori Yatabe, Junichi Yatabe, Daisuke Watanabe, Takashi Ando, Atsuhiro Ichihara&lt;/p&gt;

Mosquitoes function as important vectors for many diseases globally and can have substantial negative economic, environmental, and health impacts. Specifically, West Nile virus (WNv) is a significant and increasing threat to wildlife populations and human health throughout North America. Mosquito control is an important means of controlling the spread of WNv, as the virus is primarily spread between avian and mosquito vectors. This is of particular concern for avian host species such as the Greater sage-grouse (&lt;i&gt;Centrocercus urophasianus&lt;/i&gt;), in which WNv negatively impacts fitness parameters. Most mosquito control methods focus on the larval stages. In North America, control efforts are largely limited to larvicides, which require repeated application and have potentially negative ecological impacts. There are multiple potential advantages to using indigenous fish species as an alternative for larval control including lowered environmental impact, decreased costs in terms of time and financial inputs, and the potential for the establishment of self-sustaining fish populations. We tested the efficacy of using fathead minnows (&lt;i&gt;Pimephales promelas&lt;/i&gt;) as biological control for mosquito populations in livestock reservoirs of semiarid rangelands. We introduced minnows into 10 treatment reservoirs and monitored an additional 6 non-treated reservoirs as controls over 3 years. Adult mosquitoes of species known to transmit WNv (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Culex tarsalis&lt;/i&gt;) were captured at each site and mosquito larvae were also present at all sites. Stable isotope analysis confirmed that introduced fathead minnows were feeding at the mosquito larvae trophic level in all but one treatment pond. Treatment ponds demonstrated suppressed levels of mosquito larva over each season compared to controls with a model-predicted 114% decrease in larva density within treatment ponds. Minnows established self-sustaining populations throughout the study in all reservoirs that maintained sufficient water levels. Minnow survival was not influenced by water quality. Though minnows did not completely eradicate mosquito larvae, minnows are a promising alternative to controlling mosquito larvae density within reservoirs. We caution that careful site selection is critical to avoid potential negative impacts, but suggest the introduction of fathead minnows in reservoirs can dramatically reduce mosquito larva abundance and potentially help mitigate vector-borne disease transmission.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Assessing the efficacy of fathead minnows (&amp;lt;i&gt;Pimephales promelas&amp;lt;/i&gt;) for mosquito control</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194304</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194304</originId><fingerprint>7538efc3</fingerprint><author><name>Ryan T.

Identifying effective antivirals for treating Ebola virus disease (EVD) and minimizing transmission of such disease is critical. A variety of cell-based assays have been developed for evaluating compounds for activity against Ebola virus. However, very few reports discuss the variable assay conditions that can affect the results obtained from these drug screens. Here, we describe variable conditions tested during the development of our cell-based drug screen assays designed to identify compounds with anti-Ebola virus activity using established cell lines and human primary cells. The effect of multiple assay readouts and variable assay conditions, including virus input, time of infection, and the cell passage number, were compared, and the impact on the effective concentration for 50% and/ or 90% inhibition (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, EC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;) was evaluated using the FDA-approved compound, toremifene citrate. In these studies, we show that altering cell-based assay conditions can have an impact on apparent drug potency as measured by the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;.

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hb&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA or protein. Instead, we find that Pum and Nos control the accumulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in testes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>No significant regulation of &amp;lt;i&gt;bicoid&amp;lt;/i&gt; mRNA by Pumilio or Nanos in the early &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt; embryo</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194865</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194865</originId><fingerprint>cd12af8a</fingerprint><author><name>Tammy H.

However, the process through which IDE recognizes peptides that tend to form amyloid fibrils remained unsolved. We used cryoEM to understand both the apo- and insulin-bound dimeric IDE states, revealing that IDE displays a large opening between the homologous ~55 kDa N- and C-terminal halves to allow selective substrate capture based on size and charge complementarity. We also used cryoEM, X-ray crystallography, SAXS, and HDX-MS to elucidate the molecular basis of how amyloidogenic peptides stabilize the disordered IDE catalytic cleft, thereby inducing selective degradation by substrate-assisted catalysis. Furthermore, our insulin-bound IDE structures explain how IDE processively degrades insulin by stochastically cutting either chain without breaking disulfide bonds.

However, the process through which IDE recognizes peptides that tend to form amyloid fibrils remained unsolved. We used cryoEM to understand both the apo- and insulin-bound dimeric IDE states, revealing that IDE displays a large opening between the homologous ~55 kDa N- and C-terminal halves to allow selective substrate capture based on size and charge complementarity. We also used cryoEM, X-ray crystallography, SAXS, and HDX-MS to elucidate the molecular basis of how amyloidogenic peptides stabilize the disordered IDE catalytic cleft, thereby inducing selective degradation by substrate-assisted catalysis. Furthermore, our insulin-bound IDE structures explain how IDE processively degrades insulin by stochastically cutting either chain without breaking disulfide bonds.

microwave conjugation results in a polymerized iron-phthalocyanine (pFePc) which
exhibits extremely high ORR performance,, showing
activity much better than that of the FePc monomer and 20 wt % Pt/C, and similar
to that of the 60 wt % Pt/C under the same catalyst loading. Furthermore, we proposed an edge-closing strategy to significantly
enhance the stability of the pFePc
catalyst in alkaline media by eliminating the edge anhydride groups. Using the edge-closed pFePc as cathode catalyst in APFC,
a power density as high as 452 mW∙cm-2 is achieved, which is among
the best performance of non-noble metal catalyst-based APFCs so far reported.</description><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Boosting_the_Performance_of_Iron-Phthalocyanine_as_Cathode_Electrocatalyst_for_Alkaline_Polymer_Fuel_Cells_Through_Edge-Closed_Conjugation/6152435</originId><fingerprint>4c3924a5</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Boosting_the_Performance_of_Iron-Phthalocyanine_as_Cathode_Electrocatalyst_for_Alkaline_Polymer_Fuel_Cells_Through_Edge-Closed_Conjugation/6152435</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><content>One-pot

In this paper we explored the effects of exposure to images of the suffering and vulnerability of others on altruistic, trust-based, and reciprocated incentivized economic decisions, accounting for differences in participants’ dispositional empathy and reported in-group trust for their recipient(s). This was done using a pictorial priming task, framed as a memory test, and a triadic economic game design. Using the largest experimental sample to date to explore this issue, our integrated analysis of two online experiments (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 519), found statistically consistent evidence that exposure to images of suffering and vulnerability (vs. neutral images) increased altruistic in-group giving as measured by the “triple dictator game”, and that the manipulation was significantly more effective in those who reported lower trust for their recipients. The experimental manipulation also significantly increased altruistic giving in the standard “dictator game” and trust-based giving in the “investment game”, but only in those who were lower in in-group trust and also high in affective or cognitive empathy. Complementary qualitative evidence revealed the strongest motivations associated with increased giving in the experimental condition were greater assumed reciprocation and a lower aversion to risk. However, no consistent effects of the experimental manipulation on participants’ reciprocated decisions were observed. These findings suggest that, as well as altruistic decision-making in the “triple dictator game”, collaboratively witnessing the suffering of others may heighten trust-based in-group giving in the “investment game” for some people, but the effects are heterogeneous and sensitive to context.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>The effects of exposure to images of others&apos; suffering and vulnerability on altruistic, trust-based, and reciprocated economic decision-making</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194569</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194569</originId><fingerprint>543cc4d1</fingerprint><author><name>Philip A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing breastfeeding rates have been associated with reductions in disease in babies and mothers as well as in related costs. ‘Nourishing Start for Health (NoSH)’, a financial incentive scheme has been proposed as a potentially effective way to increase both the number of mothers breastfeeding and duration of breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt; Aims &lt;p&gt;To establish women’s relative preferences for different aspects of a financial incentive scheme for breastfeeding and to identify importance of scheme characteristics on probability on participation in an incentive scheme.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A discrete choice experiment (DCE) obtained information on alternative specifications of the NoSH scheme designed to promote continued breastfeeding duration until at least 6 weeks after birth. Four attributes framed alternative scheme designs: value of the incentive; minimum breastfeeding duration required to receive incentive; method of verifying breastfeeding; type of incentive. Three versions of the DCE questionnaire, each containing 8 different choice sets, provided 24 choice sets for analysis. The questionnaire was mailed to 2,531 women in the South Yorkshire Cohort (SYC) aged 16–45 years in IMD quintiles 3–5. The analytic approach considered conditional and mixed effects logistic models to account for preference heterogeneity that may be associated with a variation in effects mediated by respondents’ characteristics.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;564 women completed the questionnaire and a response rate of 22% was achieved. Most of the included attributes were found to affect utility and therefore the probability to participate in the incentive scheme. Higher rewards were preferred, although the type of incentive significantly affected women’s preferences on average. We found evidence for preference heterogeneity based on individual characteristics that mediated preferences for an incentive scheme.ConclusionsAlthough participants’ opinion in our sample was mixed, financial incentives for breastfeeding may be an acceptable and effective instrument to change behaviour. However, individual characteristics could mediate the effect and should therefore be considered when developing and targeting future interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Women’s preferences for alternative financial incentive schemes for breastfeeding: A discrete choice experiment</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194231</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194231</originId><fingerprint>83736884</fingerprint><author><name>Frauke Becker</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194231</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523566800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7126:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frauke Becker, Nana Anokye, Esther W. de Bekker-Grob, Ailish Higgins, Clare Relton, Mark Strong, Julia Fox-Rushby&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the included attributes were found to affect utility and therefore the probability to participate in the incentive scheme. Higher rewards were preferred, although the type of incentive significantly affected women’s preferences on average. We found evidence for preference heterogeneity based on individual characteristics that mediated preferences for an incentive scheme.ConclusionsAlthough participants’ opinion in our sample was mixed, financial incentives for breastfeeding may be an acceptable and effective instrument to change behaviour. However, individual characteristics could mediate the effect and should therefore be considered when developing and targeting future interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194231</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How early Britons weathered two climate calamities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How early Britons weathered two climate calamities, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03894-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03894-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A brutal cold was too much for some hunter-gatherers — but not the people of Star Carr.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>How early Britons weathered two climate calamities</title><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How early Britons weathered two climate calamities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How early Britons weathered two climate calamities, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03894-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03894-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A brutal cold was too much for some hunter-gatherers — but not the people of Star Carr.</description><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03894-y</originId><fingerprint>6eae8a56</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03894-y</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522047600000</published><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162645acaa2:5decbd9:9f3b30f2</id><engagement>4</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03894-y</link><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03894-y/d41586-018-03894-y_15559576.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1522102094498</crawled></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Adaptive enhanced sampling by force-biasing using neural networks</title><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020733?af=R</originId><fingerprint>c962c722</fingerprint><author><name>Ashley Z.

Commercial hunting for the international trade in animal hides in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century decimated many populations of aquatic wildlife in Amazonia. However, impacts varied significantly between different species and regions, depending upon hunting intensity, accessibility of habitat, and the inherent resilience of various species and their habitats. We investigated the differential responses of two Amazonian Mustelid species, the neotropical otter and giant otter, to commercial hunting pressure along the upper Rio Negro in Brazil, and examined historical factors that influenced spatial and temporal variation in commercial exploitation. We analyzed previously unanalyzed data from historical records of hide shipments to track changes in hide sales and prices for the two species in the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. We also gathered oral histories from older Baniwa people who had witnessed or participated in commercial otter hunting. These complimentary data sources reveal how intrinsic biological and social characteristics of the two otter species interacted with market forces and regional history. Whereas giant otter populations were driven to local or regional extinction during the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century by commercial hunting, neotropical otters persisted. In recent decades, giant otter populations have returned to some parts of the upper Rio Negro, a development which local people welcome as part of a generalized recovery of the ecosystems in their territory as a result of the banning of animal pelt exports and indigenous land demarcation. This paper expands the scope of the field historical ecology and reflects on the role of local knowledge in biodiversity conservation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Differential resilience of Amazonian otters along the Rio Negro in the aftermath of the 20&amp;lt;sup&gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&gt; century international fur trade</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193984</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193984</originId><fingerprint>29f67cee</fingerprint><author><name>Natalia C.

α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies found in synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Under the pathological conditions, α-syn tends to generate a diverse form of aggregates showing toxicity to neuronal cells and able to transmit across cells. However, mechanisms by which α-syn aggregates affect cytotoxicity in neurons have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that α-syn aggregates preferentially sequester specific synaptic proteins such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) through direct binding which is resistant to SDS. The sequestration effect of α-syn aggregates was shown in a cell-free system, cultured primary neurons, and PD mouse model. Furthermore, we identified a specific blocking peptide derived from VAMP2 which partially inhibited the sequestration by α-syn aggregates and contributed to reduced neurotoxicity. These results provide a mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by α-syn aggregates and suggest that the blocking peptide interfering with the pathological role of α-syn aggregates could be useful for designing a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of PD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Sequestration of synaptic proteins by alpha-synuclein aggregates leading to neurotoxicity is inhibited by small peptide</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195339</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195339</originId><fingerprint>55727e5b</fingerprint><author><name>Mal-Gi Choi</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195339</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522702800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76935:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mal-Gi Choi, Mi Jin Kim, Do-Geun Kim, Ri Yu, You-Na Jang, Won-Jong Oh&lt;/p&gt;

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be overcome by electrical stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) via a cochlear implant (CI). Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between the SGNs and the electrode, but the efficacy of CI is also limited by the degeneration of SGNs as one consequence of SHNL. In the healthy cochlea, the survival of SGNs is assured by endogenous neurotrophic support. Several applications of exogenous neurotrophic supply have been shown to reduce SGN degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the present study, nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs), with an approximate diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, were loaded with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to test their efficacy as long-term delivery system for neurotrophins. The neurotrophic factor was released constantly from the NPSNPs over a release period of 80 days when the surface of the nanoparticles had been modified with amino groups.

Importantly, also the amounts of BDNF released up to a time period of 39 days increased the survival rate of SGNs. Thus, NPSNPs carrying BDNF are suitable for the treatment of inner ear disease and for the protection and the support of SGNs. Their nanoscale nature and the fact that a direct contact of the nanoparticles and the SGNs is not necessary for neuroprotective effects, should allow for the facile preparation of nanocomposites, e.g., with biocompatible polymers, to install coatings on implants for the realization of implant-based growth factor delivery systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Long-term delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from nanoporous silica nanoparticles improves the survival of spiral ganglion neurons in vitro</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194778</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194778</originId><fingerprint>8ab24b99</fingerprint><author><name>Nadeschda Schmidt</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194778</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522184400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f0a:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadeschda Schmidt, Jennifer Schulze, Dawid P.

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be overcome by electrical stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) via a cochlear implant (CI). Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between the SGNs and the electrode, but the efficacy of CI is also limited by the degeneration of SGNs as one consequence of SHNL. In the healthy cochlea, the survival of SGNs is assured by endogenous neurotrophic support. Several applications of exogenous neurotrophic supply have been shown to reduce SGN degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the present study, nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs), with an approximate diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, were loaded with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to test their efficacy as long-term delivery system for neurotrophins. The neurotrophic factor was released constantly from the NPSNPs over a release period of 80 days when the surface of the nanoparticles had been modified with amino groups.

Childhood traumas, in the form of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect, are globally widespread and highly prevalent, and associated with a range of subsequent poor health outcomes. This study sought to understand the relationship between physical, sexual and emotional childhood abuse and subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people (18–30) living in urban informal settlements in Durban, South Africa. Data came from self-completed questionnaires amongst 680 women and 677 men comprising the baseline of the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention trial. Men and women were analysed separately. Logistic regression models assessed the relationship between six HIV-risk behaviours and four measures of trauma: the form of trauma, the severity of each trauma, the range of traumas, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Childhood traumas were incredibly prevalent in this population. All childhood traumas were associated with a range of HIV-risk behaviours. This was for the ever/never trauma, as well as the severity of each type of trauma, the range of trauma, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Despite the wider harsh contexts of urban informal settlements, childhood traumas still play a significant role in shaping subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people. Interventions to reduce childhood traumas for populations in informal settlements need to be developed. In addition, trauma focused therapies need to be considered as part of wider HIV-prevention interventions for young adults.

A suitable irrigation method adopted to arid desert conditions, including a special soil structure and specialized plants, has been continuously studied and improved. A field study was conducted in the Awei irrigation area of Aletai in Xinjiang in 2015 and 2016 to investigate the applicability of shallow subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) in an arid desert area. A completely randomized block design with three replications and three treatments for drip tape subsurface depths at 5, 10, 20 cm was established. The results indicated that the vertical distribution of the soil moisture of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI, buried depth at 20 cm) was mainly concentrated at 0–60 cm, while SSDI (buried depth at 5 and 10 cm) was concentrated at 0–30 cm. However, the roots distributions were concentrated at 0–30 cm for SDI and SSDI. The chlorophyll content and water consumption intensity for alfalfa first increased and then decreased in arid desert conditions. The dry yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of SSDI (buried depth at 10 cm) were higher than those of SDI. The SSDI was practical in arid desert conditions and the recommended buried depth was 10 cm.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Adaptability of shallow subsurface drip irrigation of alfalfa in an arid desert area of Northern Xinjiang</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195965</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195965</originId><fingerprint>2af7be7</fingerprint><author><name>Shufang Wang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195965</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523653200000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363b:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shufang Wang, Xiyun Jiao, Weihua Guo, Jian Lu, Yungang Bai, Liping Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Thirteen variants (13/128, 10%) were ultimately classified as pathogenic. Most deaths (63%) occurred during sleep. Gene variant carriage was more likely with a positive medical history (mostly seizures, 63% vs 36%, p = 0.01), amongst females (36% vs 12%, p = 0.001) and whites more than Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Children 1–12 years were more likely to be gene-positive (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Family screening identified 42 gene-positive relatives, 18 with definitive phenotypic expression of LQTS/Brugada. 76% of the variants were maternally inherited (p = 0.007). Further family investigations and research now support pathogenicity of the variant in 13/27 (48%) of gene-positive cases.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, variants in &lt;i&gt;SCN5A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KCNH2&lt;/i&gt;, with maternal inheritance, predominate.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression could be discussed as an adaption that promotes repair and counteracts cell damage. Myoglobin is released upon muscle damage of several pathways. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the expression of HSP70 in kidney, heart and brain and of myoglobin in the kidney were associated with the cause of death and the survival times after lethal intoxications with three of the drugs most widely used in our local area (Saxony, Germany) as well as after fatal traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively collected kidney, heart and brain samples of 50 autopsy cases with toxicological proved lethal intoxication (main drugs methamphetamine, morphine, alcohol), 14 TBI cases and 15 fatalities with acute myocardial injury in age- and gender-matched compilations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our main findings suggest that HSP70 is associated with hyperthermal and other stress factors of most cell populations. HSP70 expressions in kidney and heart muscle are useful for a differentiation between fatal intoxications and cases without toxicological influence (p &amp;lt; 0.05). There were significant differences in the cerebral expression patterns between methamphetamine- and morphine-associated deaths compared to alcohol fatalities (p &amp;lt; 0.05). An intensive staining of HSP70 in the pericontusional zone and the hippocampus after TBI (especially neuronal and vascular) was shown even after short survival times and may be useful as an additional marker in questions of vitality or wound age. A relevant myoglobin decoration of renal tubules was only shown for methamphetamine abuse in the study presented.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In sum, the immunohistochemical characteristics presented can be supportive for determining final death circumstances and minimal trauma survival times but are not isolated usefully for the detection of drug- or trauma-induced hyperthermia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Drug- and/or trauma-induced hyperthermia?

Bacteriophage TP-84 is a well-characterized bacteriophage of historical interest. It is a member of the &lt;i&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/i&gt;, and infects a number of thermophilic &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;stearothermophilus&lt;/i&gt; strains. Its’ 47.7-kbp double-stranded DNA genome revealed the presence of 81 coding sequences (CDSs) coding for polypeptides of 4 kDa or larger. Interestingly, all CDSs are oriented in the same direction, pointing to a dominant transcription direction of one DNA strand. Based on a homology search, a hypothetical function could be assigned to 31 CDSs. No RNA or DNA polymerase-coding genes were found on the bacteriophage genome indicating that TP-84 relies on the host’s transcriptional and replication enzymes. The TP84 genome is tightly packed with CDSs, typically spaced by several-to-tens of bp or often overlapping. The genome contains five putative promoter-like sequences showing similarity to the host promoter consensus sequence and allowing for a 2-bp mismatch. In addition, ten putative rho-independent terminators were detected. Because the genome sequence shows essentially no similarity to any previously characterised bacteriophage, TP-84 should be considered a new species in an undefined genus within the &lt;i&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/i&gt; family. Thus a taxonomic proposal of a new &lt;i&gt;Tp84virus&lt;/i&gt; genus has been accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The bioinformatics genome analysis was verified by confirmation of 33 TP-84 proteins, which included: a) cloning of a selected CDS in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, coding for a DNA single-stranded binding protein (SSB; gene TP84_63), b) purification and functional assays of the recombinant TP-84 SSB, which has been shown to improve PCR reactions, c) mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of TP-84 bacteriophage capsid proteins, d) purification of TP-84 endolysin activity, e) MS analysis of the host cells from infection time course.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Sequence, genome organization, annotation and proteomics of the thermophilic, 47.7-kb &amp;lt;i&gt;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&amp;lt;/i&gt; bacteriophage TP-84 and its classification in the new &amp;lt;i&gt;Tp84virus&amp;lt;/i&gt; genus</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195449</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195449</originId><fingerprint>6006a444</fingerprint><author><name>Piotr M.

The outcome of stroke patients is complex and multidimensional. We evaluated the impact of acute-phase variables, including clinical state, complications, resource use and interventions, on 6-month survival after first-ever stroke, taking into account baseline conditions exerting a possible effect on outcome.
As part of a National Research Program, we performed a prospective observational study of acute stroke patients in four Italian Regions. Consecutive patients admitted for a period of 3 months to the emergency rooms of participating hospitals were included.
A total of 1030 patients were enrolled (median age 76.0 years, 52.1% males). At 6 months, 816 (79.2%) were alive, and 164 (15.9%) deceased. Survival status at the 6-month follow-up was missing for 50 (4.9%). Neurological state in the acute phase was significantly worse in patients deceased at 6 months, who showed also higher frequency of acute-phase complications. Cox regression analysis adjusted for demographics, pre-stroke function, baseline diseases and risk factors, indicated as significant predictors of 6-month death altered consciousness (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.14–2.53), total anterior circulation infarct (HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.44–3.15), hyperthermia (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.18–2.45), pneumonia (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.18–2.61), heart failure (HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.34–6.13) and nasogastric feeding (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.53–3.60), while antiplatelet therapy during acute phase (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39–0.79), and early mobilisation (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36–0.84) significantly increased 6-month survival.
In a prospective observational study, stroke severity and some acute-phase complications, potentially modifiable, significantly increased the risk of 6-month death, independently of baseline variables. Early mobilisation positively affected survival, highlighting the role of early rehabilitation after stroke.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Impact of acute-phase complications and interventions on 6-month survival after stroke.

We report experimental and numerical results on pattern formation of self-organizing &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium discoideum&lt;/i&gt; cells in a microfluidic setup under a constant buffer flow. The external flow advects the signaling molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) downstream, while the chemotactic cells attached to the solid substrate are not transported with the flow. At high flow velocities, elongated cAMP waves are formed that cover the whole length of the channel and propagate both parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction. While the wave period and transverse propagation velocity are constant, parallel wave velocity and the wave width increase linearly with the imposed flow. We also observe that the acquired wave shape is highly dependent on the wave generation site and the strength of the imposed flow. We compared the wave shape and velocity with numerical simulations performed using a reaction-diffusion model and found excellent agreement. These results are expected to play an important role in understanding the process of pattern formation and aggregation of &lt;i&gt;D. discoideum&lt;/i&gt; that may experience fluid flows in its natural habitat.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Influence of fast advective flows on pattern formation of &amp;lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium discoideum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194859</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194859</originId><fingerprint>78135b38</fingerprint><author><name>Torsten Eckstein</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194859</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1522270800000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4242:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Torsten Eckstein, Estefania Vidal-Henriquez, Albert Bae, Vladimir Zykov, Eberhard Bodenschatz, Azam Gholami&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Unstable conditions of the craniocervical junction such as atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) or atlanto-axial instability (AAI) are severe injuries with a high risk of tetraplegia or death. Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown.The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system.In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9° of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement. In case of unstable craniocervical junction, this leads to a dural sac compression and thus to possible damage to the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Motion and dural sac compression in the upper cervical spine during the application of a cervical collar in case of unstable craniocervical junction—A study in two new cadaveric trauma models</title><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195215</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195215</originId><fingerprint>4ad99bdb</fingerprint><author><name>Shiyao Liao</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195215</href></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1523048400000</published><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd06f:7c9981b6</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiyao Liao, Niko R.
