Background &lt;p&gt;A prospective Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program has been implemented in Korea to improve the quality and safety of medication use.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the influence of the DUR program in reducing incidence of preventable adverse drug reactions (pADRs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was performed using administrative data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). The claims data for all adult patients with adverse drug events (ADE)-related diagnoses from 2009 to 2014 were obtained. Incidence rates of first-time and repeat pADRs prior to and after DUR program implementation were evaluated. Quarterly trends in incidence rates of overall ADE, allergic reactions, and ADRs were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data extraction covering the period from 2009 to 2014 led to the identification of 3,927,662 records. First-time pADR rates decreased gradually after implementation of the DUR program (change in slope: -0.016, p = 0.02). The program had a similar influence on repeat pADR rates (change in slope: -0.006, p≤0.01). The program did not decrease rates of first-time or repeat allergic reactions (change in slope: 0.018, p = 0.07 and 0.003, p = 0.04, respectively). In the cohort aged ≤65 years, first-time pADR rate reduction was significant (28.2% [27.1–29.3] in ≤18 years, and 19.8% [18.1–21.5] in 19–64 years). In contrast, first-time pADR rate was increased by 0.6% [-0.7–1.9] in patients ≥65 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Implementation of the prospective DUR program effectively reduced the number of pADRs. In the future, to reduce non-preventable ADRs such as allergic reactions, provision of clinical information including allergy history should be added to the DUR program.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jimin Lee, Yoojin Noh, Sukhyang Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Contraction of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) isolated from pulmonary arterial hypertensive (PAH) and normal (non-PAH) subject lungs was determined and measured with real-time electrical impedance. Treatment of HPASMC with vasoactive peptides, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and bradykinin (BK) but not angiotensin II, induced a temporal decrease in the electrical impedance profile mirroring constrictive morphological change of the cells which typically was more robust in PAH as opposed to non-PAH cells. Inhibition with LIMKi3 and a cofilin targeted motif mimicking cell permeable peptide (MMCPP) had no effect on ET-1 induced HPASMC contraction indicating a negligible role for these actin regulatory proteins. On the other hand, a MMCPP blocking the activity of caldesmon reduced ET-1 promoted contraction pointing to a regulatory role of this protein and its activation pathway in HPASMC contraction. Inhibition of this MEK/ERK/p90RSK pathway, which is an upstream regulator of caldesmon phosphorylation, reduced ET-1 induced cell contraction. While the regulation of ET-1 induced cell contraction was found to be similar in PAH and non-PAH cells, a key difference was the response to pharmacological inhibitors and to siRNA knockdown of Rho kinases (ROCK1/ROCK2). The PAH cells required much higher concentrations of inhibitors to abrogate ET-1 induced contractions and their contraction was not affected by siRNA against either ROCK1 or ROCK2. Lastly, blocking of L-type and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels had no effect on ET-1 or BK induced contraction. However, inhibiting the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase blunted ET-1 and BK induced HPASMC contraction in both PAH and non-PAH derived HPASMC. In summary, our findings here together with previous communications illustrate similarities and differences in the regulation PAH and non-PAH smooth muscle cell contraction relating to calcium translocation, RhoA/ROCK signaling and the activity of caldesmon. These findings may provide useful tools in achieving the regulation of the vascular hypercontractility taking place in PAH.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jamie L.

Applying MASC to mass cytometry analyses of CD4+ T cells from blood of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and controls revealed a significantly expanded population of CD4+ T cells, identified as CD27- HLA-DR+ effector memory cells, in RA patients (OR = 1.7; p = 0.0011). The frequency of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells was similarly elevated in blood samples from a second RA patient cohort, and CD27- HLA-DR+ cell frequency decreased in RA patients who respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Compared to peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue samples from RA patients contained ~5-fold higher frequencies of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells, which comprised ~10% of synovial CD4+ T cells. We find that CD27- HLA-DR+ cells are abundant producers of IFN-{gamma} and also express perforin and granzyme A at elevated levels. Thus MASC identified the expansion of a unique Th1 skewed effector T cell population with cytotoxic capacity in RA.

We propose that MASC is a broadly applicable method to identify disease-associated cell populations in high-dimensional single cell data.</content></content></item><item><published>1520924400000</published><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1621ea75a37:2c77d9:34f43e70</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/JikLWKYF1dU/s41598-018-22721-y</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>8824b2dd</fingerprint><author><name>Naoki Yahata</name></author><crawled>1520932706871</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&amp;amp;gt;A mutation, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22721-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/JikLWKYF1dU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&amp;amp;gt;A mutation, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22721-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/JikLWKYF1dU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1520974800000</published><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><engagement>11</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002988</originId><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162208665b0:15c9c42:76251cdd</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002988</href></item></canonical><title>Early uneven ear input induces long-lasting differences in left–right motor function</title><recrawled>1520967605395</recrawled><fingerprint>f5e24f74</fingerprint><author><name>Michelle W.

How asymmetries in motor behavior become established normally or atypically in mammals remains unclear. An established model for motor asymmetry that is conserved across mammals can be obtained by experimentally inducing asymmetric striatal dopamine activity. However, the factors that can cause motor asymmetries in the absence of experimental manipulations to the brain remain unknown. Here, we show that mice with inner ear dysfunction display a robust left or right rotational preference, and this motor preference reflects an atypical asymmetry in cortico-striatal neurotransmission. By unilaterally targeting striatal activity with an antagonist of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a downstream integrator of striatal neurotransmitter signaling, we can reverse or exaggerate rotational preference in these mice. By surgically biasing vestibular failure to one ear, we can dictate the direction of motor preference, illustrating the influence of uneven vestibular failure in establishing the outward asymmetries in motor preference. The inner ear–induced striatal asymmetries identified here intersect with non–ear-induced asymmetries previously linked to lateralized motor behavior across species and suggest that aspects of left–right brain function in mammals can be ontogenetically influenced by inner ear input. Consistent with inner ear input contributing to motor asymmetry, we also show that, in humans with normal ear function, the motor-dominant hemisphere, measured as handedness, is ipsilateral to the ear with weaker vestibular input.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/t_G6MO4max4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michelle W.

In tropical and subtropical lakes, eutrophication often leads to nuisance blooms of &lt;i&gt;Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii&lt;/i&gt;. In laboratory experiments, we tested the combined effects of flocculant polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB) on the sinking and growth rates of three &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of PAC and LMB would (1) effectively sink &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; in a test tube experiment and (2) impair &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; growth, irrespective of the biomass of the inoculum (bloom) and the strain in the growth experiment. We tested the recommended (LMB1) and a three-times higher dose of LMB (LMB3). The combined addition of PAC and LMB enhanced the sedimentation of all &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; strains. Moreover, both the PAC and LMB doses decreased the phosphate concentration. PAC and LMB1 decreased the growth rate of all strains, but the efficacy depended on the biomass and strain. The combined addition of PAC and LMB3 inhibited the growth of all strains independently of the biomass and strain. We conclude that a low dose of PAC in combination with the recommended dose of LMB decreases &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms and that the efficiency of the technique depends on the biomass of the bloom. A higher dose of LMB is needed to obtain a more efficient control of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;raciborskii&lt;/i&gt; blooms.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fabiana Araújo, Frank van Oosterhout, Vanessa Becker, José Luiz Attayde, Miquel Lürling&lt;/p&gt;

Experimental philosophy (x-phi) is a young field of research in the intersection of philosophy and psychology. It aims to make progress on philosophical questions by using experimental methods traditionally associated with the psychological and behavioral sciences, such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Motivated by recent discussions about a methodological crisis in the behavioral sciences, questions have been raised about the methodological standards of x-phi. Here, we focus on one aspect of this question, namely the &lt;i&gt;rate of inconsistencies in statistical reporting&lt;/i&gt;. Previous research has examined the extent to which published articles in psychology and other behavioral sciences present statistical inconsistencies in reporting the results of NHST. In this study, we used the R package statcheck to detect statistical inconsistencies in x-phi, and compared rates of inconsistencies in psychology and philosophy. We found that rates of inconsistencies in x-phi are lower than in the psychological and behavioral sciences. From the point of view of statistical reporting consistency, x-phi seems to do no worse, and perhaps even better, than psychological science.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Matteo Colombo, Georgi Duev, Michèle B.

Early diagnosis is critical for individuals with Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) in clinical practice because its progress is irreversible. In the existing literature, support vector machine (SVM) has always been applied to distinguish between AD and healthy controls (HC) based on neuroimaging data. But previous studies have only used a single SVM to classify AD and HC, and the accuracy is not very high and generally less than 90%. The method of random support vector machine cluster was proposed to classify AD and HC in this paper. From the Alzheimer&apos;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification accuracy could reach to 94.44% in the results. Furthermore, the method could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be maintained at the level of 94.44%. In addition, we could also find out abnormal brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and cingulate cortex). It is worth noting that the proposed random support vector machine cluster could be a new insight to help the diagnosis of AD.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xia-an Bi, Qing Shu, Qi Sun, Qian Xu&lt;/p&gt;

Antennal sensory units in nymphs and adults of the spotted Lanternfly, &lt;i&gt;Lycorma delicatula&lt;/i&gt; (White) (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Fulgoridae), an economically important plant pest, are studied with scanning electron microscopy. Sensilla trichodea / chaetica type recognition is based on their external morphology and ratio of their size to diameter. The flagellum Bourgoin’s organ is a complex sensory unit with 2–3 internal sensilla coeloconica. During nymphal stages, the sensory surface available for a chemoreceptive function particularly increases with the number and size of sensilla placodea on the antennal pedicel. From first to fourth instar and to adult males and females, plate organ sensory surface is estimated to increase respectively by 33x, 68x and 125x (= 2.72 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.02 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively for males and females). The most important increase (5x) occurs between second and third instar. In parallel, a distinctive pair of plate organs on the flagellum decreases in size from first to third instar, and disappears.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. This warrants a search for risk factors of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1±8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days. Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; &amp;lt;15 [reference category], 15-&amp;lt;30, ≥30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.30 (95%CI = 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.71 (-1.08; -0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Remy J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1—transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, without and with NF-κB activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium. NF-κB-activation of BEC caused &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; expression of SUR1-TRPM4 channels. In NF-κB-activated BEC: (i) tPA caused opening of SUR1-TRPM4 channels in a plasmin-, PAR1-, TRPC3- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner; (ii) tPA caused PAR1-dependent secretion of MMP-9; (iii) tonic secretion of MMP-9 by activated BEC was not influenced by SUR1 inhibition; (iv) phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA or the PAR1-agonist, TFLLR, required functional SUR1-TRPM4 channels, with inhibition of SUR1 decreasing tPA-induced MMP-9 secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;tPA induces PAR1-mediated, SUR1-TRPM4-dependent, phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Volodymyr Gerzanich, Min Seong Kwon, Seung Kyoon Woo, Alexander Ivanov, J.

Amino acid signaling mediated by the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is fundamental to cell growth and metabolism. However, how cells negatively regulate amino acid signaling remains largely unknown. Here, we show that interaction between 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), a subunit of multiple amino acid transporters, and the multifunctional hub protein girders of actin filaments (Girdin) down-regulates mTORC1 activity. 4F2hc interacts with Girdin in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- and amino acid signaling–dependent manners to translocate to the lysosome. The resultant decrease in cell surface 4F2hc leads to lowered cytoplasmic glutamine (Gln) and leucine (Leu) content, which down-regulates amino acid signaling. Consistently, Girdin depletion augments amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation and inhibits amino acid deprivation–induced autophagy. These findings uncovered the mechanism underlying negative regulation of amino acid signaling, which may play a role in tightly regulated cell growth and metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tMWvVxdBQbk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Liang Weng, Yi-Peng Han, Atsushi Enomoto, Yasuyuki Kitaura, Shushi Nagamori, Yoshikatsu Kanai, Naoya Asai, Jian An, Maki Takagishi, Masato Asai, Shinji Mii, Takashi Masuko, Yoshiharu Shimomura, Masahide Takahashi&lt;/p&gt;

Anti-drug antibody formation occurs with most biological agents across disease states, but the mechanism by which they are formed is unknown. The formation of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab (AAA) may decrease its therapeutic effects in some patients. HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with autoantibody formation against interferons and other TNF inhibitors, but not adalimumab. We analyzed samples from 634 subjects with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS): 37 subjects (17 RA and 20 HS) developed AAA (AAA+) during adalimumab treatment and 597 subjects (348 RA, 249 HS) did not develop AAA (AAA-) during the clinical trials. Using next-generation sequencing-based HLA typing, we identified three protective HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1*05, HLA-DRB1*01,and HLA-DRB1*07) that were less prevalent in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 0.4, 0.25 and 0.28, respectively; and P values: 0.012, 0.012 and 0.018, respectively) and two risk HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*011) that were more abundant in AAA+ than AAA–subjects (ORs: 2.52, and 2.64, respectively; and P values: 0.006 and 0.019). Similar to the finding of Billiet &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. who found that carriage of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was more prevalent in those with anti-infliximab antibodies (OR = 3.6, p = 0.002, 95% CI: [1.5,8.6]).), we found HLA-DRB1*03 allele was also more prevalent in anti-adalimumab positive (OR = 2.52, p = 0.006, 95% CI: [1.37,4.63]). The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohan Liu, Jacob Degner, Justin Wade Davis, Kenneth B.

The results suggest that specific HLA alleles may play a key role in developing AAAs in RA and HS patients treated with adalimumab.</content></content></item><item><published>1521740379000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Human impact on African forests</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:415042c:9f3b30f2</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1374-a?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1374.1.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1374-a?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>8823941e</fingerprint><author><name>Sugden, A.

Sunscreen users are often inadequately protected and become sunburned. This study aimed to investigate how much two consecutive sunscreen applications increased the quantity of sunscreen applied and decreased the skin area left without sunscreen (missed area) compared to a single application. Thirty-one healthy volunteers wearing swimwear were included and applied sunscreen two consecutive times in a laboratory environment. Participants had pictures taken in black light before and after each application. As sunscreens absorb black light, the darkness of the skin increased with increasing amounts of sunscreen applied. We conducted a standard curve establishing a link between change in picture darkness and quantity of sunscreen. The quantity of sunscreen at selected skin sites as well as the percentage of missed area was determined after each application. Participants had missed a median of 20% of their available body surface after a single application. After double application they had missed 9%. The decrease in missed areas was significant for the whole body surface and for each of the body regions separately. The median participant had applied between 13% and 100% more sunscreen at the selected skin sites after double application than after single application. We recommend double application, especially before intense sun exposure.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ida M. Heerfordt, Linnea R. Torsnes, Peter A.

Currently, non-invasive methods for studying the human brain do not routinely and reliably measure spike-rate-dependent signals, independent of responses such as hemodynamic coupling (fMRI) and subthreshold neuronal synchrony (oscillations and event-related potentials). In contrast, invasive methods—microelectrode recordings and electrocorticography (ECoG)—have recently measured broadband power elevation in field potentials (~50–200 Hz) as a proxy for locally averaged spike rates. Here, we sought to detect and quantify stimulus-related broadband responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Extracranial measurements like MEG and EEG have multiple global noise sources and relatively low signal-to-noise ratios; moreover high frequency artifacts from eye movements can be confounded with stimulus design and mistaken for signals originating from brain activity. For these reasons, we developed an automated denoising technique that helps reveal the broadband signal of interest. Subjects viewed 12-Hz contrast-reversing patterns in the left, right, or bilateral visual field. Sensor time series were separated into evoked (12-Hz amplitude) and broadband components (60–150 Hz). In all subjects, denoised broadband responses were reliably measured in sensors over occipital cortex, even in trials without microsaccades. The broadband pattern was stimulus-dependent, with greater power contralateral to the stimulus. Because we obtain reliable broadband estimates with short experiments (~20 minutes), and with sufficient signal-to-noise to distinguish responses to different stimuli, we conclude that MEG broadband signals, denoised with our method, offer a practical, non-invasive means for characterizing spike-rate-dependent neural activity for addressing scientific questions about human brain function.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eline R.

Some components of the neural circuits underlying innate odor-evoked responses have recently been elucidated. Odor information detected by the olfactory receptors is transmitted from the olfactory bulb to the cortical amygdala, where physiological and emotional states such as attraction or avoidance are controlled. Thus, activation of specific olfactory receptors can elicit changes in physiological and/or psychological state. Here, we examined on the odorant Hex-Hex Mix, which has been reported to induce anti-fatigue effects. Fatigue is a prevalent condition that is often related to overwork and psychological stress. Various anti-fatigue treatments have been developed, including supplements and odorants. However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-fatigue effects of these substances are currently unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the involvement of the olfactory system in the mechanisms underlying this effect. We identified the human olfactory receptors activated by Hex-Hex Mix, and evaluated whether activation of these olfactory receptors by a newly developed odorant elicited a similar anti-fatigue effect to Hex-Hex Mix. We assessed anti-fatigue effects with behavioral tests, and 17 healthy males performed the 2-back test as a fatigue-inducing task with or without exposure to the new odorant. Immediately before and after the task, participants performed a cognitive task to evaluate their level of mental fatigue. We found that the difference value of the correct response rate on the cognitive task in the evaluation session was significantly different between in the odorant condition and in the without-odorant condition during the fatigue-inducing session suggesting that the new odorant may improve performance in the fatigue-inducing condition. The results indicated that the new odorant activates the same olfactory receptors as Hex-Hex Mix, which has been reported to induce anti-fatigue effects. Our findings suggest that the olfactory receptors in the olfactory system may be involved in the attenuation of fatigue.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naoko Saito, Emi Yamano, Akira Ishii, Masaaki Tanaka, Junji Nakamura, Yasuyoshi Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;

Plastic pollution has been well documented in natural environments, including the open waters and sediments within lakes and rivers, the open ocean and even the air, but less attention has been paid to synthetic polymers in human consumables. Since multiple toxicity studies indicate risks to human health when plastic particles are ingested, more needs to be known about the presence and abundance of anthropogenic particles in human foods and beverages. This study investigates the presence of anthropogenic particles in 159 samples of globally sourced tap water, 12 brands of Laurentian Great Lakes beer, and 12 brands of commercial sea salt. Of the tap water samples analyzed, 81% were found to contain anthropogenic particles. The majority of these particles were fibers (98.3%) between 0.1–5 mm in length. The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99% were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg. Based on consumer guidelines, our results indicate the average person ingests over 5,800 particles of synthetic debris from these three sources annually, with the largest contribution coming from tap water (88%).</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mary Kosuth, Sherri A.

The anatomical location of adipose tissue might have direct implications for its functionality and risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. To determine the expression of genes related to energy expenditure and the levels of some adipokines, histological examinations, quantitative PCR, and protein expression measurements in adipocyte precursor cells were performed. Periaortic adipocytes were smaller than those from subcutaneous tissue. Moreover, weight gain induced periaortic adipocyte hypertrophy (r = -0.91, p&amp;lt;0.01). Compared to subcutaneous tissue, adiponectin, FABP4, IL-4 and IL-6 was decreased in periaortic adipocytes, whereas FGF21, UCP-1, PGC-1a, CITED1, Omentin and TFAM (Mitochondrial protein) increased. Upon analyzing patients’ clinical conditions, it emerged that the levels of PGC-1a both in male (r = -0.48 p&amp;lt;0.04) and female (r = -0.61, p&amp;lt;0.05) and TFAM in male (r = -0.72, p&amp;lt;0.0008) and female (r = -0.86, p&amp;lt;0.002) decreased significantly with progressive weight gain. However, no differences were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus 2 or Hyperlipidemia. Adipocytes surrounding the ascending aorta present markers of major thermogenic activity than those in subcutaneous tissue. Nevertheless, this characteristic might change, due to unfavorable metabolic conditions such as obesity, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Vargas, Carolina López, Edward Acero, Edgar Benitez, Angélica Wintaco, Jaime Camacho, Marisol Carreño, Juan Umaña, Daniela Jimenez, Said Díaz, Fernando Lizcano&lt;/p&gt;

Tissue perfusion during surgery is important in reducing surgical site infections and promoting healing. This study aimed to determine if insufflation of the open abdomen with heated, humidified (HH) carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) increased visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature during open abdominal surgery in a rodent model. Using two different rodent models of open abdominal surgery, visceral perfusion and core temperature were measured. Visceral perfusion was investigated using a repeated measures crossover experiment with rodents receiving the same sequence of two alternating treatments: exposure to ambient air (no insufflation) and insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Core body temperature was measured using an independent experimental design with three treatment groups: ambient air, HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cold, dry (CD) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Visceral perfusion was measured by laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) and core body temperature was measured with a rectal thermometer. Insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a rodent open abdominal cavity significantly increased visceral tissue perfusion (2.4 perfusion units (PU)/min (95% CI 1.23–3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001) compared with ambient air, which significantly reduced visceral blood flow (-5.20 PU/min (95% CI -6.83- -3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001). Insufflation of HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the open abdominal cavity significantly increased core body temperature (+1.15 ± 0.14°C) compared with open cavities exposed to ambient air (-0.65 ± 0.52°C; p = 0.037), or cavities insufflated with CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (-0.73 ± 0.33°C; p = 0.006). Abdominal visceral temperatures also increased with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insufflation compared with ambient air or CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown by infrared thermography.

Determining the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors on genetic connectivity among populations remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology and in the management and conservation of species. North Pacific hake (&lt;i&gt;Merluccius productus&lt;/i&gt;) inhabits upwelling regions in the California Current ecosystem from the Gulf of California to the Gulf of Alaska. In this study, we examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite variation to estimate levels of genetic differentiation of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;productus&lt;/i&gt; in relation to the role of oceanographic features as potential barriers to gene flow. Samples were obtained from nine sites spanning a large part of the geographic range of the species, from Puget Sound, Washington to Costa Rica. The microsatellite results revealed three genetically discrete populations: one spanning the eastern Pacific coast, and two apparently resident populations circumscribed to the Puget Sound and the northern Gulf of California (F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.032, p = 0.036). Cytochrome b sequence data indicated that isolation between the Puget Sound and northern Gulf of California populations from the coastal Pacific were recent phenomena (18.5 kyr for Puget Sound and 40 kyr for the northern Gulf of California). Oceanographic data obtained from the Gulf of California support the hypothesis that permanent fronts within the region, and strong gradients at the entrance to the Gulf of California act as barriers to gene flow. A seascape genetics approach found significant genetic–environment associations, where the daytime sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentrations were the best predictive variables for the observed genetic differentiation. Considering the potential causes of genetic isolation among the three populations, e.g. spawning areas in different latitudes associated with upwelling processes, oceanographic barriers, asymmetric migration and specialized diet, oceanographic barriers appear to be a likely mechanism restricting gene flow.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francisco Javier García-De León, Carolina Galván-Tirado, Laura Sánchez Velasco, Claudia A.

Considering the potential causes of genetic isolation among the three populations, e.g. spawning areas in different latitudes associated with upwelling processes, oceanographic barriers, asymmetric migration and specialized diet, oceanographic barriers appear to be a likely mechanism restricting gene flow.</content></content></item><item><published>1522134000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>Neural Data Visualization for Scalable and Generalizable Single Cell Analysis [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289223v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162676049be:608969d:7d6c1c1c</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/289223</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289223v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>faf17e62</fingerprint><author><name>Cho, H.</name></author><crawled>1522152786366</crawled><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289223v1?rss=1</link><description>Single-cell RNA sequencing is becoming effective and accessible as emerging technologies push its scale to millions of cells and beyond.

We describe a computational model of social norms based on identifying values that a certain culture finds desirable such as dignity, generosity and politeness. The model quantifies these values in the form of Culture-Sanctioned Social Metrics (CSSMs) and treats social norms as the requirement to maximize these metrics from the perspective of the self, peers and public. This model can be used to create realistic social simulations, to explain or predict human behavior in specific scenarios, or as a component of robots or agents that need to interact with humans in specific social-cultural settings. We validate the model by using it to represent a complex deception scenario and showing that it can yield non-trivial insights such as the explanation of apparently irrational human behavior.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ladislau Bölöni, Taranjeet Singh Bhatia, Saad Ahmad Khan, Jonathan Streater, Stephen M.

We validate the model by using it to represent a complex deception scenario and showing that it can yield non-trivial insights such as the explanation of apparently irrational human behavior.</content></content></item><item><published>1521000000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00605/20180306/images/medium/oc-2017-00605d_0007.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>500</height><width>360</width></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00605/20180306/images/medium/oc-2017-00605d_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.7b00605&lt;/div&gt;</content></summary><title>[ASAP] Rapid, Selective Heavy Metal Removal from Water by a Metal–Organic Framework/Polydopamine Composite</title><engagement>25</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_1622581b095:457cbc:76251cdd</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00605</originId><recrawled>1521570583293</recrawled><fingerprint>a19de98c</fingerprint><author><name>Daniel T.

The overall genovars were distributed as E (41.9%), G (21.6%), F (13.5%), K (9.5%), D (6.8%), J (4.1%), and H (2.7%). CT-positive samples were from males (n = 12, 19.7%), females (n = 42, 68.8%), and anonymous (n = 7, 11.5%) patients, with an age range of 19 to 45 years (average 26.4), including 12 different ethnic groups representative of this region. Most patients were infected with a single genovar (82%), while 18% were co-infected with either two or three genovars. The 1156 bp-fragment of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene was sequenced in 46 samples to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among isolates. SNP-based subtyping and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of 13 variants of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene, such as E (E1, E2, E6), G (G1, G2, G3, G5), F1, K, D (D1, Da2), J1, and H2.

Time delays are known to play a crucial role in generating biological oscillations. The early embryonic cell cycle in the frog &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; is one such example. Although various mathematical models of this oscillating system exist, it is not clear how to best model the required time delay. Here, we study a simple cell cycle model that produces oscillations due to the presence of an ultrasensitive, time-delayed negative feedback loop. We implement the time delay in three qualitatively different ways, using a fixed time delay, a distribution of time delays, and a delay that is state-dependent. We analyze the dynamics in all cases, and we use experimental observations to interpret our results and put constraints on unknown parameters. In doing so, we find that different implementations of the time delay can have a large impact on the resulting oscillations.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jan Rombouts, Alexandra Vandervelde, Lendert Gelens&lt;/p&gt;

Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet), an oral calcimimetic agent has been widely used for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In sharp contrast to vitamin D receptor activators, cinacalcet suppresses SHPT without inducing hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. Nevertheless, some patients remain refractory to SHPT with this agent, as the dose cannot be sufficiently increased due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In order to resolve this issue, we have developed a newly synthesized calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580). In a rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, oral administration of evocalcet efficiently suppressed the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). With regard to the gastro-intestinal effects, cinacalcet induced a significant delay in gastric emptying in rats, while evocalcet did no marked effects on it. Evocalcet also demonstrated the less induction of emesis compared to cinacalcet in common marmosets. The pharmacological effects of evocalcet were observed at lower doses because of its higher bioavailability than cinacalcet, which may have contributed to the reduced GI tract symptoms. In addition, evocalcet showed no substantial direct inhibition of any CYP isozymes in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; liver microsome assay, suggesting a better profile in drug interactions than cinacalcet that inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. These findings suggest that evocalcet can be a better alternative to cinacalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, with a wider safety margin.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takehisa Kawata, Shin Tokunaga, Miki Murai, Nami Masuda, Waka Haruyama, Youji Shoukei, Yutaka Hisada, Tetsuya Yanagida, Hiroshi Miyazaki, Michihito Wada, Tadao Akizawa, Masafumi Fukagawa&lt;/p&gt;

The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is an evolutionary conserved cholesterol binding protein localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Expression of TSPO is upregulated in activated microglia in various neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic disorders. Therefore, TSPO radioligands are used as biomarkers in positron emission tomography (PET) studies. In particular, a common A147T polymorphism in the TSPO gene affects binding of several high affinity TSPO radioligands. Given the relevance of TSPO as a diagnostic biomarker in disease processes, we systematically searched for mutations in the human TSPO gene by a wide array of evolution and structure based bioinformatics tools and identified potentially deleterious missense mutations. The two most frequently observed missense mutations A147T and R162H were further analysed in structural models of human wildtype and mutant TSPO proteins. The effects of missense mutations were studied on the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations. To analyse putative effects of A147T and R162H variants on protein stability we established primary dermal fibroblast cultures from wt and homozygous A147T and R162H donors. Stability of endogenous TSPO protein, which is abundantly expressed in fibroblasts, was studied using cycloheximide protein degradation assay. Our data show that the A147T mutation significantly alters the flexibility and stability of the mutant protein. Furthermore both A147T and R162H mutations decreased the half-life of the mutant proteins by about 25 percent, which could in part explain its effect on reduced pregnenolone production and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study is the first comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of genetic variants in the TSPO gene, thereby extending the knowledge about the clinical relevance of TSPO nsSNPs.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vladimir M.

Strategic purchasing is an essential health financing function. This paper compares the strategic purchasing practices of Thailand’s two tax-financed health insurance schemes, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), and identifies factors contributing to successful universal health coverage outcomes by analysing the relationships between the purchaser and government, providers and members. The study uses a cross-sectional mixed-methods design, including document review and interviews with 56 key informants. The Comptroller General Department (CGD) of Ministry of Finance manages CSMBS as one among civil servant welfare programmes. Their purchasing is passive. Fee for service payment for outpatient care has resulted in rapid cost escalation and overspending of their annual budget. In contrast, National Health Security Office (NHSO) manages purchasing for UCS, which undertakes a range of strategic purchasing actions, including applying closed ended provider payment, promoting primary healthcare’s gate keeping functions, exercising collective purchasing power and engaging views of members in decision making process. This difference in purchasing arrangements resulted in expenditure per CSMBS member being 4 times higher than UCS in 2014. The governance of the purchaser organization, the design of the purchasing arrangements including incentives and use of information, and the institutional capacities to implement purchasing functions are essential for effective strategic purchasing which can improve health system efficiency as a whole.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Walaiporn Patcharanarumol, Warisa Panichkriangkrai, Angkana Sommanuttaweechai, Kara Hanson, Yaowaluk Wanwong, Viroj Tangcharoensathien&lt;/p&gt;

Almost one third of the three million people in China suffering severe deafness are children, and 50% of these cases are believed to have genetic components to their etiology. Newborn hearing genetic screening can complement Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening for the diagnosis of congenital hearing loss as well as identifying children at risk for late-onset and progressive hearing impairment. The aim of this joint academic and Ministry of Health project was to prototype a cost effective newborn genetic screen in a community health setting on a city-wide level, and to ascertain the prevalence of variation at loci that have been associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. With the participation of 143 local hospitals in the city of Wuhan, China we screened 142,417 neonates born between May 2014 and Dec. 2015. The variants GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G, and mitochondrial variants m.1555A&gt;G and m.1494C&gt;T were assayed using real time PCR. Newborns found to carry a variant were re-assayed by sequencing in duplicate. Within a subset of 707 newborns we assayed using real-time PCR and ARMS-PCR to compare cost, sensitivity and operating procedure. The most frequent hearing loss associated allele detected in this population was the 235delC variant in GJB2 gene. In total, 4289 (3.01%) newborns were found to carry at least one allele of either GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G or two assayed MT-RNR1 variants. There was complete accordance between the real-time PCR and the ARMS PCR, though the real-time PCR had a much lower failure rate. Real-time PCR had a lower cost and operating time than ARMS PCR. Ongoing collaboration with the participating hospitals will determine the specificity and sensitivity of the association of the variants with hearing loss at birth and arising in early childhood, allowing an estimation of the benefits of newborn hearing genetic screening in a large-scale community setting.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zongjie Hao, Denggang Fu, Yang Ming, Jinlong Yang, Qi Huang, Weilong Lin, Huan Zhang, Bin Zhang, Aifen Zhou, Xijiang Hu, Cong Yao, Yunping Dong, Huijun Z.

Devils Hole is the sole natural habitat of the critically endangered Devils Hole pupfish (&lt;i&gt;Cyprinodon diabolis&lt;/i&gt;). To establish a backup population, the Ash Meadows Fish Conservation Facility (AMFCF), a full-scale replica of the uppermost 6.7 m of Devils Hole, was constructed by management agencies in the mid-2010s. Despite rigorous efforts to mimic the bathymetric and physical details of the Devils Hole environment, the biogeochemistry and microbiology of the AMFCF refuge tank remain largely unaddressed. We evaluated water physicochemistry and employed Illumina DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries to evaluate planktonic and benthic bacterial and archaeal community composition within their respective physicochemical contexts in Devils Hole and AMFCF on the same day. Major ion concentrations were consistent between the two systems, but water temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics differed. Bioavailable nitrogen (primarily nitrate) was 5x lower in AMFCF. Devils Hole and AMFCF nitrogen:phosphorus molar ratios were 107:1 and 22:1, indicative of different nutrient control mechanisms. Both sites are microbiologically diverse, with over 40 prokaryotic phyla represented at each, with 37 shared between them and nearly than half deriving from candidate divisions. The abundance and composition of predicted photosynthetic primary producers (Cyanobacteria) was markedly different between sites: Devils Hole planktonic and sediment communities were dominated by &lt;i&gt;Oscillatoria spp&lt;/i&gt;. (13.2% mean relative abundance), which proved virtually undetectable in AMFCF.

Devils Hole is the sole natural habitat of the critically endangered Devils Hole pupfish (&lt;i&gt;Cyprinodon diabolis&lt;/i&gt;). To establish a backup population, the Ash Meadows Fish Conservation Facility (AMFCF), a full-scale replica of the uppermost 6.7 m of Devils Hole, was constructed by management agencies in the mid-2010s. Despite rigorous efforts to mimic the bathymetric and physical details of the Devils Hole environment, the biogeochemistry and microbiology of the AMFCF refuge tank remain largely unaddressed. We evaluated water physicochemistry and employed Illumina DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries to evaluate planktonic and benthic bacterial and archaeal community composition within their respective physicochemical contexts in Devils Hole and AMFCF on the same day. Major ion concentrations were consistent between the two systems, but water temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics differed. Bioavailable nitrogen (primarily nitrate) was 5x lower in AMFCF. Devils Hole and AMFCF nitrogen:phosphorus molar ratios were 107:1 and 22:1, indicative of different nutrient control mechanisms. Both sites are microbiologically diverse, with over 40 prokaryotic phyla represented at each, with 37 shared between them and nearly than half deriving from candidate divisions. The abundance and composition of predicted photosynthetic primary producers (Cyanobacteria) was markedly different between sites: Devils Hole planktonic and sediment communities were dominated by &lt;i&gt;Oscillatoria spp&lt;/i&gt;. (13.2% mean relative abundance), which proved virtually undetectable in AMFCF. Conversely, AMFCF was dominated by a predicted heterotroph from the Verrucomicrobiaceae family (31.7%); which was comparatively rare (&amp;lt;2.4%) in Devils Hole. We propose that the paucity of bioavailable nitrogen in AMFCF, perhaps resulting from physical isolation from allochthonous environmental inputs, is reflected in the microbial assemblage disparity, influences biogeochemical cycling of other dissolved constituents, and may ultimately impact survivorship and recruitment of refuge populations of the Devils Hole pupfish.</content></content></item><item><published>1523566800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195761</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c4:9f3b30f2</id><title>Validation of CZECANCA (CZEch CAncer paNel for Clinical Application) for targeted NGS-based analysis of hereditary cancer syndromes</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195761</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>e0e68f1a</fingerprint><author><name>Jana Soukupova</name></author><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195761</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jana Soukupova, Petra Zemankova, Klara Lhotova, Marketa Janatova, Marianna Borecka, Lenka Stolarova, Filip Lhota, Lenka Foretova, Eva Machackova, Viktor Stranecky, Spiros Tavandzis, Petra Kleiblova, Michal Vocka, Hana Hartmannova, Katerina Hodanova, Stanislav Kmoch, Zdenek Kleibl&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Carriers of mutations in hereditary cancer predisposition genes represent a small but clinically important subgroup of oncology patients. The identification of causal germline mutations determines follow-up management, treatment options and genetic counselling in patients’ families. Targeted next-generation sequencing-based analyses using cancer-specific panels in high-risk individuals have been rapidly adopted by diagnostic laboratories. While the use of diagnosis-specific panels is straightforward in typical cases, individuals with unusual phenotypes from families with overlapping criteria require multiple panel testing. Moreover, narrow gene panels are limited by our currently incomplete knowledge about possible genetic dispositions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We have designed a multi-gene panel called CZECANCA (CZEch CAncer paNel for Clinical Application) for a sequencing analysis of 219 cancer-susceptibility and candidate predisposition genes associated with frequent hereditary cancers.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The bioanalytical and bioinformatics pipeline was validated on a set of internal and commercially available DNA controls showing high coverage uniformity, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The panel demonstrates a reliable detection of both single nucleotide and copy number variants. Inter-laboratory, intra- and inter-run replicates confirmed the robustness of our approach.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The objective of CZECANCA is a nationwide consolidation of cancer-predisposition genetic testing across various clinical indications with savings in costs, human labor and turnaround time. Moreover, the unified diagnostics will enable the integration and analysis of genotypes with associated phenotypes in a national database improving the clinical interpretation of variants.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jana Soukupova, Petra Zemankova, Klara Lhotova, Marketa Janatova, Marianna Borecka, Lenka Stolarova, Filip Lhota, Lenka Foretova, Eva Machackova, Viktor Stranecky, Spiros Tavandzis, Petra Kleiblova, Michal Vocka, Hana Hartmannova, Katerina Hodanova, Stanislav Kmoch, Zdenek Kleibl&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The incidence rate of breast cancer is increasing and has become the most common cancer in Vietnamese women while the survival rate is lower than that of developed countries. Early detection to improve breast cancer survival as well as reducing risk factors remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This study aims to evaluate the costs and outcomes of introducing a mammography screening program for Vietnamese women aged 45–64 years, compared to the current situation of no screening.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Decision analytical modeling using Markov chain analysis was used to estimate costs and health outcomes over a lifetime horizon. Model inputs were derived from published literature and the results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and/or incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs). One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The ICER per life year gained of the first round of mammography screening was US$3647.06 and US$4405.44 for women aged 50–54 years and 55–59 years, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, mammography screening in the 50–54 age group and the 55–59 age group were cost-effective in 100% of cases at a threshold of three times the Vietnamese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) i.e., US$6332.70. However, less than 50% of the cases in the 60–64 age group and 0% of the cases in the 45–49 age group were cost effective at the WHO threshold. The ICERs were sensitive to the discount rate, mammography sensitivity, and transition probability from remission to distant recurrence in stage II for all age groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From the healthcare payer viewpoint, offering the first round of mammography screening to Vietnamese women aged 50–59 years should be considered, with the given threshold of three times the Vietnamese GDP per capita.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chi Phuong Nguyen, Eddy M.

Background &lt;p&gt;The need to evaluate the human health safety of fishery resources remain urgent in the mist of the ever-increasing fear of heavy metal toxicity from the consumption of Ghana’s fisheries resource, as a consequence of pollution from several anthropogenic activities including artisanal gold mining. Nevertheless, the bigeye grunt (&lt;i&gt;Brachydeuterus auritus&lt;/i&gt;) and Bagrid catfish (&lt;i&gt;Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt;) remain commercially valuable fish species in West Africa and continue to attract high patronage.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Forty-five specimens each of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; collected from the Weija Dam and the Tema Fishing Habour in Ghana, between June and September 2016, were analysed for seven heavy metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Lead and Cadmium were below detection in all samples while Cu was not detected in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Levels of the remaining metals (mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) were below FAO/WHO maximum permissible limits in fish and occurred in the rank order Se (3.5) &gt; Zn (2.34) &gt; Cu (0.59) &gt; As (0.37) &gt; Hg (0.19) in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Se (2.97) &gt; Zn (2.28) &gt; Hg (0.31) &gt; As (0.21) in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Only As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; recorded Estimated Weekly Intake (EWI) greater than FAO/WHO Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI). Also, As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Hg in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; had Targeted Hazard Quotient (THQ) greater than 1 for individuals consuming the fishes on daily basis and therefore, raising concerns. However, for both species of fish, cancer risk of As was 1 in 10,000,000,000 and modified Health Benefits values of Se (HBV&lt;sub&gt;Se&lt;/sub&gt;) were positive indicating the health risks that might accompany Hg exposure would be negated. Since toxicity depends on the concentration and quantity of a pollutant consumed, safe maximum consumption rate of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; based on As concentrations was 0.21 mg per day and that of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; was 0.058 mg per day for Hg. With an average of 0.227 kg fish per meal of an adult human, these translated into not more than 24 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and nine (9) &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; meals in a month but because fish is consumed at 0.0685 kg per person per day in Ghana, these values respectively translates to 93 and 30 safe days of consumption per month.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;At the rate of 0.0685 kg fish per person per day that fish is consumed in Ghana, the consumption of the two species of fish in Ghana would essentially be of little or no consequence to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Gbogbo, Anna Arthur-Yartel, Josephine A.

Nevertheless, the bigeye grunt (&lt;i&gt;Brachydeuterus auritus&lt;/i&gt;) and Bagrid catfish (&lt;i&gt;Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt;) remain commercially valuable fish species in West Africa and continue to attract high patronage.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Forty-five specimens each of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; collected from the Weija Dam and the Tema Fishing Habour in Ghana, between June and September 2016, were analysed for seven heavy metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Lead and Cadmium were below detection in all samples while Cu was not detected in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Levels of the remaining metals (mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) were below FAO/WHO maximum permissible limits in fish and occurred in the rank order Se (3.5) &gt; Zn (2.34) &gt; Cu (0.59) &gt; As (0.37) &gt; Hg (0.19) in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Se (2.97) &gt; Zn (2.28) &gt; Hg (0.31) &gt; As (0.21) in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;. Only As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; recorded Estimated Weekly Intake (EWI) greater than FAO/WHO Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI). Also, As in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and Hg in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; had Targeted Hazard Quotient (THQ) greater than 1 for individuals consuming the fishes on daily basis and therefore, raising concerns. However, for both species of fish, cancer risk of As was 1 in 10,000,000,000 and modified Health Benefits values of Se (HBV&lt;sub&gt;Se&lt;/sub&gt;) were positive indicating the health risks that might accompany Hg exposure would be negated. Since toxicity depends on the concentration and quantity of a pollutant consumed, safe maximum consumption rate of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; based on As concentrations was 0.21 mg per day and that of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; was 0.058 mg per day for Hg. With an average of 0.227 kg fish per meal of an adult human, these translated into not more than 24 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and nine (9) &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; meals in a month but because fish is consumed at 0.0685 kg per person per day in Ghana, these values respectively translates to 93 and 30 safe days of consumption per month.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;At the rate of 0.0685 kg fish per person per day that fish is consumed in Ghana, the consumption of the two species of fish in Ghana would essentially be of little or no consequence to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522357200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195138</canonicalUrl><updated>1522357200000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195138</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde21:9f3b30f2</id><title>Genome-wide identification of wheat (&amp;lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&amp;lt;/i&gt;) expansins and expansin expression analysis in cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive wheat cultivars</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195138</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>dd3ca916</fingerprint><author><name>Jun-Feng Zhang</name></author><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195138</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jun-Feng Zhang, Yong-Qing Xu, Jia-Min Dong, Li-Na Peng, Xu Feng, Xu Wang, Fei Li, Yu Miao, Shu-Kuan Yao, Qiao-Qin Zhao, Shan-Shan Feng, Bao-Zhong Hu, Feng-Lan Li&lt;/p&gt;
Plant expansins are proteins involved in cell wall loosening, plant growth, and development, as well as in response to plant diseases and other stresses. In this study, we identified 128 expansin coding sequences from the wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt;) genome. These sequences belong to 45 homoeologous copies of &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt;, including 26 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPAs&lt;/i&gt;, 15 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPBs&lt;/i&gt; and four &lt;i&gt;TaEXLAs&lt;/i&gt;. No &lt;i&gt;TaEXLB&lt;/i&gt; was identified. Gene expression and sub-expression profiles revealed that most of the &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; were expressed either only in root tissues or in multiple organs. Real-time qPCR analysis showed that many &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; were differentially expressed in four different tissues of the two wheat cultivars—the cold-sensitive ‘Chinese Spring (CS)’ and the cold-tolerant ‘Dongnongdongmai 1 (D1)’ cultivars. Our results suggest that the differential expression of &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; could be related to low-temperature tolerance or sensitivity of different wheat cultivars. Our study expands our knowledge on wheat expansins and sheds new light on the functions of expansins in plant development and stress response.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jun-Feng Zhang, Yong-Qing Xu, Jia-Min Dong, Li-Na Peng, Xu Feng, Xu Wang, Fei Li, Yu Miao, Shu-Kuan Yao, Qiao-Qin Zhao, Shan-Shan Feng, Bao-Zhong Hu, Feng-Lan Li&lt;/p&gt;

The study aimed to compare the chronic eccentric-overload training effects of unilateral (lateral lunge) vs bilateral (half-squat) using an inertial device, on hypertrophy and physical performance. Twenty-seven young team sports male players performed a 4 sets of 7 repetitions of inertial eccentric overload training, biweekly for 6 weeks, distributed in unilateral lunge group (UG: age: 22.8 ± 2.9 years; body mass: 75.3 ± 8.8 kg; height: 177.3 ± 3.7 cm) and bilateral squat group (BG: age: 22.6 ± 2.7 years; body mass: 79.5 ± 12.8 kg; height: 164.2 ± 7 cm). Lower limb muscle volume, counter movement jump (CMJ), power with both (POWER), dominant (POWERd) and no-dominant leg (POWERnd), change of direction turn of 90° with dominant (COD90d) and no-dominant leg (COD90nd) and 180° (COD180d and COD180nd), and 10m sprint time (T-10m) were measured pre and post-intervention. The UG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;adductor major&lt;/i&gt; (+11.1%) and &lt;i&gt;vastus medialis&lt;/i&gt; (+12.6%) higher than BG. The BG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;vastus lateralis&lt;/i&gt; (+9.9%) and &lt;i&gt;lateral gastrocnemius&lt;/i&gt; (+9.1%) higher than UG. Both groups improved CMJ, POWER, POWERd, POWERnd, COD90 and DEC-COD90, without changes in T-10m. The UG decrease DEC-COD90nd (-21.1%) and BG increase POWER (+38.6%) substantially more than the other group. Six-weeks of unilateral / bilateral EO training induce substantial improvements in lower limbs muscle volume and functional performance, although unilateral training seems to be more effective in improving COD90 performance.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francisco Javier Núñez, Alfredo Santalla, Irene Carrasquila, Jose Antonio Asian, Jose Ignacio Reina, Luis Jesús Suarez-Arrones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; is an important cause of infection and commonly colonizes the nasopharynx of young children, along with other potentially pathogenic bacteria. The objectives of this study were to estimate the carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moraxella catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; in young children in Indonesia, and to examine interactions between these bacterial species. 302 healthy children aged 12–24 months were enrolled in community health centers in the Bandung, Central Lombok, and Padang regions. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and stored according to World Health Organization recommendations, and bacterial species detected by qPCR. Pneumococcal serotyping was conducted by microarray and latex agglutination/Quellung. Overall carriage prevalence was 49.5% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, 27.5% for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, 42.7% for &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and 7.3% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

Prior to pneumococcal vaccine introduction, pneumococcal carriage prevalence and serotype distribution varies among children living in different regions of Indonesia. Positive associations in both carriage and density identified among &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt; suggest a synergistic relationship among these species with potential clinical implications.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eileen M.

Densities of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt; were positively correlated when two of these species were present. Prior to pneumococcal vaccine introduction, pneumococcal carriage prevalence and serotype distribution varies among children living in different regions of Indonesia. Positive associations in both carriage and density identified among &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt; suggest a synergistic relationship among these species with potential clinical implications.</content></content></item><item><published>1522950073000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>University is quick to disclose misconduct</title><engagement>29</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/13?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529860:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/13.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/13?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>f75e7111</fingerprint><author><name>McCook, A., Retraction Watch</name></author><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/13?rss=1</link><keywords><item>Scientific Community, Science and Policy</item></keywords></item><item><published>1521666000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193953</canonicalUrl><updated>1521666000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193953</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087db:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Oral health-related quality of life of Portuguese adults with mild intellectual disabilities</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193953</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>a1b36a86</fingerprint><author><name>Patrícia Couto</name></author><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193953</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Patrícia Couto, Paulo Almeida Pereira, Manuel Nunes, Rui Amaral Mendes&lt;/p&gt;
Individuals with disabilities are regarded as a highly vulnerable population group, particularly as far as oral health is concern. However, few studies have assessed the impact of the oral condition on the quality of life of these individuals. Therefore, the aim of this study is to expand knowledge on the oral health status of the Portuguese adults with mild intellectual disability, and to assess how the patient’s oral health is related to their quality of life. A sample of 240 adults with mild intellectual disabilities linked to the Portuguese Federation for Intellectual Disability, were interviewed using a previously validated version of the Oral Health Impact Profile. An oral health examination was also conducted using three oral health indexes: Clinical Oral Health Index (COHI); Clinical Oral Care Needs Index (COCNI) and the Clinical Oral Prevention Index (COPI). Sociodemographic characteristics and dental health factors were also collected, following statistical analysis. More than half of the individuals (54,9%) presented one or more problems of major to severe impact on health (COHI level 2); only 4,6% of the individuals do not need treatment or examination (COCNI level 0) and 85% of the study sample needs measures of educational or preventive action (COPI level 1). In 76,9% of the participants, oral health had impact on the quality of life. The most affected dimensions of life were physical pain with 61,9%, followed by psychological discomfort and psychological disability with 45,1% and 45%, respectively. With relation to oral health factors and sociodemographic variables it was verified that fewer teeth and higher self-perception of need for dental treatment had a negative impact on the quality of life. On the other hand, institutionalization and an increase in at least one category in the self-perception of the oral health status had a positive impact on the quality of life. Given the high burden of oral disease and the considerable impact on quality of life found in this study, the establishment of guidelines to improve the oral health and quality of life of these individuals should be regarded as imperative.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Patrícia Couto, Paulo Almeida Pereira, Manuel Nunes, Rui Amaral Mendes&lt;/p&gt;

Vocal development is usually studied from the perspective of neuroscience. In this issue, Zhang and Ghazanfar propose a way in which body growth might condition the process. They study the vocalizations of marmoset infants with a wide range of techniques that include computational models and experiments that mimic growth reversal. Their results suggest that the qualitative changes that occur during development are rooted in the nonlinear interaction between the nervous system and the biomechanics involved in respiration. This work illustrates how an integrative approach enriches our understanding of behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zvNFkUWyj-M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel B.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The transcription factor SOX2 has been identified as a lineage survival oncogene in squamous cell carcinoma and copy number gain is a common event in several human malignancies including head and neck cancer. However, the regulation and function of SOX2 during carcinogenesis as well as its prognostic value appears to be highly context dependent. As an example, high SOX2 expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is related to a favorable prognosis, while it is associated with poor outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. More recently, higher SOX2 levels and improved survival was also reported for head and neck SCC (HNSCC), and silencing of SOX2 expression in HNSCC cell lines revealed a mesenchymal-like phenotype with prominent vimentin expression. So far, SOX2 expression and its clinical relevance for other head and neck cancers, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (HNACC) have not been sufficiently investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;SOX2, vimentin and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining on serial sections from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples of a patient cohort (n = 45) with primary ACC and correlated with patient and tumor characteristics as well as survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;High SOX2 expression was found in 14 (31%) primary tumor specimens and was significantly correlated with a N0 lymph node status (p = 0.04), while low SOX2 expression was correlated with a solid growth pattern (p = 0.031). Of the 45 patients, 27 tumor samples resembled an EMT-like phenotype, as assessed by high vimentin and low E-cadherin levels. However, in HNACC SOX2 levels were neither correlated with vimentin nor with E-cadherin expression, further supporting a context dependent regulation and function of SOX2 in distinct tumor entities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The absence of SOX2 was predominantly found in solid HNACC, which are characterized by a more aggressive phenotype in ACC.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;(1) To use finite element (FE) modelling to estimate local iris stresses (i.e. internal forces) as a result of mechanical pupil expansion; and to (2) compare such stresses as generated from several commercially available expanders (Iris hooks, APX dilator and Malyugin ring) to determine which design and deployment method are most likely to cause iris damage.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used a biofidelic 3-part iris FE model that consisted of the stroma, sphincter and dilator muscles. Our FE model simulated expansion of the pupil from 3 mm to a maximum of 6 mm using the aforementioned pupil expanders, with uniform circular expansion used for baseline comparison. FE-derived stresses, resultant forces and area of final pupil opening were compared across devices for analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our FE models demonstrated that the APX dilator generated the highest stresses on the sphincter muscles, (max: 6.446 MPa; average: 5.112 MPa), followed by the iris hooks (max: 5.680 MPa; average: 5.219 MPa), and the Malyugin ring (max: 2.144 MPa; average: 1.575 MPa). Uniform expansion generated the lowest stresses (max: 0.435MPa; average: 0.377 MPa). For pupil expansion, the APX dilator required the highest force (41.22 mN), followed by iris hooks (40.82 mN) and the Malyugin ring (18.56 mN).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study predicted that current pupil expanders exert significantly higher amount of stresses and forces than required during pupil expansion. Our work may serve as a guide for the development and design of next-generation pupil expanders.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Royston K. Y.

For pupil expansion, the APX dilator required the highest force (41.22 mN), followed by iris hooks (40.82 mN) and the Malyugin ring (18.56 mN).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study predicted that current pupil expanders exert significantly higher amount of stresses and forces than required during pupil expansion. Our work may serve as a guide for the development and design of next-generation pupil expanders.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1523430000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03720-z</link><unread>True</unread><title>Somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1 cause melorheostosis</title><engagement>183</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03720-z</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162b3f688d4:418c61:7d6c1c1c</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03720-z</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/bH20U-3w7Go/s41467-018-03720-z</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>66138a68</fingerprint><author><name>Heeseog Kang</name></author><crawled>1523437701332</crawled><engagementRate>8.32</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Somatic activating mutations in &lt;i&gt;MAP2K1&lt;/i&gt; cause melorheostosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somatic activating mutations in &amp;lt;i&gt;MAP2K1&amp;lt;/i&gt; cause melorheostosis, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03720-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03720-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Melorheostosis is characterized by bone overgrowth and associated with pain and functional impairment.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;This study was designed to assess the mechanical properties of two calcium carbonate tempers, limestone and burnt shell. These tempers have been previously compared, in separate studies, to silicate-based grit or sand temper and, relative to the latter, are assumed to possess similar mechanical properties. However, their simultaneous use at the Morrison Village site begs the question: do these two calcium carbonate tempers indeed possess similar mechanical properties? In order to assess their performance characteristics, a side-by-side controlled experimental test was conducted to determine the degree of similarity in providing increased vessel strength and toughness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Standardized ceramic test samples were systematically prepared via a set, explicit protocol. An Instron Series IX universal testing machine configured with a four-point flexural test jig was used to perform a flexural strength test of the test samples. The Instron load and deflection data were used to calculate three values related to mechanical performance: &lt;i&gt;peak load&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;modulus of rupture&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;modulus of elasticity&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All four comparative tests clearly show substantial differences in &lt;i&gt;peak load&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;modulus of rupture&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;modulus of elasticity&lt;/i&gt;. These differences are statistically significant for each performance attribute in every iteration of the experiment and as indicated by Mann-Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; Tests.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results do not support the hypothesis that limestone and burnt shell offer the same performance characteristics. These results have implications for our understanding of prehistoric human selection of temper and the evolution of ceramic technology. Although both carbonate-based tempers are currently thought to offer the same benefits during the initial phase of pottery production, their contrasting post firing properties would have provided distinct benefits in different contexts. Future assessments of the Morrison Village ceramic assemblage should focus on residue analysis, or other functional indicators, to support or falsify this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michelle Rae Bebber, Linda B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Dietary diversity scores (DDS) are considered as metrics for monitoring the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, but they need to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine two DDS, the Food Groups Index (FGI), and the Minimum Dietary Diversity-Women (MDD-W), alongside two dietary quality scores, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) and the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS), with risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs).&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The analysis included 21,312 (GDM) and 19,917 (HDPs) singleton births reported in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort (1991–2001), among women without major chronic disease or GDM/HDPs. Scores were derived using prepregnancy diet collected by a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable models were utilized to calculate relative risks (RR) and confidence intervals (95%CIs).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Incident GDM (n = 916) and HDPs (n = 1,421) were reported. The MDD-W and FGI were not associated with risk of GDM or HDPs, but the AHEI-2010 and PDQS were associated with a lower risk of GDM and marginally lower risk of HDP. The RR’s of GDM comparing the highest vs. lowest quintiles were 1.00 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.27; p-trend = 0.82) for MDD-W, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.22; p-trend = 0.88) for FGI, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.81; p-trend &amp;lt;0.0001) for the AHEI-2010 and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.54, 0.86; p-trend = 0.003) for the PDQS. Similarly, the RR’s of HDPs were 0.92 (95%CI: 0.75, 1.12, p-trend = 0.94) for MDD-W, 0.97 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.17; p-trend = 0.83) for FGI, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.02; p-trend = 0.07) for AHEI-2010 and 0.89 (95%CI: 0.74, 1.09; p-trend = 0.07) for PDQS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MDD-W and FGI did not predict the risk of GDM and HDPs. These DDS should not be widely used as metrics for achieving dietary goals in their present form. The Prime Diet Quality Score warrants further testing as a promising measure of a sustainable and healthy diet on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Selma Gicevic, Audrey J.

The Prime Diet Quality Score warrants further testing as a promising measure of a sustainable and healthy diet on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521234000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194193</canonicalUrl><updated>1521234000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194193</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849dc:34f43e70</id><title>Clinical management and outcomes of patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome pulmonary fibrosis evaluated for lung transplantation</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194193</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>d4eb2434</fingerprint><author><name>Souheil El-Chemaly</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194193</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Souheil El-Chemaly, Kevin J.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, fatal manifestation of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS). Some patients with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis undergo lung transplantation despite their disease-associated bleeding tendency; others die while awaiting donor organs. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical management and outcomes of a cohort with advanced HPS pulmonary fibrosis who were evaluated for lung transplantation. Six patients with HPS-1 pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and one of two regional lung transplant centers. Their median age was 41.5 years pre-transplant. Three of six patients died without receiving a lung transplant. One of these was referred with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis and died before a donor organ became available, and donor organs were not identified for two other patients sensitized from prior blood product transfusions. Three of six patients received bilateral lung transplants; they did not have a history of excessive bleeding. One patient received peri-operative desmopressin, one was transfused with intra-operative platelets, and one received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intra-operative prothrombin complex concentrate, platelet transfusion, and desmopressin. One transplant recipient experienced acute rejection that responded to pulsed steroids. No evidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction or recurrence of HPS pulmonary fibrosis was detected up to 6 years post-transplant in these three lung transplant recipients. In conclusion, lung transplantation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are viable options for patients with HPS pulmonary fibrosis. Alloimmunization in HPS patients is an important and potentially preventable barrier to lung transplantation; interventions to limit alloimmunization should be implemented in HPS patients at risk of pulmonary fibrosis to optimize their candidacy for future lung transplants.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Souheil El-Chemaly, Kevin J.

Light and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition are among the important environmental factors influencing plant growth and forest regeneration. We used &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt;, a dominant broadleaf tree species native to the deciduous forests of Northern China, to study the combined effects of light exposure and N addition on leaf physiology and individual plant growth. In the greenhouse, we exposed &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt; seedlings to one of two light conditions (8% and 80% of full irradiation) and one of three N treatments (0, 6, and 12 g N m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). After 87 d, we observed that nitrogen deposition had no significant effects on the seedlings regardless of light exposure. In addition, shade significantly reduced plant height, basal diameter, leaf number, total biomass, gas exchange capacity, and carbohydrate content. In contrast, however, shade significantly increased the amount of photosynthetic pigment, above-ground biomass allocation, and specific leaf area. There was also a hierarchical plasticity among the different seedling characteristics. Compared to traits of growth, biomass, biomass allocation and leaf morphology, the leaf physiology, including photosynthetic pigment, gas exchange, carbohydrate, and PUNE, is more sensitive to light conditions. Among the biomass allocation parameters, the leaf and root mass ratios had a relatively low phenotypic plasticity. The seedlings had high foliar physiological plasticity under various light conditions. Nevertheless, we recommend high irradiance to maintain vigorous seedling growth and, in turn, promote the restoration and reconstruction of vegetation.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mingyan Li, Weihua Guo, Ning Du, Zhenwei Xu, Xiao Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records—including SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—of consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI. SWAN- and DWI-based mASPECTSs were calculated, and correlations between DWI-SWAN mismatches with final infarct lesions or clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 35 patients included in this study, we confirmed cardioembolic stroke in 26, atherothrombotic stroke in 4, and unknown stroke etiology in 5. Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient&apos;s age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization. Assessment of ischemic lesions from the venous side appears to be useful for considering the etiology and revascularization therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susumu Yamaguchi, Nobutaka Horie, Minoru Morikawa, Yohei Tateishi, Takeshi Hiu, Yoichi Morofuji, Tsuyoshi Izumo, Kentaro Hayashi, Takayuki Matsuo&lt;/p&gt;

The abortifacient Mifepristone (RU486) has proven to be a safe, effective, acceptable option for millions of women seeking abortion during the first and second trimester of pregnancy although its precise mechanism of action is not well understood. The main objective of this study was to investigate the impact of low dose Mifepristone administration on placental Galectin-9 (Gal-9) expression, as well as its effect on the cell surface expression of Gal-9, TIM-3 and CD107a molecules by different T and NK cell subsets. A model of Mifepristone-induced immunological changes was established in syngeneic pregnant BALB/c mice. RU486-induced alteration in placental Gal-9 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. For immunophenotypic analysis, mid-pregnancy decidual lymphocytes and peripheral mononuclear cells were obtained from Mifepristone treated and control mice at the 14.5 day of gestation. TIM-3 and Gal-9 expression by peripheral and decidual immune cells were examined by flow cytometry. Our results revealed a dramatically decreased intracellular Gal-9 expression in the spongiotrophoblast layer of the haemochorial placenta in Mifepristone treated pregnant mice. Although low dose RU486 treatment did not cause considerable change in the phenotypic distribution of decidual and peripheral immune cells, it altered the Gal-9 and TIM-3 expression by different NK and T cell subsets. In addition, the treatment significantly decreased the CD107a expression by decidual TIM-3+ NK cells, but increased its expression by decidual NKT cell compared to the peripheral counterparts. These findings suggest that low dose Mifepristone administration might induce immune alterations in both progesterone dependent and independent way.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Adrienn Lajko, Matyas Meggyes, Beata Polgar, Laszlo Szereday&lt;/p&gt;

The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC provides an efficient platform for profiling DNA methylation in humans at over 850,000 CpGs. Model organisms such as mice do not currently benefit from an equivalent array. Here we used this array to measure DNA methylation in mice. We defined probes targeting conserved regions and performed differential methylation analysis and compared between the array-based assay and affinity-based DNA sequencing of methyl-CpGs (MBD-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Mouse samples consisted of 11 liver DNA from two strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), that varied widely in age. Linear regression was applied to detect differential methylation. In total, 13,665 probes (1.6% of total probes) aligned to conserved CpGs. Beta-values (β-value) for these probes showed a distribution similar to that in humans. Overall, there was high concordance in methylation signal between the EPIC array and MBD-seq (Pearson correlation r = 0.70, p-value &amp;lt; 0.0001). However, the EPIC probes had higher quantitative sensitivity at CpGs that are hypo- (β-value &amp;lt; 0.3) or hypermethylated (β-value &gt; 0.7). In terms of differential methylation, no EPIC probe detected a significant difference between age groups at a Benjamini-Hochberg threshold of 10%, and the MBD-seq performed better at detecting age-dependent change in methylation. However, the top most significant probe for age (cg13269407; uncorrected p-value = 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) is part of the clock CpGs used to estimate the human epigenetic age. For strain, 219 EPIC probes detected significant differential methylation (FDR cutoff 10%) with ~80% CpGs associated with higher methylation in D2. This higher methylation profile in D2 compared to B6 was also replicated by the MBD-seq data. To summarize, we found only a small subset of EPIC probes that target conserved sites. However, for this small subset the array provides a reliable assay of DNA methylation and can be effectively used to measure differential methylation in mice.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hemant Gujar, Jane W.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the retention and discontinuation reasons of seven biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in a real-world setting of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 1,037 treatment courses with bDMARDs from 2009 to 2016 [female, 81.8%; baseline age, 59.6 y; disease duration 7.8 y; rheumatoid factor positivity 81.5%; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), 4.4; concomitant prednisolone 43.5% and methotrexate 68.6%; Bio-naïve, 57.1%; abatacept (ABT), 21.3%; tocilizumab (TCZ), 20.7%; golimumab (GLM), 16.9%; etanercept (ETN), 13.6%; adalimumab (ADA), 11.1%; infliximab (IFX), 8.5%; certolizumab pegol (CZP), 7.9%] were included in this multi-center, retrospective study. Drug retention and discontinuation reasons at 36 months were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and adjusted by potent confounders using Cox proportional hazards modeling. As a result, 455 treatment courses (43.9%) were stopped, with 217 (20.9%) stopping due to inefficacy, 113 (10.9%) due to non-toxic reasons, 86 (8.3%) due to toxic adverse events, and 39 (3.8%) due to remission. Drug retention rates in the adjusted model were as follows: total retention (ABT, 60.7%; ADA, 32.7%; CZP, 43.3%; ETN, 51.9%; GLM, 45.4%; IFX, 31.1%; and TCZ, 59.2%; P &amp;lt; 0.001); inefficacy (ABT, 81.4%; ADA, 65.7%; CZP, 60.7%; ETN, 71.3%; GLM, 68.5%; IFX, 65.0%; and TCZ, 81.4%; P = 0.015), toxic adverse events (ABT, 89.8%; ADA, 80.5%; CZP, 83.9%; ETN, 89.2%; GLM, 85.5%; IFX, 75.6%; and TCZ, 77.2%; P = 0.50), and remission (ABT, 95.5%; ADA, 88.1%; CZP, 91.1%; ETN, 97.5%; GLM, 94.7%; IFX, 86.4%; and TCZ, 98.4%; P &amp;lt; 0.001).

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection. NHBA cleavage may occur at different stages of the infection, and it likely has a different role depending on the environment the bacterium is interacting with.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Di Fede, Massimiliano Biagini, Elena Cartocci, Carlo Parillo, Alessandra Greco, Manuele Martinelli, Sara Marchi, Alfredo Pezzicoli, Isabel Delany, Silvia Rossi Paccani&lt;/p&gt;

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have anti-inflammatory effects and were considered useful for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, several studies suggested that n-3 PUFAs attenuated arthritis in animal model and human, however the mechanism is still unclear. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly produced by T helper 17 (Th17) cells which cause tissue inflammation and bone erosion leading to joint destruction. In contrast, regulatory T (Treg) cells down-regulate various immune responses by suppression of naïve T cells. The imbalance between Th17 cells and Tregs cell is important for the pathogenesis of RA. Here, we investigated whether n-3 PUFAs attenuate arthritis in collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model. We used fat-1 transgenic mice expressing the Caenorhabditis elegans fat-1 gene encoding an n-3 fatty acid desaturase that converts n-6 to n-3 fatty acids, leading to abundant n-3 fatty acids without the need of a dietary n-3 supply. Clinical arthritis score was significantly attenuated in fat-1 mice compared to wild type (WT) mice on day 7 (1.6±1.8, p = 0.012) and day 9 (1.5±1.6, p = 0.003). Ankle thickness also decreased significantly in fat-1 mice compared to WT mice (1.82±0.11, p = 0.008). The pathologic finding showed that inflammatory cell infiltration and bone destruction were reduced in fat-1 mice compared to WT. The expression levels of IL-17 and related cytokines including IL-6 and IL-23 decreased in the spleen and ankle joint tissue of fat-1 mice compared to WT mice. Furthermore, Treg cells were expanded in the spleen of fat-1 mice and Treg cell differentiation was significantly higher in fat-1 mice than in wild type (p = 0.038). These data suggest that n-3 PUFAs could attenuate arthritis through increasing the expression of FoxP3 and the differentiation of Treg, while reducing IL-17 production. Therefore, dietary supplementation of n-3 PUFAs could have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of RA.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Young Kim, Kyu Lim, Kyung Hee Kim, Jin Hyun Kim, Jin Sun Choi, Seung-Cheol Shim&lt;/p&gt;

Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycotoxin produced by &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species, which is one of the main animal feed contaminants causing reproductive disorders in livestock. The aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic characteristics and ZEN removal ability of a &lt;i&gt;Bacillus licheniformis&lt;/i&gt; strain CK1. The probiotic properties, including acidic tolerance, bile salt tolerance, adherence capability, and anti-pathogenic activities of CK1 were evaluated. CK1 survived after incubation at pH 2.0 or 3.0 for 3 h, grew well in LB broth containing 0.3% oxgall, possessed adherence capability to Caco-2 cells, and inhibited the growth of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 and &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. The ZEN removal ability of CK1 was compared with a mineral mycotoxin-adsorbing agent, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), and a well-characterized biological mycotoxin-adsorbing agent, &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt; GG (LGG). At 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) containing 5 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of ZEN, the ZEN removal percentage of CK1 was 73.0%, which was significantly higher than that of HSCAS and LGG (45.9% and 48.4%, respectively). In the pH range of 2.5–8.0, CK1 removed up to 65% of ZEN. At temperatures between 4 and 42°C, CK1 removed more than 75% of ZEN. In the adsorption stability analysis, the amounts of ZEN removed by CK1 was over 30% even after five consecutive rounds of washing procedures. These findings demonstrated that CK1 displayed probiotic characteristics and removed ZEN effectively. Therefore, CK1 has a great potential for the development of feed additive to remove ZEN.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tsui-Chun Hsu, Ping-Jung Yi, Ting-Yu Lee, Je-Ruei Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Some epidemiological studies indicate that the use of mobile phones causes cancer in humans (in particular glioblastomas). It is known that DNA damage plays a key role in malignant transformation; therefore, we investigated the impact of the UMTS signal which is widely used in mobile telecommunications, on DNA stability in ten different human cell lines (six brain derived cell lines, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, liver and buccal tissue derived cells) under conditions relevant for users (SAR 0.25 to 1.00 W/kg). We found no evidence for induction of damage in single cell gel electrophoresis assays when the cells were cultivated with serum. However, clear positive effects were seen in a p53 proficient glioblastoma line (U87) when the cells were grown under serum free conditions, while no effects were found in p53 deficient glioblastoma cells (U251). Further experiments showed that the damage disappears rapidly in U87 and that exposure induced nucleotide excision repair (NER) and does not cause double strand breaks (DSBs). The observation of NER induction is supported by results of a proteome analysis indicating that several proteins involved in NER are up-regulated after exposure to UMTS; additionally, we found limited evidence for the activation of the γ-interferon pathway. The present findings show that the signal causes transient genetic instability in glioma derived cells and activates cellular defense systems.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Halh Al-Serori, Franziska Ferk, Michael Kundi, Andrea Bileck, Christopher Gerner, Miroslav Mišík, Armen Nersesyan, Monika Waldherr, Manuel Murbach, Tamara T.

It is known that DNA damage plays a key role in malignant transformation; therefore, we investigated the impact of the UMTS signal which is widely used in mobile telecommunications, on DNA stability in ten different human cell lines (six brain derived cell lines, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, liver and buccal tissue derived cells) under conditions relevant for users (SAR 0.25 to 1.00 W/kg). We found no evidence for induction of damage in single cell gel electrophoresis assays when the cells were cultivated with serum. However, clear positive effects were seen in a p53 proficient glioblastoma line (U87) when the cells were grown under serum free conditions, while no effects were found in p53 deficient glioblastoma cells (U251). Further experiments showed that the damage disappears rapidly in U87 and that exposure induced nucleotide excision repair (NER) and does not cause double strand breaks (DSBs). The observation of NER induction is supported by results of a proteome analysis indicating that several proteins involved in NER are up-regulated after exposure to UMTS; additionally, we found limited evidence for the activation of the γ-interferon pathway. The present findings show that the signal causes transient genetic instability in glioma derived cells and activates cellular defense systems.</content></content></item><item><published>1521666000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194320</canonicalUrl><updated>1521666000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194320</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e4:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Disorder strength measured by quantitative phase imaging as intrinsic cancer marker in fixed tissue biopsies</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194320</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ced6e04e</fingerprint><author><name>Masanori Takabayashi</name></author><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194320</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masanori Takabayashi, Hassaan Majeed, Andre Kajdacsy-Balla, Gabriel Popescu&lt;/p&gt;
Tissue refractive index provides important information about morphology at the nanoscale. Since the malignant transformation involves both intra- and inter-cellular changes in the refractive index map, the tissue disorder measurement can be used to extract important diagnosis information. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) provides a practical means of extracting this information as it maps the optical path-length difference (OPD) across a tissue sample with sub-wavelength sensitivity. In this work, we employ QPI to compare the tissue disorder strength between benign and malignant breast tissue histology samples. Our results show that disease progression is marked by a significant &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; in the disorder strength. Since our imaging system can be added as an upgrading module to an existing microscope, we anticipate that it can be integrated easily in the pathology work flow.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Masanori Takabayashi, Hassaan Majeed, Andre Kajdacsy-Balla, Gabriel Popescu&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, alignment-free methods based on kmer composition have proven their ability to explore the accessory genome. However, they lead to redundant descriptions and results which are hard to interpret. Methods: Here, we introduce DBGWAS, an extended kmer-based GWAS method producing interpretable genetic variants associated with phenotypes. Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes identified by the association model into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is fast, alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. It produces annotated subgraphs representing local polymorphisms as well as mobile genetic elements (MGE) and offers a graphical framework to interpret GWAS results. Results: We validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - along with their MGE context. It also enabled us to formulate new hypotheses involving genetic variants not yet described in the antibiotic resistance literature. Conclusion: Our novel method proved its efficiency to retrieve any type of phenotype-associated genetic variant without prior knowledge. All experiments were computed in less than two hours and reported a compact set of meaningful subgraphs, thereby outperforming other GWAS approaches and facilitating the interpretation of the results.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atypical meningiomas are common central nervous system neoplasms with high recurrence rate and poorer prognosis compared to their grade I counterparts. Surgical excision and radiotherapy remains the mainstay therapy but medical treatments are limited. We explore new drug candidates using computational drug repurposing based on the gene expression signature of atypical meningioma tissue with subsequent analysis of drug-generated expression profiles. We further explore possible mechanisms of action for the identified drug candidates using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted gene expression profiles for atypical meningiomas (12 samples) and normal meningeal tissue (4 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which were then used to generate a gene signature comprising of 281 differentially expressed genes. Drug candidates were explored using both the Board Institute Connectivity Map (cmap) and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). Functional analysis of significant differential gene expression for drug candidates was performed with IPA.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using our integrated approach, we identified multiple, already licensed, drug candidates such as emetine, verteporfin, phenoxybenzamine and trazodone. Analysis with IPA revealed that these drugs target signal cascades potentially relevant in pathogenesis of meningiomas, particular examples are the effect on ERK by trazodone, MAP kinases by emetine, and YAP-1 protein by verteporfin.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Gene expression profiling and use of drug expression profiles have yielded several plausible drug candidates for treating atypical meningioma, some of which have already been suggested by preceding studies. Although our analyses suggested multiple anti-tumour mechanisms for these drugs, further &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies are required for validation.&lt;/p&gt; Importance of the study &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge this is the first study which combines relatively new, yet established computational techniques to identify additional treatments for a difficult to manage cerebral neoplasm.

Prefrontal anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a potential approach to improve inhibitory control performance. The functional consequences of tDCS during inhibition tasks remain, however, largely unresolved. We addressed this question by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded while participants completed a Go/NoGo task after right-lateralized prefrontal anodal tDCS with a crossover, sham-controlled, double-blind experimental design. We replicated previous evidence for an absence of offline effect of anodal stimulation on Go/NoGo performance. The fMRI results revealed a larger increase in right ventrolateral prefrontal activity for Go than NoGo trials in the anodal than sham condition. This pattern suggests that tDCS-induced increases in cortical excitability have larger effects on fMRI activity in regions with a lower task-related engagement. This was the case for the right prefrontal cortex in the Go condition in our task because while reactive inhibition was not engaged during execution trials, the unpredictability of the demand for inhibitory control still incited an engagement of proactive inhibition. Exploratory analyses further revealed that right prefrontal stimulation interacted with task-related functional demands in the supplementary motor area and the thalamus. Our collective results emphasize the dependency of offline tDCS functional effects on the task-related engagement of the stimulated areas and suggest that this factor might partly account for the discrepancies in the functional effects of tDCS observed in previous studies.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Etienne Sallard, Michael Mouthon, Michael De Pretto, Lucas Spierer&lt;/p&gt;

Delivery of recombinant proteins to therapeutic cells is limited by a lack of efficient methods. This hinders the use of transcription factors or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) ribonucleoproteins to develop cell therapies. Here, we report a soluble peptide designed for the direct delivery of proteins to mammalian cells including human stem cells, hard-to-modify primary natural killer (NK) cells, and cancer cell models. This peptide is composed of a 6x histidine-rich domain fused to the endosomolytic peptide CM18 and the cell penetrating peptide PTD4. A less than two-minute co-incubation of 6His-CM18-PTD4 peptide with spCas9 and/or asCpf1 CRISPR ribonucleoproteins achieves robust gene editing. The same procedure, co-incubating with the transcription factor HoxB4, achieves transcriptional regulation. The broad applicability and flexibility of this DNA- and chemical-free method across different cell types, particularly hard-to-transfect cells, opens the way for a direct use of proteins for biomedical research and cell therapy manufacturing.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Del’Guidice, Jean-Pascal Lepetit-Stoffaes, Louis-Jean Bordeleau, Joannie Roberge, Vanessa Théberge, Coraline Lauvaux, Xavier Barbeau, Jessica Trottier, Vibhuti Dave, Denis-Claude Roy, Bruno Gaillet, Alain Garnier, David Guay&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the cost-effectiveness of the elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) regimen in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;This study uses a health economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating previously untreated and treatment experienced chronic hepatitis C patients who have severe and end stage renal disease with the elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen versus no treatment in the French context. The lifetime homogeneous markovian model comprises of forty combined health states including hepatitis C virus and chronic kidney disease. The model parameters were from a multicentre randomized controlled trial, ANRS CO22 HEPATHER French cohort and literature. 1000 Monte Carlo simulations of patient health states for each treatment strategy are used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 95% confidence intervals calculations. The results were expressed in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;The mean age of patients in the HEPATHER French cohort was 59.6 years and 56% of them were men. 22.3% of patients had a F0 fibrosis stage (no fibrosis), 24.1% a F1 stage (portal fibrosis without septa), 7.1% a F2 stage (portal fibrosis with few septa), 21.4% a F3 stage (numerous septa without fibrosis) and 25% a F4 fibrosis stage (compensated cirrhosis). Among these HCV genotype 1 patients, 30% had severe renal impairment stage 4, 33% had a severe renal insufficiency stage 5 and 37% had terminal severe renal impairment stage 5 treated by dialysis.&lt;/p&gt; Intervention &lt;p&gt;Fixed-dose combination of direct-acting antiviral agents elbasvir and grazoprevir compared to no-treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;EBR/GZR increased the number of life years (6.3 years) compared to no treatment (5.1 years) on a lifetime horizon. The total number of QALYs was higher for the new treatment because of better utility on health conditions (6.2 versus 3.7 QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was of €15,212 per QALY gained for the base case analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This cost-utility model is an innovative approach that simultaneously looks at the disease evolution of chronic hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease. EBR/GZR without interferon and ribavirin, produced the greatest benefit in terms of life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in treatment-naïve or experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and stage 4–5 chronic kidney disease including dialysis patients. Based on shape of the acceptability curve, EBR/GZR can be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay of €20,000 /QALY for patients with renal insufficiency with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Franck Maunoury, Aurore Clément, Chizoba Nwankwo, Laurie Levy-Bachelot, Armand Abergel, Vincent Di Martino, Eric Thervet, Isabelle Durand-Zaleski&lt;/p&gt;

Based on shape of the acceptability curve, EBR/GZR can be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay of €20,000 /QALY for patients with renal insufficiency with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521010800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03179-4/d41586-018-03179-4_15530430.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16225dcf94e:521b50:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Dwarf planet boasts icy winters and spring thaws</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03179-4</originId><unread>False</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03179-4</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>bb305e58</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1521053661518</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03179-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dwarf planet boasts icy winters and spring thaws&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dwarf planet boasts icy winters and spring thaws, Published online: 14 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03179-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03179-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The seasons drive aquatic activity on Ceres.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dwarf planet boasts icy winters and spring thaws&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dwarf planet boasts icy winters and spring thaws, Published online: 14 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03179-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03179-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The seasons drive aquatic activity on Ceres.</content></content></item><item><published>1522998000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>Optimal diversification strategies in the networks of related products and of related research areas</title><engagement>407</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03740-9</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1629a4a2515:1089ef:7c9981b6</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03740-9</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/pprTwxqfhBc/s41467-018-03740-9</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>11fac7eb</fingerprint><author><name>Aamena Alshamsi</name></author><crawled>1523006973205</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03740-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optimal diversification strategies in the networks of related products and of related research areas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimal diversification strategies in the networks of related products and of related research areas, Published online: 06 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03740-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03740-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The probability that a region will develop a particular research activity increases with the number of similar activities in neighboring regions.

Black locust (&lt;i&gt;Robinia pseudoacacia&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an easy to raise, fast growing, medium-sized deciduous tree species highly tolerant to harsh eco-conditions, i.e., drought and harsh winters, and it is widely adaptable to sandy, loamy, and marshy soils. The basis for this adaptability remains to be investigated at the transcriptomic level using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Selection of a reliable gene for the normalization of qPCR data is important for obtaining accurate results in gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify an appropriate reference gene from 12 candidate genes for gene expression analysis in black locust exposed to various stressors such as abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and varying temperatures. In GeNorm and NormFinder analyses, &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; (actin) and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene expression were the most stable in all conditions except heat stress, but in BestKeeper analysis, &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;helicase&lt;/i&gt; gene expression were the most stable under NaCl and heat stress. In contrast, &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; were highest under abscisic acid (ABA), &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;βTUB&lt;/i&gt; (beta tubulin) under cold stress, and &lt;i&gt;helicase&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EF1α&lt;/i&gt; (elongation factor 1 alpha) under PEG stress. We found that the most stable reference gene combination for all conditions was &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, the expression pattern of &lt;i&gt;NAC2&lt;/i&gt; (a transcription factor) and &lt;i&gt;BGL2&lt;/i&gt; in different tissues and under different stress conditions was analyzed relative to &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;UBQ&lt;/i&gt; (ubiquitin) the least stably expressed gene. &lt;i&gt;NAC2 and BGL2&lt;/i&gt; both had highest expression in flowers and pods under ABA stress at 48h.

Various models have been proposed to describe the durations of each phase, including a two-state model with fixed S-G2-M duration and random G1 duration1,2; a &amp;quot;stretched&amp;quot; model in which phase durations are proportional3; and an inheritance model in which sister cells show correlated phase durations2,4.

Here, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to quantify the durations of G1, S, G2, and M phases for thousands of individual cells from three human cell lines. We found no evidence of correlation between any pair of phase durations. Instead, each phase followed an Erlang distribution with a characteristic rate and number of steps. These observations suggest that each cell cycle phase is memoryless with respect to previous phase durations. We challenged this model by perturbing the durations of specific phases through oncogene activation, inhibition of DNA synthesis, reduced temperature, and DNA damage. Phase durations remained uncoupled in individual cells despite large changes in durations in cell populations. To explain this behavior, we propose a mathematical model in which the independence of cell-cycle phase durations arises from a large number of molecular factors that each exerts a minor influence on the rate of cell-cycle progression. The model predicts that it is possible to force correlations between phases by making large perturbations to a single factor that contributes to more than one phase duration, which we confirmed experimentally by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). We further report that phases can show coupling under certain dysfunctional states such as in a transformed cell line with defective cell cycle checkpoints. This quantitative model of cell cycle progression explains the paradoxical observation that phase durations are both inherited and independent and suggests how cell cycle progression may be altered in disease states.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The cell cycle is canonically described as a series of 4 phases: G1 (gap phase 1), S (DNA synthesis), G2 (gap phase 2), and M (mitosis).

This quantitative model of cell cycle progression explains the paradoxical observation that phase durations are both inherited and independent and suggests how cell cycle progression may be altered in disease states.</content></content></item><item><published>1520924400000</published><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03124-5/d41586-018-03124-5_15525892.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height><width>1024</width></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1621f7febd6:450a3f:34f43e70</id><title>The housing trend feeding wildfires’ flames</title><engagement>10</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03124-5</originId><unread>False</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03124-5</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>33e481e6</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1520946899926</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03124-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The housing trend feeding wildfires’ flames&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing trend feeding wildfires’ flames, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03124-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03124-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The hot market for homes close to nature is raising the threat from wildfires.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The housing trend feeding wildfires’ flames&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing trend feeding wildfires’ flames, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03124-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03124-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The hot market for homes close to nature is raising the threat from wildfires.</content></content></item><item><published>1521493200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194338</canonicalUrl><updated>1521493200000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194338</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f5:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Antenatal depressive symptoms in Jamaica associated with limited perceived partner and other social support: A cross-sectional study</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194338</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>9a39ecbf</fingerprint><author><name>Omotayo Bernard</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194338</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Omotayo Bernard, Roger C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Antenatal depression is associated with adverse maternal and infant well-being. However, compared to postpartum depression, it has been less frequently explored globally or in Jamaica. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, antenatal depressive symptoms among Jamaican women in order to inform policy and build interventions that could improve their management and reduce their negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This secondary analysis of data from the second Jamaican Birth Cohort Study (JA-Kids Birth Cohort) included 3,517 women enrolled during pregnancy. Information was extracted from interviewer-administered questionnaires which recorded social, demographic, medical and obstetric information during pregnancy. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) was used to screen for depression, with scores ≥13 considered indicative of a high likelihood of depression. Bivariate analysis examined associations between depressive symptoms and: age, income, financial difficulties, perceived social support, perceived partner infidelity, previous child-bearing unions and children with the current partner. Obstetric factors were also explored and included gravidity, prior adverse pregnancy outcome and complications from previous pregnancies. Variables that predicted the likelihood of depression based on an EPDS cut score of 13 were evaluated using logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One in five participants (19.6%; 95% CI 18.3–20.9%) had a high likelihood of antenatal depression (EPDS ≥13). Significant predictors of high depressive symptom severity included four indicators of poor perceived social and partner support [ORs (95% CI) ranged from: 1.61 (1.07–2.43); p = 0.024 to 3.14(1.69–5.84); p&amp;lt; 0.001], perceived partner infidelity [1.86 (1.36, 2.54); p&amp;lt;0.001], exposure to violence [2.36 (1.66–3.38); p&amp;lt;0.001] and financial difficulties [1.39 (1.07, 1.80); p = 0.013].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Women’s perceived social and partner support were strongly associated with depressive symptom severity. Within the Jamaican cultural context of unstable reproductive unions, efforts are needed to involve fathers in the antenatal care process to strategically improve the psychological well-being of new mothers which may positively influence long term developmental outcomes for their babies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Omotayo Bernard, Roger C.

The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) consist of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and chemical additives for flavoring. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, and while some have been tested for toxicity in the laboratory, most have not. Here, we developed a 3-phase, 384-well, plate-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to rapidly triage and validate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids. Our data demonstrated that the PG/VG vehicle adversely affected cell viability and that a large number of e-liquids were more toxic than PG/VG. We also performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on all tested e-liquids. Subsequent nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that e-liquids are an extremely heterogeneous group. Furthermore, these data indicated that (i) the more chemicals contained in an e-liquid, the more toxic it was likely to be and (ii) the presence of vanillin was associated with higher toxicity values. Further analysis of common constituents by electron ionization revealed that the concentration of cinnamaldehyde and vanillin, but not triacetin, correlated with toxicity. We have also developed a publicly available searchable website (www.eliquidinfo.org). Given the large numbers of available e-liquids, this website will serve as a resource to facilitate dissemination of this information. Our data suggest that an HTS approach to evaluate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids is feasible. Such an approach may serve as a roadmap to enable bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better regulate e-liquid composition.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Djo1Z76O3OU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by M.

Such an approach may serve as a roadmap to enable bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better regulate e-liquid composition.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Djo1Z76O3OU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/Djo1Z76O3OU/article</href></item></alternate></item><item><published>1523554636000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Reforestation to enhance the soil carbon sink</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:fecec8:34f43e70</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-e?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/167.5.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/167-e?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>53e37b7c</fingerprint><author><name>Sugden, A.

Niosomes are used in studies for drug delivery or gene transfer. However, their physical properties and features relative to liposomes are not well documented. To characterize and more rationally optimize niosome formulations, the properties of these vesicle systems are compared to those of liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids plus cholesterol. Niosomes are highly stable and only slightly more leaky than liposomes as assayed by calcein leakage; the permeability for ions (KCl) is higher than that of liposomes. Contrary to liposomes, the size of niosomes decreases substantially upon freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent thawing, as shown by cryo-EM and dynamic light scattering. The packing of niosomal membranes was determined by laurdan fluorescence and is slightly lower than that of liposomes. We did not succeed in the functional reconstitution of the L-arginine/L-ornithine antiporter ArcD2 in niosomes, which we attribute to the non-ionic nature of the surfactants. The antimicrobial peptides alamethicin and melittin act similarly on niosomes and liposomes composed of unsaturated components, whereas both niosomes and liposomes are unaffected when saturated amphiphiles are used. In conclusion, in terms of stability and permeability for drug-size molecules niosomes are comparable to liposomes and they may offer an excellent, inexpensive alternative for delivery purposes.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rianne Bartelds, Mohammad Hadi Nematollahi, Tjeerd Pols, Marc C.

Sinkholes are a well-known geologic hazard but their past occurrence, useful for subsidence risk prediction, is difficult to define, especially for ancient historic times. Consequently, our knowledge about Holocene carbonate landscapes is often limited. A multidisciplinary study of Trieste Karst (Italy), close to early Roman military fortifications, led to the identification of possible ancient road tracks, cut by at least one sinkhole. Electrical Resistivity Tomography through the sinkhole has suggested the presence of a cave below its bottom, possibly responsible of the sinkhole formation, while Ground Penetrating Radar has detected no tectonic disturbances underneath the tracks. Additionally, archaeological surveys led to the discovery of over 200 Roman shoe hobnails within or close to the investigated route. According to these data, the tracks are interpreted as the remains of a main Roman road, whose itinerary has been reconstructed for more than 4 km together with other elements of ancient landscape. Our results provide the first known evidence of a Roman main road swallowed by sinkholes and suggest that Holocene karst landscapes could be much different from what previously believed. In fact, sinkholes visible nowadays in the investigated region could have been flat areas filled by sediments up to the Roman time.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Bernardini, Giacomo Vinci, Emanuele Forte, Stefano Furlani, Michele Pipan, Sara Biolchi, Angelo De Min, Andrea Fragiacomo, Roberto Micheli, Paola Ventura, Claudio Tuniz&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical significance of the laboratory-based phenomenon of clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness and platelet reactivity associated with acute myocardial infarction, despite chronic clopidogrel therapy, is largely unknown. We aimed to determine platelet reactivity and clinical and angiographic features in 29 consecutive patients sustaining an acute myocardial infarction despite chronic (≥1 month) clopidogrel therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Platelet reactivity was determined on admission using conventional aggregometry. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 24 hours of admission. Patients were matched with clopidogrel-naïve acute myocardial infarction patients. Clopidogrel-naïve patients received a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose and 75 mg/day thereafter.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 29 study patients, 19 (66%) presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and in 25% the infarction was related to angiographically-proved definite stent thrombosis. Two-thirds of these patients were poor responders to clopidogrel (adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation &gt;50%) and dual antiplatelet poor responsiveness was found in 57% in the chronic clopidogrel therapy group. Compared with clopidogrel-naïve patients, chronic clopidogrel therapy patients were more likely to demonstrate clopidogrel poor responsiveness (66% versus 38%, p = 0.02), to be diabetic (52% versus 33%, p = 0.1) and to have multi-vessel coronary disease (79% versus 55%, p = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients sustaining acute coronary syndrome despite chronic clopidogrel therapy are more likely to exhibit inadequate platelet inhibition with clopidogrel.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ehud Regev, Elad Asher, Paul Fefer, Roy Beigel, Israel Mazin, Shlomi Matetzky, For The Platelets and Thrombosis in Sheba (PLATIS) - Study Group &lt;/p&gt;

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica L.

This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</content></content></item><item><published>1519883267000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://www.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 9, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Koopmans’ theorem in the Hartree-Fock method.

The environmental fates of pharmaceuticals and the effects of crop protection products on non-target species are subjects that are undergoing intense review. Since measuring the concentrations and effects of xenobiotics on all affected species under all conceivable scenarios is not feasible, standard laboratory animals such as rabbits are tested, and the observed adverse effects are translated to focal species for environmental risk assessments. In that respect, mathematical modelling is becoming increasingly important for evaluating the consequences of pesticides in untested scenarios. In particular, physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (PBPK/TK) modelling is a well-established methodology used to predict tissue concentrations based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs and toxicants. In the present work, a rabbit PBPK/TK model is developed and evaluated with data available from the literature. The model predictions include scenarios of both intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) administration of small and large compounds. The presented rabbit PBPK/TK model predicts the pharmacokinetics (Cmax, AUC) of the tested compounds with an average 1.7-fold error. This result indicates a good predictive capacity of the model, which enables its use for risk assessment modelling and simulations.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Panteleimon D.

The spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity pose a great challenge to accurately estimate the carbon flux in global carbon cycling, which has primarily been researched in flatlands versus hillslope ecosystems. On an eroded slope (35°) of the semiarid Loess Plateau, soil respiration, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; at upper and lower slope positions in triplicate from 2014 until 2016, and the soil biochemical and microbial properties were determined. The results showed that soil respiration was significantly greater (by 44.2%) at the lower slope position (2.6 μmol m&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;) than at the upper slope position, as were soil moisture, carbon, nitrogen fractions and root biomass. However, the temperature sensitivity was 13.2% greater at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The soil fungal community changed from being Basidiomycota-dominant at the upper slope position to being Zygomycota-dominant at the lower slope position, corresponding with increased β-D-glucosidase activity at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position. We concluded that soil respiration was enhanced by the greater soil moisture, root biomass, carbon and nitrogen contents at the lower slope position than at the upper slope position. Moreover, the increased soil respiration and decreased temperature sensitivity at the lower slope position were partially due to copiotrophs replacing oligotrophs. Such spatial variations along slopes must be properly accounted for when estimating the carbon budget and feedback of future climate change on hillslope ecosystems.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Qiqi Sun, Rui Wang, Yaxian Hu, Lunguang Yao, Shengli Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Molecular characterization of early hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains rare. Ten out of 78 patients of a hematology/oncology center were found to be HCV RNA positive two to four months after hospitalization. Only two of the ten patients were anti-HCV positive. HCV hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) was amplified in seven patients (including one anti-HCV positive) and analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS). Genetic variants were reconstructed by Shorah and an empirically established 0.5% variant frequency cut-off was implemented. These sequences were compared by phylogenetic and diversity analyses. Ten unrelated blood donors with newly acquired HCV infection detected at the time of donation (HCV RNA positive and anti-HCV negative) served as controls. One to seven HVR1 variants were found in each patient. Sequences intermixed phylogenetically with no evidence of clustering in individual patients. These sequences were more similar to each other (similarity 95.4% to 100.0%) than to those of controls (similarity 64.8% to 82.6%). An identical predominant variant was present in four patients, whereas other closely related variants dominated in the remaining three patients. In five patients the HCV population was limited to a single variant or one predominant variant and minor variants of less than 10% frequency. In conclusion, NGS analysis of a cluster of HCV infections acquired in the hospital setting revealed the presence of low diversity, very closely related variants in all patients, suggesting an early-stage infection with the same virus. NGS combined with phylogenetic analysis and classical epidemiological analysis could help in tracking of HCV outbreaks.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kamila Caraballo Cortes, Magdalena Rosińska, Maciej Janiak, Małgorzata Stępień, Osvaldo Zagordi, Karol Perlejewski, Sylwia Osuch, Agnieszka Pawełczyk, Iwona Bukowska-Ośko, Rafał Płoski, Piotr Grabarczyk, Tomasz Laskus, Marek Radkowski&lt;/p&gt;

Object conceptual processing has been localized to distributed cortical regions that represent specific attributes. A challenging question is how object semantic space is formed. We tested a novel framework of representing semantic space in the pattern of white matter (WM) connections by extending the representational similarity analysis (RSA) to structural lesion pattern and behavioral data in 80 brain-damaged patients. For each WM connection, a neural representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) was computed by first building machine-learning models with the voxel-wise WM lesion patterns as features to predict naming performance of a particular item and then computing the correlation between the predicted naming score and the actual naming score of another item in the testing patients. This correlation was used to build the neural RDM based on the assumption that if the connection pattern contains certain aspects of information shared by the naming processes of these two items, models trained with one item should also predict naming accuracy of the other. Correlating the neural RDM with various cognitive RDMs revealed that neural patterns in several WM connections that connect left occipital/middle temporal regions and anterior temporal regions associated with the object semantic space. Such associations were not attributable to modality-specific attributes (shape, manipulation, color, and motion), to peripheral picture-naming processes (picture visual similarity, phonological similarity), to broad semantic categories, or to the properties of the cortical regions that they connected, which tended to represent multiple modality-specific attributes. That is, the semantic space could be represented through WM connection patterns across cortical regions representing modality-specific attributes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/z8lA2SDocVs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuxing Fang, Xiaosha Wang, Suyu Zhong, Luping Song, Zaizhu Han, Gaolang Gong, Yanchao Bi&lt;/p&gt;

When uptake ratio of only single reaction was allowed to change at a time, the results of computational experiments showed that every essential amino acid had effective ranges for almost all nine types of cancer, while the other uptake reactions rarely had such effective ranges.</content></content></item><item><published>1521234000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005970</originId><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1622ff40c2d:53788f:bdf8aaf1</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005970</href></item></canonical><title>The exclusive effects of chaperonin on the behavior of proteins with 5&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; knot</title><recrawled>1521231665475</recrawled><fingerprint>408f8866</fingerprint><author><name>Yani Zhao</name></author><crawled>1521222945837</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005970</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yani Zhao, Pawel Dabrowski-Tumanski, Szymon Niewieczerzal, Joanna I.

The folding of proteins with a complex knot is still an unresolved question. Based on representative members of Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolases (UCHs) that contain the 5&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot in the native state, we explain how UCHs are able to unfold and refold &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; reversibly within the structure-based model. In particular, we identify two, topologically different folding/unfolding pathways and corroborate our results with experiment, recreating the chevron plot. We show that confinement effect of chaperonin or weak crowding greatly facilitates folding, simultaneously slowing down the unfolding process of UCHs, compared with bulk conditions. Finally, we analyze the existence of knots in the denaturated state of UCHs. The results of the work show that the crowded environment of the cell should have a positive effect on the kinetics of complex knotted proteins, especially when proteins with deeper knots are found in this family.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IQnzANgGzpM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yani Zhao, Pawel Dabrowski-Tumanski, Szymon Niewieczerzal, Joanna I.

Late-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment in the elderly with a complex etiology. The most important non-modifiable risk factors for onset and progression of late AMD are age and genetic risk factors, however, little is known about the interplay between genetics and age or sex. Here, we conducted a large-scale age- and sex-stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 1000 Genomes imputed genome-wide and ExomeChip data (&gt;12 million variants). The data were established by the International Age-related Macular Degeneration Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC) from 16,144 late AMD cases and 17,832 controls. Our systematic search for interaction effects yielded significantly stronger effects among younger individuals at two known AMD loci (near &lt;i&gt;CFH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ARMS2/HTRA1&lt;/i&gt;). Accounting for age and gene-age interaction using a joint test identified two additional AMD loci compared to the previous main effect scan. One of these two is a novel AMD GWAS locus, near the retinal clusterin-like protein (&lt;i&gt;CLUL1&lt;/i&gt;) gene, and the other, near the retinaldehyde binding protein 1 (&lt;i&gt;RLBP1&lt;/i&gt;), was recently identified in a joint analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial variants. Despite considerable power in our data, neither sex-dependent effects nor effects with opposite directions between younger and older individuals were observed. This is the first genome-wide interaction study to incorporate age, sex and their interaction with genetic effects for late AMD. Results diminish the potential for a role of sex in the etiology of late AMD yet highlight the importance and existence of age-dependent genetic effects.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas W.

Understanding the relationships between &lt;i&gt;Coffea arabica&lt;/i&gt; L. and the native tree community of secondary forests regrowing after the abandonment of coffee plantations is important because, as a non-native species in the Neotropics, coffee can outcompete native species, reducing diversity and forests ecosystem services. We aimed to answer three questions: 1) Does coffee regeneration in secondary forests differ between shaded and unshaded abandoned plantations?; 2) How is coffee basal area related to structural attributes, species diversity and composition of the native community?; and 3) Do the relationships between coffee and native community differ between tree and sapling components? We sampled the tree and sapling components in a seasonal tropical dry forest that were previously used as shaded and unshaded coffee plantations. Coffee was the most important species in the sapling component of shaded systems, but was almost absent in unshaded ones. Coffee basal area was negatively related with the native density and absolute species richness of the sapling component; and was negatively related with tree density, and positively related with the percentage of pioneer individuals of the native tree component. Our results indicate that coffee persists in secondary forest communities even after more than 70 years of shaded-coffee plantations were abandoned, potentially reducing density and diversity of native species. Despite limitations, which hinder more general conclusions on coffee invasiveness in Brazilian secondary tropical forests, our results indicate that coffee is a strong competitor in the studied secondary forests and provide important insights for future research on this topic.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Raymundo, Jamir Prado-Junior, Norberto Emídio de Oliveira-Neto, Lucas Dezidério Santana, Vagner Santiago do Vale, Tamiel Baiocchi Jacobson, Paulo Eugênio Alves Macedo de Oliveira, Fabrício Alvim Carvalho&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity to respiratory gating, field strength and ventricle segmentation of hemodynamic force quantification in the left and right ventricles of the heart (LV and RV) using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to provide free hemodynamic force analysis software.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A pulsatile flow phantom was imaged using 4D flow MRI and laser-based particle image velocimetry (PIV). Cardiac 4D flow MRI was performed in healthy volunteers at 1.5T (n = 23). Reproducibility was investigated using MR scanners from two different vendors on the same day (n = 8). Subsets of volunteers were also imaged without respiratory gating (n = 17), at 3T on the same day (n = 6), and 1–12 days later on the same scanner (n = 9, median 6 days). Agreement was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Phantom validation showed good accuracy for both scanners (Scanner 1: bias -14±9%, y = 0.82x+0.08, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.96, Scanner 2: bias -12±8%, y = 0.99x-0.08, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.00). Force reproducibility was strong in the LV (0.09±0.07 vs 0.09±0.07 N, bias 0.00±0.04 N, ICC = 0.87) and RV (0.09±0.06 vs 0.09±0.05 N, bias 0.00±0.03, ICC = 0.83). Strong to very strong agreement was found for scans with and without respiratory gating (LV/RV: ICC = 0.94/0.95), scans on different days (ICC = 0.92/0.87), and 1.5T and 3T scans (ICC = 0.93/0.94).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Software for quantification of hemodynamic forces in 4D-flow MRI was developed, and results show high accuracy and strong to very strong reproducibility for both the LV and RV, supporting its use for research and clinical investigations.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity to respiratory gating, field strength and ventricle segmentation of hemodynamic force quantification in the left and right ventricles of the heart (LV and RV) using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to provide free hemodynamic force analysis software.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A pulsatile flow phantom was imaged using 4D flow MRI and laser-based particle image velocimetry (PIV). Cardiac 4D flow MRI was performed in healthy volunteers at 1.5T (n = 23). Reproducibility was investigated using MR scanners from two different vendors on the same day (n = 8).

Spatial heterogeneity in the strength or agents of selection can lead to geographic variation in ecologically important phenotypes. Many dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid toxins from their diets and often exhibit fixed mutations at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, a voltage-gated sodium ion channel associated with alkaloid toxin resistance. Yet previous studies have noted an absence of resistance mutations in individuals from several species known to sequester alkaloid toxins, suggesting possible intraspecific variation for alkaloid resistance in these species. Toxicity and alkaloid profiles vary substantially between populations in several poison frog species (genus &lt;i&gt;Dendrobates&lt;/i&gt;) and are correlated with variation in a suite of related traits such as aposematic coloration. If resistance mutations are costly, due to alterations of channel gating properties, we expect that low toxicity populations will have reduced frequencies and potentially even the loss of resistance alleles. Here, we examine whether intraspecific variation in toxicity in three dendrobatid frogs is associated with intraspecific variation in alleles conferring toxin resistance. Specifically, we examine two species that display marked variation in toxicity throughout their native ranges (&lt;i&gt;Dendrobates pumilio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granuliferus&lt;/i&gt;) and one species with reduced toxicity in its introduced range (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auratus&lt;/i&gt;). However, we find no evidence for population-level variation in alkaloid resistance at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4. In fact, contrary to previous studies, we found that alkaloid resistance alleles were not absent in any populations of these species. All three species exhibit fixed alkaloid resistance mutations throughout their ranges, suggesting that these mutations are maintained even when alkaloid sequestration is substantially reduced.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael L.

Several multiple-media culture systems have become commercially available for on-farm identification of mastitis-associated pathogens. However, the accuracy of these systems has not been thoroughly and independently validated against microbiological evaluations performed by referral laboratories. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of commercially available culture plates (Accumast, Minnesota Easy System, SSGN and SSGNC Quad plates) to identify pathogens associated with clinical mastitis in dairy cows. Milk samples from the affected quarter with clinical mastitis were aerobically cultured with the on-farm culture systems and by two additional reference laboratories. Agreeing results from both standard laboratories were denoted as the reference standard (RS). Accuracy (Ac), sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;) of on-farm plates were determined based on the RS culture of 211 milk samples. All four plate-systems correctly identified ≥ 84.9% of milk samples with no bacterial growth. Accumast had greater values for all overall predictive factors (Ac, Se, Sp, PPV and NPV) and a substantial agreement (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 0.79) with RS. The inter-rater agreements of Minnesota, SSGN, and SSGNC with RS were moderate (0.45 ≤ &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.55). The effectiveness to categorize bacterial colonies at the genus and species was numerically different amongst the commercial plates. Our findings suggest that Accumast was the most accurate on-farm culture system for identification of mastitis-associated pathogens of the four systems included in the analysis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jair C.

Dietary energy intake strongly linked to dialysis outcomes. We aimed to explore the optimal cut-off point of energy intake (EI) for identification of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in hemodialysis patients. The cross-sectional data of 243 hemodialysis patients from multi-dialysis centers in Taiwan was used. The dietary intake was assessed by using the three-day dietary questionnaire, and a 24-hour dietary recall, clinical and biochemical data were also evaluated. The MetS was diagnosed by the Harmonized Metabolic Syndrome criteria. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was to depict the optimal cut-off value of EI for the diagnosis of MetS. The logistic regression was also used to explore the association between inadequate EI and MetS. The optimal cut-off points of EI for identifying the MetS were 26.7 kcal/kg/day for patients aged less than 60 years, or with non-diabetes, and 26.2 kcal/kg/day for patients aged 60 years and above, or with diabetes, respectively. The likelihood of the MetS increased with lower percentiles of energy intake in hemodialysis patients. In the multivariate analysis, the inadequate dietary energy intake strongly determined 3.24 folds of the MetS. The assessment of dietary EI can help healthcare providers detecting patients who are at risk of metabolic syndrome.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tuyen Van Duong, Te-Chih Wong, Hsi-Hsien Chen, Tzen-Wen Chen, Tso-Hsiao Chen, Yung-Ho Hsu, Sheng-Jeng Peng, Ko-Lin Kuo, Chi-Sin Wang, I-Hsin Tseng, Yi-Wei Feng, Tai-Yue Chang, Chien-Tien Su, Shwu-Huey Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer affects 39.6% of Americans at some point during their lifetime. Solid tumor microenvironments are characterized by a disorganized, leaky vasculature that promotes regions of low oxygenation (hypoxia). Tumor hypoxia is a key predictor of poor treatment outcome for all radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy and surgery procedures, and is a hallmark of metastatic potential. In particular, the radiation therapy dose needed to achieve the same tumor control probability in hypoxic tissue as in normoxic tissue can be up to 3 times higher. Even very small tumors (&amp;lt;2–3 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) comprise 10–30% of hypoxic regions in the form of chronic and/or transient hypoxia fluctuating over the course of seconds to days. We investigate the potential of recently developed lipid-stabilized oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) to improve the therapeutic ratio of RT. OMBs, but not nitrogen microbubbles (NMBs), are shown to significantly increase dissolved oxygen content when added to water in vitro and increase tumor oxygen levels in vivo in a rat fibrosarcoma model. Tumor control is significantly improved with OMB but not NMB intra-tumoral injections immediately prior to RT treatment and effect size is shown to depend on initial tumor volume on RT treatment day, as expected.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samantha M.

The aim of this study was to analyze the position of the lumbopelvic region and the muscle activation of erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles in a group of pregnant women in the third trimester. The hypothesis was that pregnancy-related biomechanical and morphological changes modify the position of the lumbopelvic region and the activation of extensor muscles. The position of the lumbar spine and pelvis in the sagittal plane, and the EMG activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles, were recorded during standing in 34 nulliparous and 34 pregnant women in the third trimester, and also two months after birth in the group of pregnant women. No significant differences in the position of the lumbar spine or pelvis between the group of pregnant women and nulliparous or postpartum were observed. A significant increase was observed in the EMG activity of the erector spinae (4.6% vs 2.4% and 2.1% in the nulliparous group and postpartum respectively) and the biceps femoris (3.4% vs 1.2% and 1.4%) in pregnant women compared to the other two groups (p &amp;lt;0.01). We conclude that pregnant women in the third trimester show no alterations in lumbopelvic position compared to nulliparous and postpartum women. However, there is an increase of the EMG activity of the trunk extensors. These results indicate that the extensor muscles of the trunk show, in static positions, adaptive responses to the increase of anterior loads during pregnancy.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gemma Biviá-Roig, Juan Francisco Lisón, Daniel Sánchez-Zuriaga&lt;/p&gt;

These results indicate that the extensor muscles of the trunk show, in static positions, adaptive responses to the increase of anterior loads during pregnancy.</content></content></item><item><published>1523307600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195851</canonicalUrl><updated>1523307600000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195851</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a8:9aea0a7d</id><title>Correction: Climate change versus deforestation: Implications for tree species distribution in the dry forests of southern Ecuador</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195851</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>a0c4fbce</fingerprint><author><name>Carlos E.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Strength training improves distance running economy and performance. This finding is based predominantly on maximal and explosive strength programmes applied to locomotor muscles, particularly on the lower limbs. It is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic cost (C&lt;sub&gt;met&lt;/sub&gt;) and an improvement in running performance is feasible with strength training of the postural and trunk muscles.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using kinematic, neuromuscular and metabolic measurements of running at two different speeds before and after a 12-week Pilates training programme, we tested the hypothesis that core training might improve the running C&lt;sub&gt;met&lt;/sub&gt; and performance of trained runners. Thirty-two individuals were randomly assigned to the control group (CG, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) or the Pilates group (PG, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Confirming our hypothesis, a significant improvement (p&amp;lt;0.05) was observed for running performance in the PG (pre: 25.65±0.4 min; post: 23.23±0.4 min) compared to the CG (pre: 25.33±0.58 min; post: 24.61±0.52 min).

We have previously investigated the physiological role of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on endochondral bone growth, mainly with mutant mouse models deficient in CNP, and reported that CNP is indispensable for physiological endochondral bone growth in mice. However, the survival rate of CNP knockout (KO) mice fell to as low as about 70% until 10 weeks after birth, and we could not sufficiently analyze the phenotype at the adult stage. Herein, we generated CNP KO rats by using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated genome editing technology. We established two lines of mutant rats completely deficient in CNP (CNP KO rats) that exhibited a phenotype identical to that observed in mice deficient in CNP, namely, a short stature with severely impaired endochondral bone growth. Histological analysis revealed that the width of the growth plate, especially that of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, was markedly lower and the proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes tended to be reduced in CNP KO rats. Notably, CNP KO rats did not have malocclusions and survived for over one year after birth. At 33 weeks of age, CNP KO rats persisted significantly shorter than wild-type rats, with closed growth plates of the femur in all samples, which were not observed in wild-type rats. Histologically, CNP deficiency affected only bones among all body tissues studied. Thus, CNP KO rats survive over one year, and exhibit a deficit in endochondral bone growth and growth retardation throughout life.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Toshihito Fujii, Keisho Hirota, Akihiro Yasoda, Akiko Takizawa, Naomi Morozumi, Ryuichi Nakamura, Takafumi Yotsumoto, Eri Kondo, Yui Yamashita, Yoriko Sakane, Yugo Kanai, Yohei Ueda, Ichiro Yamauchi, Shigeki Yamanaka, Kazumasa Nakao, Koichiro Kuwahara, Toshimasa Jindo, Mayumi Furuya, Tomoji Mashimo, Nobuya Inagaki, Tadao Serikawa, Kazuwa Nakao&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic assessment tools remain suboptimal in demonstrating complex morphology of congenital heart disease (CHD). This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing. Qualitative analysis was conducted by distributing surveys to six health professionals (two radiologists, two cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons) and three medical academics to assess the clinical value of the 3D printed model in these three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was noted in the measurements between CCTA and 3D printed model, with a mean difference of 0.23 mm. Four out of six health professionals found the model to be useful in facilitating preoperative planning, while all of them thought that the model would be invaluable in enhancing patient-doctor communication. All three medical academics found the model to be helpful in teaching, and thought that the students will be able to learn the pathology quicker with better understanding.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The complex cardiac anatomy can be accurately replicated in flexible material using 3D printing technology. 3D printed heart models could serve as an excellent tool in facilitating preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education, although further studies with inclusion of more clinical cases are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Wen Wen Lau, Dongting Liu, Lei Xu, Zhanming Fan, Zhonghua Sun&lt;/p&gt;

Here we used different cryo–electron microscopy approaches to determine structures of native and solubilized ribosome-Sec61-OST complexes. A molecular model for the catalytic OST subunit STT3A (staurosporine and temperature sensitive 3A) revealed how it is integrated into the OST and how STT3-paralog specificity for translocon-associated OST is achieved.

Here we used different cryo–electron microscopy approaches to determine structures of native and solubilized ribosome-Sec61-OST complexes. A molecular model for the catalytic OST subunit STT3A (staurosporine and temperature sensitive 3A) revealed how it is integrated into the OST and how STT3-paralog specificity for translocon-associated OST is achieved.

Background &lt;p&gt;In parturients with increased physiologically intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and a short stature, a greater cephalad spread of spinal anesthesia is often observed after a fixed amount of plain bupivacaine is administered. Therefore, we designed this prospective study to test whether IAP and vertebral column length (VCL) were predictors of spinal spread in parturients undergoing a cesarean section.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 113 parturients, all undergoing elective cesarean sections with single-shot spinal anesthesia, were enrolled. The L3-L4 interspace was entered, and 2 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space. Upon loss of temperature sensation at the T4 level, IAP was measured through a bladder catheter while the patient was in the supine position with a 10°left lateral tilt. Parturient demographic variables, including age, height, weight, IAP, and VCL were recorded. Linear regressions and multiple regressions were performed to analyze the relationships between parturient variables and the spread of spinal anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 109 parturients were included in the analysis. Linear regression analysis showed a significant univariate correlation of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), IAP, and VCL with cephalad spread (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.004). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that IAP and VCL were the key determinants of spinal spread (both &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), where as exclusion of age, weight, and height did not change the result (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt; 0.209).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that IAP and VCL were significant predictors of intrathecal spread of plain bupivacaine, and there was a positive association between IAP and abdominal girth in term parturients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ting-ting Ni, Ying Zhou, An-cui Yong, Lu Wang, Qing-he Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

The anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and cytoprotective activity of the &lt;i&gt;Attalea phalerata&lt;/i&gt; Mart. ex Spreng pulp oil was evaluated by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; methods.

Our data demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;phalerata&lt;/i&gt; oil has high carotenoid content, antioxidant activity and the presence of 5 essential amino acids. In the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models of inflammation, the oil demonstrated the capacity to inhibit COX1 and COX2 enzymes, the production of nitric oxide and also induces macrophages to spreading.

In the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of antiproliferative and cytoprotective activity, the oil was shown inactive against the kidney carcinoma and prostate carcinoma lineage cells and with cytoprotective capacity in murine fibroblast cells, inhibiting the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin.

ExperimentalSERS spectra from Au and Ag nanodics show similar peaks, but those from Au-Ag alloyreveal new spectral features. The physical enhancement factors due to surface nano-texture wereconsidered by numerical simulations of light intensity distribution for the nano-textured Au, Ag,and Au-Ag alloy surfaces, but found to cause only minor differences. For the chemical insights ofenhancement, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using Au20, Ag20,and Au10Ag10 clusters of a pyramidal structure for SERS modeling.

ExperimentalSERS spectra from Au and Ag nanodics show similar peaks, but those from Au-Ag alloyreveal new spectral features. The physical enhancement factors due to surface nano-texture wereconsidered by numerical simulations of light intensity distribution for the nano-textured Au, Ag,and Au-Ag alloy surfaces, but found to cause only minor differences. For the chemical insights ofenhancement, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using Au20, Ag20,and Au10Ag10 clusters of a pyramidal structure for SERS modeling. Binding of 22BPY to the clusterswas simulated by considering possible arrangements of vertex and planar physical as well aschemical adsorption models. A qualitative match with experimental SERS results for the pure Auand Ag was obtained.

Background &lt;p&gt;Swimming in fecally-contaminated waterbodies can result in gastrointestinal infections. However, the pathogenic microorganisms responsible are not well understood because sporadic cases of illness are not reported completely, exposure information is often not collected, and epidemiology studies rely on self-reported symptoms. Noroviruses are considered a likely cause because they are found in high densities in sewage, resistant to wastewater treatment and survive in the environment. In this study, saliva samples were collected from subjects at a beach in Puerto Rico and tested for evidence of norovirus-specific IgG responses as an indicator of incident norovirus infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Saliva samples were collected from 1298 participants using an oral swab. Samples were collected on the day of the beach visit (S1); after 10–12 days (S2); and after three weeks (S3). Saliva was tested for IgG responses to GI.1 and GII.4 noroviruses using a microsphere based multiplex salivary immunoassay. Immunoconversion was defined as a four-fold increase in median fluorescence intensity (MFI) from S1 to S2 with the S3 sample at least three times above the S1 MFI.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-four subjects (2.6%) immunoconverted to GI.1 or GII.4 norovirus. Swimmers who immersed their head in water had a higher rate of immunoconversion (3.4%), compared to either non-swimmers (0.0%, p = 0.003) or waders and non-swimmers combined (0.4%, Odds Ratio: 5.07, 95% Confidence Interval:1.48–17.00). Immunoconversion was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study to demonstrate an association between swimming at a beach impacted by fecal contamination and asymptomatic norovirus infection. The findings implicate recreational water as potentially important transmission pathway for norovirus infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Timothy J.

Transfer entropy from non-uniform embedding is a popular tool for the inference of causal relationships among dynamical subsystems. In this study we present an approach that makes use of low-dimensional conditional mutual information quantities to decompose the original high-dimensional conditional mutual information in the searching procedure of non-uniform embedding for significant variables at different lags. We perform a series of simulation experiments to assess the sensitivity and specificity of our proposed method to demonstrate its advantage compared to previous algorithms. The results provide concrete evidence that low-dimensional approximations can help to improve the statistical accuracy of transfer entropy in multivariate causality analysis and yield a better performance over other methods. The proposed method is especially efficient as the data length grows.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The proposed method is especially efficient as the data length grows.</content></content></item><item><published>1521234000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194334</canonicalUrl><updated>1521234000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194334</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849e2:34f43e70</id><title>A complete logical approach to resolve the evolution and dynamics of mitochondrial genome in bilaterians</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194334</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ecf3d70</fingerprint><author><name>Laurent Oxusoff</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194334</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurent Oxusoff, Pascal Préa, Yvan Perez&lt;/p&gt;
Investigating how recombination might modify gene order during the evolution has become a routine part of mitochondrial genome analysis. A new method of genomic maps analysis based on formal logic is described. The purpose of this method is to 1) use mitochondrial gene order of current taxa as datasets 2) calculate rearrangements between all mitochondrial gene orders and 3) reconstruct phylogenetic relationships according to these calculated rearrangements within a tree under the assumption of maximum parsimony. Unlike existing methods mainly based on the probabilistic approach, the main strength of this new approach is that it calculates all the exact tree solutions with completeness and provides logical consequences as highly robust results. Moreover, this method infers all possible hypothetical ancestors and reconstructs character states for all internal nodes of the trees. We started by testing our method using the deuterostomes as a study case. Then, with sponges as an outgroup, we investigated the evolutionary history of mitochondrial genomes of 47 bilaterian phyla and emphasised the peculiar case of chaetognaths. This pilot work showed that the use of formal logic in a hypothetico-deductive background such as phylogeny (where experimental testing of hypotheses is impossible) is very promising to explore mitochondrial gene order in deuterostomes and should be applied to many other bilaterian clades.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Laurent Oxusoff, Pascal Préa, Yvan Perez&lt;/p&gt;

However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells. To this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn&apos;s disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (p_rs102275=1.44e-20, p_rs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p&amp;lt;0.05). In summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmunity.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic risk loci for autoimmune diseases.

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new more thermostable Flolan (epoprostenol) solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent in Japanese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) receiving higher doses of Flolan than those typically administered in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This open-label, single-arm study was conducted in 10 Japanese PAH patients. During the run-in period, patients were intravenously infused with Flolan (45 ng/kg/min or higher doses) solution prepared with the existing pH 10.5 diluent. The patients were then switched to a new more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent and observed for a 4-week treatment period. As a primary endpoint, safety after switching to the new Flolan solution was evaluated. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamics and the necessity for dose adjustment of Flolan in these patients.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All 10 patients completed the study period. Observed adverse events were nausea and hepatic function abnormal in 1 patient each, and both events were mild. No patients required dose adjustment due to the change from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) measured 3 hrs after switching to Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated diluent. No major changes from baseline in mPAP, pulmonary vascular resistance, or right atrial pressure were observed at 24 hrs and at 4 weeks after switching to the Flolan solution prepared with pH 12.0 diluent. Although some patients showed increases in cardiac output (CO) from baseline at 24 hrs and 4 weeks, no patients required dose reduction as a result of an increase in CO.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Neither safety/efficacy concerns nor any dose adjustments of Flolan after switching to a more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent could be required in Japanese patients with PAH receiving higher doses of Flolan.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02705807&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kazuko Mihara, Aiko Ogawa, Hiromi Matsubara, Takumi Terao, Yoshitaka Ichikawa&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Scuba diver fitness is paramount to confront environmental stressors of diving. However, the diving population is aging and the increasing prevalence of diseases may be a concern for diver fitness.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to assess the demographics, lifestyle factors, disease prevalence, and healthcare access and utilization of Divers Alert Network (DAN) members and compare them with those from the general population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;DAN membership health survey (DMHS) was administered online in 2011 to DAN members in the United States (US). Health status of DMHS respondents was compared with the general US population data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System using two-sided student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests and Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with healthcare utilization among the DMHS participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to the general US population, the DMHS population had lower prevalence of asthma, heart attack, angina, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and disabilities (p&amp;lt;0.01); more heavy alcohol drinkers, and fewer smokers (p&amp;lt;0.01); and greater access and utilization (routine checkup) of healthcare (p&amp;lt;0.01). Healthcare utilization in males was lower than among females. Increasing age and increase in the number of chronic illnesses were associated with increased healthcare utilization.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;DAN members are healthier than the general US population.

Cabbage (&lt;i&gt;Brassica oleracea&lt;/i&gt; L. var. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt;), an important vegetable crop in the Brassicaceae family, is economically important worldwide. In the process of hybrid seed production, Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (OguCMS), controlled by the mitochondrial gene &lt;i&gt;orf138&lt;/i&gt;, has been extensively used for cabbage hybrid production with complete and stable male sterility. To identify the critical genes and pathways involved in the sterility and to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, the anther of OguCMS line R2P2CMS and the fertile line R2P2 were used for RNA-seq and iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) proteome analysis. RNA-seq analysis generated 13,037,109 to 13,066,594 SE50-clean reads, from the sterile and fertile lines, which were assembled into 36,890 unigenes. Among them, 1,323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, consisting of 307 up- and 1016 down-regulated genes. For ITRAQ analysis, a total of 7,147 unique proteins were identified, and 833 were differentially expressed including 538 up- and 295 down-regulated proteins. These were mainly annotated to the ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA surveillance pathways. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified 22 and 70 genes with the same and opposite expression profiles, respectively. Using KEGG analysis of DEGs, gibberellin mediated signaling pathways regulating tapetum programmed cell death and four different pathways involved in sporopollenin synthesis were identified. Secretion and translocation of the sporopollenin precursors were identified, and the key genes participating in these pathways were all significantly down-regulated in R2P2CMS. Light and transmission electron (TE) microscopy revealed fat abnormal tapetum rather than vacuolization and degradation at the tetrad and microspore stages of the OguCMS line. This resulted in the failed deposition of sporopollenin on the pollen resulting in sterility. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism underlying OguCMS in cabbage.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miaomiao Xing, Chao Sun, Hailong Li, Shilin Hu, Lei Lei, Jungen Kang&lt;/p&gt;

RNA-seq analysis generated 13,037,109 to 13,066,594 SE50-clean reads, from the sterile and fertile lines, which were assembled into 36,890 unigenes. Among them, 1,323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, consisting of 307 up- and 1016 down-regulated genes. For ITRAQ analysis, a total of 7,147 unique proteins were identified, and 833 were differentially expressed including 538 up- and 295 down-regulated proteins. These were mainly annotated to the ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA surveillance pathways. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified 22 and 70 genes with the same and opposite expression profiles, respectively. Using KEGG analysis of DEGs, gibberellin mediated signaling pathways regulating tapetum programmed cell death and four different pathways involved in sporopollenin synthesis were identified. Secretion and translocation of the sporopollenin precursors were identified, and the key genes participating in these pathways were all significantly down-regulated in R2P2CMS. Light and transmission electron (TE) microscopy revealed fat abnormal tapetum rather than vacuolization and degradation at the tetrad and microspore stages of the OguCMS line. This resulted in the failed deposition of sporopollenin on the pollen resulting in sterility. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism underlying OguCMS in cabbage.</content></content></item><item><published>1520924400000</published><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Author Correction: Electroporation of mice zygotes with dual guide RNA/Cas9 complexes for simple and efficient cloning-free genome editing</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22724-9</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1621ea75a37:2c77d8:34f43e70</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22724-9</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/zRZwSoPOBUk/s41598-018-22724-9</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ad162468</fingerprint><author><name>Marie Teixeira</name></author><crawled>1520932706871</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22724-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Electroporation of mice zygotes with dual guide RNA/Cas9 complexes for simple and efficient cloning-free genome editing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Electroporation of mice zygotes with dual guide RNA/Cas9 complexes for simple and efficient cloning-free genome editing, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22724-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22724-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Electroporation of mice zygotes with dual guide RNA/Cas9 complexes for simple and efficient cloning-free genome editing&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/zRZwSoPOBUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Electroporation of mice zygotes with dual guide RNA/Cas9 complexes for simple and efficient cloning-free genome editing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Electroporation of mice zygotes with dual guide RNA/Cas9 complexes for simple and efficient cloning-free genome editing, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22724-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22724-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Electroporation of mice zygotes with dual guide RNA/Cas9 complexes for simple and efficient cloning-free genome editing&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/zRZwSoPOBUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522357200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194845</canonicalUrl><updated>1522357200000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194845</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef04:7d6c1c1c</id><title>Flip-flop method: A new T1-weighted flow-MRI for plants studies</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194845</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>1a9229ed</fingerprint><author><name>Simon Buy</name></author><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194845</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simon Buy, Simon Le Floch, Ning Tang, Rahima Sidiboulenouar, Michel Zanca, Patrick Canadas, Eric Nativel, Maida Cardoso, Eric Alibert, Guillaume Dupont, Dominique Ambard, Christophe Maurel, Jean-Luc Verdeil, Nadia Bertin, Christophe Goze-Bac, Christophe Coillot&lt;/p&gt;
The climate warming implies an increase of stress of plants (drought and torrential rainfall). The understanding of plant behavior, in this context, takes a major importance and sap flow measurement in plants remains a key issue for plant understanding. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which is well known to be a powerful tool to access water quantity can be used to measure moving water.

Vitellogenesis is the process of yolk formation via accumulating vitellin (Vn) with nutrients in the oocytes. Expression of vitellogenin (Vg), the precursor of Vn, is one of the indicators for the start of vitellogenesis. In Pacific white shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Litopenaeus vannamei&lt;/i&gt;), the type-II vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone (VIH-2) effectively suppresses hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression. In this study, we demonstrate the increasing transcript levels of hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; during &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vannamei&lt;/i&gt; ovarian development, suggesting that the hepatopancreas-derived Vg/Vn may also contribute to vitellogenesis in this species. Using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; injections and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; primary cell cultures, we provide evidences that the inhibition of VIH-2 on hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; gene expression is mediated through a functional coupling of the GC/cGMP pathway with different MAPK-dependent cascades in female shrimp. In VIH-2 signaling, the NO-independent GC/cGMP/PKG cascades were upstream of the MAPKs. Activations of the MAPK signal by VIH-2 include the phosphorylation of JNK and the mRNA/protein expression of P&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;MAPK. Additionally, the cAMP/PKA pathway is another positive intracellular signal for hepatopancreatic &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression but is independent of its VIH-2 regulation. Our findings establish a model for the signal transduction mechanism of Vg regulation by VIH and shed light on the biological functions and signaling of the CHH family in crustaceans.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ting Chen, Chunhua Ren, Xiao Jiang, Lvping Zhang, Hongmei Li, Wen Huang, Chaoqun Hu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing breastfeeding rates have been associated with reductions in disease in babies and mothers as well as in related costs. ‘Nourishing Start for Health (NoSH)’, a financial incentive scheme has been proposed as a potentially effective way to increase both the number of mothers breastfeeding and duration of breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt; Aims &lt;p&gt;To establish women’s relative preferences for different aspects of a financial incentive scheme for breastfeeding and to identify importance of scheme characteristics on probability on participation in an incentive scheme.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A discrete choice experiment (DCE) obtained information on alternative specifications of the NoSH scheme designed to promote continued breastfeeding duration until at least 6 weeks after birth. Four attributes framed alternative scheme designs: value of the incentive; minimum breastfeeding duration required to receive incentive; method of verifying breastfeeding; type of incentive. Three versions of the DCE questionnaire, each containing 8 different choice sets, provided 24 choice sets for analysis. The questionnaire was mailed to 2,531 women in the South Yorkshire Cohort (SYC) aged 16–45 years in IMD quintiles 3–5. The analytic approach considered conditional and mixed effects logistic models to account for preference heterogeneity that may be associated with a variation in effects mediated by respondents’ characteristics.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;564 women completed the questionnaire and a response rate of 22% was achieved. Most of the included attributes were found to affect utility and therefore the probability to participate in the incentive scheme. Higher rewards were preferred, although the type of incentive significantly affected women’s preferences on average. We found evidence for preference heterogeneity based on individual characteristics that mediated preferences for an incentive scheme.ConclusionsAlthough participants’ opinion in our sample was mixed, financial incentives for breastfeeding may be an acceptable and effective instrument to change behaviour. However, individual characteristics could mediate the effect and should therefore be considered when developing and targeting future interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Frauke Becker, Nana Anokye, Esther W. de Bekker-Grob, Ailish Higgins, Clare Relton, Mark Strong, Julia Fox-Rushby&lt;/p&gt;

Immune-compromised mouse models allow for testing the preclinical efficacy of human cell transplantations and gene therapy strategies before moving forward to clinical trials. However, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of the &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sh&lt;/sup&gt; mouse strain to create an immune-compromised model lacking function of &lt;i&gt;Rag2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Il2rγ&lt;/i&gt; led to unexpected morbidity and mortality. This warranted an investigation to ascertain the cause and predisposing factors associated with the outbreak. Postmortem examination was performed on 15 moribund mice. The main lesions observed in these mice consisted of ascending urogenital tract infections, suppurative otitis media, pneumonia, myocarditis, and meningoencephalomyelitis. As &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains harboring polyketide synthase (&lt;i&gt;pks)&lt;/i&gt; genomic island were recently isolated from laboratory mice, the tissue sections from the urogenital tract, heart, and middle ear were subjected to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; specific PNA-FISH assay that revealed discrete colonies of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; associated with the lesions. Microbiological examination and 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. coli-induced infection and septicemia in the affected mice. Further characterization by &lt;i&gt;clb&lt;/i&gt; gene analysis and colibactin toxicity assays of the &lt;i&gt;pks+ E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; revealed colibactin-associated cytotoxicity. Rederivation of the transgenic mice using embryo transfer produced mice with an intestinal flora devoid of &lt;i&gt;pks+ E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. Importantly, these barrier-maintained rederived mice have produced multiple litters without adverse health effects. This report is the first to describe acute morbidity and mortality associated with &lt;i&gt;pks+ E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; urosepsis and meningitis in immunocompromised mice, and highlights the importance of monitoring and exclusion of colibactin-producing &lt;i&gt;pks+ E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vasudevan Bakthavatchalu, Katherine J.

This report is the first to describe acute morbidity and mortality associated with &lt;i&gt;pks+ E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; urosepsis and meningitis in immunocompromised mice, and highlights the importance of monitoring and exclusion of colibactin-producing &lt;i&gt;pks+ E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content></item><item><published>1520838000000</published><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><unread>False</unread><title>Feasibility and patient acceptability of a novel artificial intelligence-based screening model for diabetic retinopathy at endocrinology outpatient services: a pilot study</title><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22612-2</originId><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1621da336ef:156f39:34f43e70</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22612-2</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/m6R4rJB_xpI/s41598-018-22612-2</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>177c5be0</fingerprint><author><name>Stuart Keel</name></author><crawled>1520915658479</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22612-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feasibility and patient acceptability of a novel artificial intelligence-based screening model for diabetic retinopathy at endocrinology outpatient services: a pilot study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feasibility and patient acceptability of a novel artificial intelligence-based screening model for diabetic retinopathy at endocrinology outpatient services: a pilot study, Published online: 12 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22612-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22612-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Feasibility and patient acceptability of a novel artificial intelligence-based screening model for diabetic retinopathy at endocrinology outpatient services: a pilot study&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/m6R4rJB_xpI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feasibility and patient acceptability of a novel artificial intelligence-based screening model for diabetic retinopathy at endocrinology outpatient services: a pilot study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feasibility and patient acceptability of a novel artificial intelligence-based screening model for diabetic retinopathy at endocrinology outpatient services: a pilot study, Published online: 12 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22612-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22612-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Feasibility and patient acceptability of a novel artificial intelligence-based screening model for diabetic retinopathy at endocrinology outpatient services: a pilot study&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/m6R4rJB_xpI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521752400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</canonicalUrl><updated>1521752400000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123922:9f3b30f2</id><title>Most women living with HIV can deliver vaginally—National data from Finland 1993–2013</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>f1ad52a1</fingerprint><author><name>Inka Aho</name></author><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inka Aho, Marja Kaijomaa, Pia Kivelä, Heljä-Marja Surcel, Jussi Sutinen, Oskari Heikinheimo, with the FINHIVPREG Study team &lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Vaginal delivery has been recommended for more than ten years for women living with HIV (WLWH) with good virological control. However, in Europe most WLWH still deliver by cesarean section (CS). Our aim was to assess the rate of vaginal delivery and the indications for CS in WLWH over 20 years in a setting of low overall CS rate.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of all WLWH delivering in Finland 1993–2013. We identified the women by combining national health registers and extracted data from patient files.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study comprised 212 women with 290 deliveries. Over 35% of the women delivered several children during the study years. During 2000–2013, with consistent viral load monitoring, 80.0% showed HIV viral loads &amp;lt;50 copies/mL in the last measurement preceding the delivery. Altogether 74.5% of all WLWH delivered vaginally and the rate of both elective CS and emergency CS was 12.8% each. For most CSs (63.5%) the indication was obstetrical, for 28.4% it was avoiding HIV transmission and for 0.7% it was mother’s request. In hospitals with less than ten HIV-related deliveries during the study period, the rate of elective CS was higher than in more experienced hospitals (22.7% versus 10.6% [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024]). No perinatal HIV transmissions occurred.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most WLWH can achieve good virological control and deliver vaginally. This will help them to maintain their future child bearing potential and reduce CS-related morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Inka Aho, Marja Kaijomaa, Pia Kivelä, Heljä-Marja Surcel, Jussi Sutinen, Oskari Heikinheimo, with the FINHIVPREG Study team &lt;/p&gt;

Heparan sulfate 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfotransferases (HS3STs) catalyze the final maturation step of heparan sulfates. Although seven HS3ST isozymes have been described in human, 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfation is a relatively rare modification, and only a few biological processes have been described to be influenced by 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfated motifs. A conflicting literature has recently reported that HS3ST2, 3A, 3B and 4 may exhibit either tumor-promoting or anti-oncogenic properties, depending on the model used and cancer cell phenotype. Hence, we decided to compare the consequences of the overexpression of each of these HS3STs in the same cellular model. We demonstrated that, unlike HS3ST3A, the other three isozymes enhanced the proliferation of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells. Moreover, the colony forming capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells was markedly increased by the expression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4. No notable difference was observed between the three isozymes, meaning that the modifications catalyzed by each HS3ST had the same functional impact on cell behavior. We then demonstrated that overexpression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4 was accompanied by increased activation of c-Src, Akt and NF-κB and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and XIAP. In line with these findings, we showed that HS3ST-transfected cells are more resistant to cell death induction by pro-apoptotic stimuli or NK cells. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that HS3ST2, 3B and 4 share the same pro-tumoral activity and support the idea that these HS3STs could compensate each other for loss of their expression depending on the molecular signature of cancer cells and/or changes in the tumor environment.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charles Hellec, Maxime Delos, Mathieu Carpentier, Agnès Denys, Fabrice Allain&lt;/p&gt;

Anthocyanins are naturally active substances. In this study, anthocyanins from black rice were obtained by membrane filtration and column chromatography separation. Five anthocyanin monomers in black rice extract were identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and the major anthocyanin monomer (cyanidin-3-glucoside, C3G) was purified by preparative HPLC (Pre-HPLC). The proliferative effects of the anthocyanins on Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were investigated by determining the media pH, bacterial populations and metabolic products. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, not only the pH of the media containing C3G was lower than that of the extract of black rice anthocyanin (BRAE), but the numbers of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were also significantly increased. Furthermore, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, and hydroxybenzoic acids and other metabolites were detected by GC-MS &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our results revealed that the anthocyanins and anthocyanin monomers from black rice had prebiotic activity and they were metabolized into several small molecules by Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yongsheng Zhu, Hanju Sun, Shudong He, Qiuyan Lou, Min Yu, Mingming Tang, Lijun Tu&lt;/p&gt;

The present research addresses the question of whether regulatory-mode orientations affect self-forgiveness. We expected that people with a strong locomotion orientation would be more inclined to self-forgiveness because of their tendencies toward movement and change, which focus them on the future, whereas people with a strong assessment orientation would refrain from self-forgiveness due to their evaluative tendencies which focus them on the past. These hypotheses were supported by the results in four studies that tested the relation between regulatory modes and self-forgiveness by measuring (Studies 1, 3 and 4) and manipulating (Study 2) regulatory-mode-orientations. Finally, in Study 4 we examined more closely our hypothesis that the relation between self-forgiveness and regulatory modes is mediated by past and future temporal foci. The implications of the results for regulatory mode theory are also discussed.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Pierro, Gennaro Pica, Anna Maria Giannini, E.

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Prada, Manju Sasi, Corinna Martin, Sibylle Jablonka, Thomas Dandekar, Robert Blum&lt;/p&gt;

Elucidation of the neural correlates of time perception constitutes an important research topic in cognitive neuroscience. The focus to date has been on durations in the millisecond to seconds range, but here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine brain functional connectivity during much longer durations (i.e., 15 min). For this purpose, we conducted an initial exploratory experiment followed by a confirmatory experiment. Our results showed that those participants who overestimated time exhibited lower activity of beta (18–30 Hz) at several electrode sites. Furthermore, graph theoretical analysis indicated significant differences in the beta range (15–30 Hz) between those that overestimated and underestimated time. Participants who underestimated time showed higher clustering coefficient compared to those that overestimated time. We discuss our results in terms of two aspects. FFT results, as a linear approach, are discussed within localized/dedicated models (i.e., scalar timing model). Second, non-localized properties of psychological interval timing (as emphasized by intrinsic models) are addressed and discussed based on results derived from graph theory. Results suggested that although beta amplitude in central regions (related to activity of BG-thalamocortical pathway as a dedicated module) is important in relation to timing mechanisms, the properties of functional activity of brain networks; such as the segregation of beta network, are also crucial for time perception. These results may suggest subjective time may be created by vector units instead of scalar ticks.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amir Hossein Ghaderi, Shadi Moradkhani, Arvin Haghighatfard, Fatemeh Akrami, Zahra Khayyer, Fuat Balcı&lt;/p&gt;

Trial design &lt;p&gt;The QoLKAMON study evaluated quality of life, efficacy and treatment safety in HIV patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir in monotherapy (MT) versus continuing combined antiretroviral triple treatment with a boosted protease inhibitor (TT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a 24-week, open-label, multicentre study in virologically-suppressed HIV-infected participants (N = 225) with a 2:1 randomization: 146 patients who switched to MT were compared with 79 patients who remained on a TT regimen. The primary endpoint was change in patient-reported outcomes in quality of life as measured by the MOS-HIV and EQ-5D questionnaires. Secondary endpoints included treatment adherence, patient satisfaction, incidence of adverse events and differences in plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) and CD4 cell counts.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Baseline quality of life, measured with the MOS-HIV score, was very good (overall score of 83 ± 10.5 in the MT arm and 82.3 ± 11.3 in the TT arm) and suffered no change during the study in any of the arms (at week 24, 83.5 ± 12.2 in MT arm and 81.9 ± 12.7 in TT arm), without statistically significant differences when compared. In regards to adherence to therapy and patient satisfaction, some aspects (number of doses forgotten in the last week and satisfaction of treatment measured with the CESTA score, dimension 1) improved significantly with MT.

Trial design &lt;p&gt;The QoLKAMON study evaluated quality of life, efficacy and treatment safety in HIV patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir in monotherapy (MT) versus continuing combined antiretroviral triple treatment with a boosted protease inhibitor (TT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a 24-week, open-label, multicentre study in virologically-suppressed HIV-infected participants (N = 225) with a 2:1 randomization: 146 patients who switched to MT were compared with 79 patients who remained on a TT regimen. The primary endpoint was change in patient-reported outcomes in quality of life as measured by the MOS-HIV and EQ-5D questionnaires. Secondary endpoints included treatment adherence, patient satisfaction, incidence of adverse events and differences in plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) and CD4 cell counts.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Baseline quality of life, measured with the MOS-HIV score, was very good (overall score of 83 ± 10.5 in the MT arm and 82.3 ± 11.3 in the TT arm) and suffered no change during the study in any of the arms (at week 24, 83.5 ± 12.2 in MT arm and 81.9 ± 12.7 in TT arm), without statistically significant differences when compared. In regards to adherence to therapy and patient satisfaction, some aspects (number of doses forgotten in the last week and satisfaction of treatment measured with the CESTA score, dimension 1) improved significantly with MT. There were also no differences in the incidence and severity of adverse events, even though 22.8% of those in the MT arm switched their treatment when they were included in the study. Moreover, there was also no significant difference between the immunological and virological evolution of MT and TT. In the MT arm, the VL was always undetectable in 83% of patients (vs 90.7% in the TT arm) and there were only 6.7% of virological failures with VL &gt; 50 copies/mL (vs 2.3% in the TT arm), without resistance mutations and with resuppression of VL after switching back to TT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In a new clinical trial, monotherapy as a treatment simplification strategy in HIV-1 infected patients with sustained viral suppression has demonstrated quality of life, safety and efficacy profiles comparable to those of conventional triple therapy regimens.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521504000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><unread>False</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Current non-invasive approaches for detection of urothelial cancers are suboptimal.

Our understanding on the importance of viral lysis in the functioning of tropical estuarine ecosystem is limited. This study examines viral infection of prokaryotes and subsequent lysis of cells belonging to different morphotypes across a salinity gradient in monsoon driven estuarine ecosystem (Cochin estuary, India). High standing stock of viruses and prokaryotes accompanied by lytic infection rates in the euryhaline/mesohaline region of the estuary suggests salinity to have an influential role in driving interactions between prokaryotes and viruses. High prokaryotic mortality rates, up to 42% of prokaryote population in the pre-monsoon season is further substantiated by a high virus to prokaryote ratio (VPR), suggesting that maintenance of a high number of viruses is dependent on the most active fraction of bacterioplankton. Although myoviruses were the dominant viral morphotype (mean = 43%) throughout the study period, there was significant variation among prokaryotic morphotypes susceptible to viral infection. Among them, the viral infected short rod prokaryote morphotype with lower burst estimates (mean = 18 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was dominant (35%) in the dry seasons whereas a substantial increase in cocci forms (30%) infected by viruses with high burst size (mean = 31 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident during the monsoon season. Such preferential infections of prokaryotic morphopopulations with respect to seasons can have a strong and variable impact on the carbon and energy flow in this tropical ecosystem.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vijayan Jasna, Angia Sriram Pradeep Ram, Ammini Parvathi, Telesphore Sime-Ngando&lt;/p&gt;

Given a selection of older papers from the journal that readers were unfamiliar with, could they pick out the ones that ended up getting cited more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this work, revised and expanded, is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903&quot;&gt;subject of a paper&lt;/a&gt; in PLOS ONE (open access, by definition), and the author line features some blog pseudonyms, interestingly. A 2003 issue of JACS was selected, and respondents were asked the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers in the issue to you think are the most ‘significant’ (your own definition of ‘significant’ is what is important here)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without looking up numbers, which three papers do you think will have been cited the most to-date?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you most want to point out to other chemists?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you want to shout about from the rooftops (i.e., tell anybody about, not just chemists)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to say that I seem to have skewed the set of responders a bit, since it appears that many of the people who answered the survey were readers of this blog following a link. Looking over the papers that were suggested, it seems that the correlation between the first set and the third (significant, and should be shared with other chemists) was pretty strong, as you might think, but that correlation between “significant” and “will have been cited the most” was somewhat weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the correlation between what respondents thought would be the most cited articles and the actual ten-years-later citation counts was quite poor (see the paper’s Figure 1). Looking at Figure 2, you can see that none of the other questions, in fact, correlate well with the real citation counts (I would be rather unhappy if these graphs represented project assay correlations!) Of course, it’s also true that the respondents disagreed pretty significantly about which papers were significant in the first place. That’s strong evidence that the survey set was indeed composed of practicing chemists, because we rarely agree on much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there indeed differences between “interesting, thought-provoking” papers and ones that you feel like telling other chemists about? Or between those and the ones that pick up citations? These data, though far from comprehensive, suggest that both of these may be true (as does ones own intuition, for what that’s worth). The paper tries to correlate responses to the reported areas of specialization of the responders, and there may well be something to that. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja034820y&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was cited 325 times over the next ten years, but only five responders to the survey picked it as one that would get cited. All five of them, though, indicated that they specialized in this general area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0345423&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was selected by many survey responders as one that would pick up citations, but its actual ten-year citation count was average-to-modest. My own guess here (I may have picked this one myself!) was that the title sounded like something “hot”, by current standards, and it surely would have been picked up on. But that shows you the peril of such gut feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does is drive yet another nail into the idea that current publication-based measures to evaluate research importance, quality, and impact are much good at all. They aren’t. The paper finishes up on just this point, referencing several other initiatives that are trying to overturn citation counts, h-indices, journal impact factors and so on. These things are measures, sure enough, but they’re not necessarily measuring very much, and not necessarily what some of their users think that they’re measuring!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Back in 2013, I mentioned the “JACS Challenge”, an interesting attempt to see if papers that eventually got cited a lot were obvious prima facie.

When some individuals are screen-detected before the beginning of the study, but otherwise would have been diagnosed symptomatically during the study, this results in different case-ascertainment probabilities among screened and unscreened participants, referred to here as lead-time-biased case-ascertainment (LTBCA). In fact, this issue can arise even in risk-factor studies nested within a randomized screening trial; even though the screening intervention is randomly allocated to trial arms, there is no randomization to potential risk-factors and uptake of screening can differ by risk-factor strata. Under the assumptions that neither screening nor the risk factor affects underlying incidence and no other forms of bias operate, we simulate and compare the underlying cumulative incidence and that observed in the study due to LTBCA. The example used will be constructed from the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial. The derived mathematical model is applied to simulating two nested studies to evaluate the potential for screening bias in observational lung cancer studies. Because of differential screening under plausible assumptions about preclinical incidence and duration, the simulations presented here show that LTBCA due to chest x-ray screening can significantly increase the estimated risk of lung cancer due to smoking by 1% and 50%. Traditional adjustment methods cannot account for this bias, as the influence screening has on observational study estimates involves events outside of the study observation window (enrollment and follow-up) that change eligibility for potential participants, thus biasing case ascertainment.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rick J.

Estimation of visibility bias is critical to accurately compute abundance of wild populations. The franciscana, &lt;i&gt;Pontoporia blainvillei&lt;/i&gt;, is considered the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Aerial surveys are considered the most effective method to estimate abundance of this species, but many existing estimates have been considered unreliable because they lack proper estimation of correction factors for visibility bias. In this study, helicopter surveys were conducted to determine surfacing-diving intervals of franciscanas and to estimate availability for aerial platforms. Fifteen hours were flown and 101 groups of 1 to 7 franciscanas were monitored, resulting in a sample of 248 surface-dive cycles. The mean surfacing interval and diving interval times were 16.10 seconds (SE = 9.74) and 39.77 seconds (SE = 29.06), respectively. Availability was estimated at 0.39 (SE = 0.01), a value 16–46% greater than estimates computed from diving parameters obtained from boats or from land. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to investigate the influence of biological and environmental predictors on the proportion of time franciscana groups are visually available to be seen from an aerial platform. These models revealed that group size was the main factor influencing the proportion at surface. The use of negatively biased estimates of availability results in overestimation of abundance, leads to overly optimistic assessments of extinction probabilities and to potentially ineffective management actions. This study demonstrates that estimates of availability must be computed from suitable platforms to ensure proper conservation decisions are implemented to protect threatened species such as the franciscana.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Sucunza, Daniel Danilewicz, Marta Cremer, Artur Andriolo, Alexandre N.

Background &lt;p&gt;Endurance swimming exercises coupled to disinfection by-products exposure has been associated with increased airways dysfunction and neurogenic inflammation in elite swimmers. However, the impact of swimming pool exposure at a recreational level on autonomic activity has never been explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how swimming pool attendance is influencing lung and autonomic function in school-aged children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 858 children enrolled a cross sectional survey. Spirometry and airway reversibility to beta-2 agonist, skin-prick-tests and exhaled nitric oxide measurements were performed. Pupillometry was used to evaluate autonomic nervous function. Children were classified as current swimmers (CS), past swimmers (PS) and non-swimmers (NS), according to the amount of swimming practice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Current swimmers group had significantly lower maximum and average pupil constriction velocities when compared to both PS and NS groups (3.8 and 5.1 vs 3.9 and 5.3 vs 4.0 and 5.4 mm/s, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01, respectively). Moreover, affinity to the beta-2 agonist and levels of exhaled nitric oxide were significantly higher in CS when compared to NS (70 vs 60 mL and 12 vs 10 ppb, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03, respectively). A non-significant trend for a higher risk of asthma, atopic eczema and allergic rhinitis was found with more years of swimming practice, particularly in atopic individuals (β = 1.12, 1.40 and 1.31, respectively). After case-case analysis, it was possible to observe that results were not influenced by the inclusion of individuals with asthma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Concluding, swimming pool attendance appears to be associated with autonomic changes and increased baseline airway smooth muscle constriction even in children without asthma.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by João Cavaleiro Rufo, Inês Paciência, Diana Silva, Carla Martins, Joana Madureira, Eduardo de Oliveira Fernandes, Patrícia Padrão, Pedro Moreira, Luís Delgado, André Moreira&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Since 1946 the controlled human infection model (CHIM) for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; has been used to improve understanding of disease pathogenesis, describe clinical and immunologic responses to infection and as a tool for vaccine development. As the frequency and intent for use in vaccine comparisons increases, standardization of the primary endpoint definition is necessary.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subject-level data were obtained from previously conducted experimental &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM studies. Signs and symptoms severity were categorized consistently across all studies. Sign and symptom correlations were estimated and univariate models were utilized to describe the association between stool output and other &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt;-attributable signs and symptoms. Multiple correspondence and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed to describe the co-occurrence of signs and symptoms. A disease score is proposed based on the co-occurrence of these events.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data were obtained on 54 subjects receiving 800 to 2000 colony forming units (cfu) of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt;. The median maximum 24 hour stool output was 514 ml (IQR: 300, 998 ml) with a median frequency of 6 (IQR: 4, 9). Subjects reported abdominal pain or cramps (81.5%), headache (66.7%) and anorexia (64.8%), 50.0% had a fever and 27.8% had gross blood in multiple loose stools.

We demonstrate that PIPER outperforms state-of-the-art alternative methods on simulated data and is able to predict known key regulators of differentiation on real scRNA-Seq datasets.</content></content></item><item><published>1521172800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00164/20180316/images/medium/bi-2018-00164y_0005.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>159</height><width>500</width></visual><unread>False</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00164/20180316/images/medium/bi-2018-00164y_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00164&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Swarm-founding ‘Warrior wasps’ (&lt;i&gt;Synoeca&lt;/i&gt; spp.) are found throughout the tropical regions of South America, are much feared due to their aggressive nest defence and painful sting. There are only five species of &lt;i&gt;Synoeca&lt;/i&gt;, all construct distinctive nests that consist of a single sessile comb built onto the surface of a tree or rock face, which is covered by a ribbed envelope. Although locally common, research into this group is just starting. We studied eight colonies of &lt;i&gt;Synoeca septentrionalis&lt;/i&gt;, a species recently been described from Brazil. A new colony is established by a swarm of 52 to 140 adults that constructs a colony containing around 200 brood cells. The largest colony collected containing 865 adults and over 1400 cells. The number of queen’s present among the eight colonies varied between 3 and 58 and no clear association between colony development and queen number was detected. Workers and queens were morphologically indistinguishably, but differences in their cuticular hydrocarbons were detected, particularly in their (Z)-9-alkenes. The simple cuticular profile, multiple queens, large size and small number of species makes the ‘Warrior wasps’ an excellent model group for further chemical ecology studies of swarm-founding wasps.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eliaber B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about 11% of Tuberculosis (TB) cases occur in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and it is the leading cause of death in this population. An important step towards reducing the incidence and mortality of TB in PLHIV is to reduce the time from onset of symptoms to treatment. Factors related to TB treatment delay therefore need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with TB at the National Institute of Infectious Disease, at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil we conducted a survival analysis to identify factors associated with patient and health care treatment delay. In our analysis we included patients who were co-infected with TB and HIV (n = 201). Patients were followed during the course of their TB treatment and information regarding duration of symptoms, sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were collected at the baseline visit.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median time from onset of initial symptoms to prescription of TB treatment (total delay) was 82 days. From initiation of symptoms to first visit at INI clinic (patient delay), the median was 51 days. From first visit to initiation of treatment (health care delay) the median was 16 days. Illiteracy was associated with greater patient delay [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.25, CI 95% 1.29–3.94]. Having had a previous episode of TB (HR = 0.53, CI 95% 0.37–0.74) and being married (HR = 0.71, CI 95% 0.54–0.94) were inversely related to patient delay. Illiteracy was also associated with greater health care delay (HR = 2.83, CI 95% 1.25–5.47) in contrast to high viral load (HR = 0.37, CI 95% 0.24–0.54) and weight loss greater than 10% (HR = 0.54, CI 95% 0.37–0.8), both of which were inversely related to health care delay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study highlights the existence of factors that lead to greater risk of delayed treatment of TB among patients co-infected with HIV and TB. These include factors that can be assessed through targeted interventions which have implications for improving treatment outcomes and, through reduced duration of infectiousness, reduce the incidence of TB in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Betânia M.

In eukaryotes, oscillatory dynamics are thought to arise from interactions at the protein and RNA levels; however, the role of non-coding RNA in regulating these dynamics remains understudied. In this work, using a mathematical model, we show how non-coding RNA acting as miRNA sponges in a conserved miRNA - transcription factor feedback motif, can give rise to oscillatory behaviour. Control of these non-coding RNA can dynamically create oscillations or stability, and we show how this behaviour predisposes to oscillations in the stochastic limit. These results point towards novel hypotheses for the roles of different species of miRNA sponges, and help to provide a paradigm for functional differences between the many distinct RNA species thought to act as miRNA sponges in nature.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Oscillations are crucial to the sustenance of living organisms, across a wide variety of biological processes.

In this work, using a mathematical model, we show how non-coding RNA acting as miRNA sponges in a conserved miRNA - transcription factor feedback motif, can give rise to oscillatory behaviour. Control of these non-coding RNA can dynamically create oscillations or stability, and we show how this behaviour predisposes to oscillations in the stochastic limit. These results point towards novel hypotheses for the roles of different species of miRNA sponges, and help to provide a paradigm for functional differences between the many distinct RNA species thought to act as miRNA sponges in nature.</content></content></item><item><published>1522047600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>Single rhodium atoms anchored in micropores for efficient transformation of methane under mild conditions</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03235-7</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16261a10c4d:5957e58:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03235-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/uAA1Ohf1cWU/s41467-018-03235-7</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>f1d7141</fingerprint><author><name>Yu Tang</name></author><crawled>1522056367181</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03235-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single rhodium atoms anchored in micropores for efficient transformation of methane under mild conditions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single rhodium atoms anchored in micropores for efficient transformation of methane under mild conditions, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03235-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03235-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Catalytic transformation of CH4 under mild conditions has implications to shale gas utilization.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) are frequently exposed to computed tomography (CT). Each CT exposes patients to radiation that cumulatively could increase the risk of malignancy, particularly in younger patients. We aim to study the effect of age on CT use in IBD patients seen in the Emergency Department (ED) or the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study of IBD patients identified in Truven Health Marketscan databases between 2009–2013. The main outcome was use of CT during an ED or inpatient visit. Effect of age on CT use was characterized using logistic regression accounting for important covariables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 66,731 patients with IBD with 144,147 ED or inpatient visits in this cohort with a diagnosis code of IBD. At first visit, 5.8% percent were below age 18. CT was utilized in 26.6% of visits. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for medications, recent surgery, and gender, patients 18–35 were more likely to undergo CT (OR 2.35, 95%CI: 2.20–2.52) compared to those &amp;lt;18. Examining patients only between 16 and 19, the odds of an 18 or 19-year-old undergoing CT is significantly higher than a 16 or 17-year-old (OR 1.96, 95%CI: 1.71–2.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with IBD undergo CT more than a quarter of the time in the ED or inpatient setting. Pediatric providers limit radiation exposure among those &amp;lt;18 while adult providers are not as cautious with radiation exposure for the young adult population. Increased awareness of the risks of cumulative radiation exposure in the young adult population is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shail M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have established a correlation between coronary artery calcification (CAC) measured by ECG-gated chest computed tomography (CT) and cardiovascular disease. Recent reports which included asymptomatic patients suggest that CAC measured on non-ECG gated CT is similarly associated with cardiovascular risk. This study investigates the correlation between the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and an incidental finding of CAC on a non-gated chest CT performed for non-cardiac indications in young and seemingly healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study that included 162 CT scans performed in young patients aged 18–50 years old for non-cardiac indications in our institution was conducted. CAC score (CACS) was calculated using the Agatston method. FRS was calculated and compared to the CACS using three different approaches. The correlations between the CACS and several specific factors (i.e. age, body mass index, smoking, statins, etc.), were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of patients was 36.43 year old and 105 (64.8%) were male. We found a significant positive correlation between the CACS and the FRS in all three approaches (p&amp;lt;0.05). Increased age, smoking and statin use were the only individual factors clearly associated with an increase in CACS (p = 0.002, p = 0.045 and p = 0.009, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This is the first report indicating that incidental CACS identified in non-gated MDCT is also associated with cardiovascular risk evaluated by FRS in a young population. Our findings suggest that young asymptomatic individuals with incidental CAC should be seriously evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors despite presumption of belonging to a low cardiovascular risk category.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Lichtenstein, Amichai Perlman, Shoshana Shpitzen, Ronen Durst, Dorit Shaham, Eran Leitersdorf, Auryan Szalat&lt;/p&gt;

Noninvasive detection of both early pancreatic neoplasia and metastases could enhance strategies to improve patient survival in this disease that is notorious for an extremely poor prognosis. There are almost no identifiable targets for non-invasive diagnosis by positron emission tomography (PET) for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Over-expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is found on the cell surface of both pre-neoplastic lesions and invasive PDAC. Here, a RAGE-specific single chain (scFv) was developed, specific for PET imaging in syngeneic mouse models of PDAC. An anti-RAGE scFv conjugated with a sulfo-Cy5 fluorescence molecule showed high affinity and selectivity for RAGE expressing pancreatic tumor cells and genetically engineered KRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12D&lt;/sup&gt; mouse models of PDAC. An &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; biodistribution study was performed with the &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-radiolabled scFv in a syngeneic murine pancreatic cancer model, demonstrating both the feasibility and potential of an anti-RAGE scFv for detection of PDAC. These studies hold great promise for translation into the clinic.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hye-Yeong Kim, Xiaolei Wang, Rui Kang, Daolin Tang, Brian A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Negative workplace behaviour, especially negative communication is a recognised problem in many organisations and is known to have serious impact on workplace performance, productivity and personal wellbeing. Emergency Departments (ED) can be high stress environments in which communication and perceptions of respect between physicians and other staff may underlie individual functioning. We conducted a study to estimate the influence of incivility (ICV) among physicians in the ED.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed an online survey to assess workplace incivility in the ED. We focussed on frequency, origin, reasons and situations where ICV was reported. To measure the levels and the potential influence of ICV on psychological safety, social stress and personal wellbeing we correlated our questionnaire to standard psychological scales. Statistical analysis included Students t-test, chi squared distribution and Pearson correlation coefficient.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We invited all seventy-seven ED physicians to participate in our survey. Among those that completed (n = 50, 65%) the survey, 9% of ED physicians reported frequent (1/week) and 38% occasional (1/month) incidents of ICV. 28% of physicians reported experiencing ICV once per quarter and 21% reported a frequency of only once per year, no physician reported ICV on a daily basis. Levels of ICV were significantly higher in interactions with specialists from outside then within the ED (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).ICV was perceived particularly during critical situations. Our findings showed a significant correlation between internal (within the ED team) ICV and psychological safety. To ED physicians internal ICV was associated with lower levels of psychological safety (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). ICV displayed from sources outside the ED team was not associated with psychological safety, but we found a significant influence of external ICV on personal irritability and reduced wellbeing (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of incivility was high among the ED physicians. Although this was a small sample, the association between workplace ICV and psychological safety, personal irritation as well personal comfort suggests that ICV may be an important variable underlying ED team performance. These findings further underscore the need to foster a culture of respect and good communication between departments, as levels of ICV were highest with physicians from outside the ED. Future research would benefit from examining strategies to prevent and reduce ICV and identify reasons for personal variation in perception of ICV. During critical situations and in general collaboration with specialists, awareness of ICV and countermeasures are important to avoid decreased performance and negative impact on staff and patient.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karsten Klingberg, Khaled Gadelhak, Sabrina N.

Gene regulation at the transcriptional level is a central process in all organisms, and DNA-binding transcription factors, known as TFs, play a fundamental role. This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named “companion domain” (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: i) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA. Based on a classification of the organisms according to the life-styles, a major abundance of regulatory families in free-living organisms, in contrast with pathogenic, extremophilic or intracellular organisms, was identified. Finally, the protein architecture diversity associated to the 19 families considering a weight score for domain promiscuity evidenced which regulatory families were characterized by either a large diversity of CDs, here named as “promiscuous” families given the elevated number of variable domains found in those TFs, or a low diversity of CDs. Altogether this information helped us to understand the diversity and distribution of the 19 Prokaryotes TF families. Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto Perez-Rueda, Rafael Hernandez-Guerrero, Mario Alberto Martinez-Nuñez, Dagoberto Armenta-Medina, Israel Sanchez, J.

We investigated the numbers of planktonic and biofilm cells and the expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps and biofilm-related proteins in 10 clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; (MDRA) as well as in its standard strain ATCC 19606 in the presence of colistin (CST), polymyxin B (PMB), minomycin (MIN), and tigecycline (TGC) at their respective sub-MICs. The number of planktonic and biofilm cells of ATCC 19606 decreased in the presence of all aforementioned antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner. Cell number also decreased in two representative MDRA strains, R2 and R3, in the presence of MIN and TGC in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the number of biofilm cells in these two strains increased in the presence of CST, while they increased significantly in the presence of PMB in R2 only. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the number of biofilm cells was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding efflux pumps (&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;) and autoinducer synthase (&lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt;) in strain R2 and &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeJ&lt;/i&gt;, poly-acetyl-glucosamine-porin (&lt;i&gt;pgaA&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of CST. It was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; in strain R2 and an outer membrane protein A (&lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt;) and biofilm-associated protein (&lt;i&gt;bap)&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of PMB.

In the context of an ageing population, understanding the transmission of infectious diseases such as scabies through well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases. Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods for the integration of the differential equation system, and then select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We test the goodness-of-fit of this model using posterior predictive intervals and propagate forward the resulting parameter uncertainty in a Bayesian framework to consider the economic cost of delayed interventions against scabies, quantifying the benefits of prompt action in the event of detection. We also revisit the previous methodology used to assess the safety of treatments in small population sub-units—in this context ivermectin—and demonstrate that even a very slight relaxation of the implicit assumption of homogeneous death rates significantly increases the plausibility of the hypothesis that ivermectin does not cause excess mortality based upon the data of Barkwell and Shields [1].&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UwFpGqUcNck&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Timothy Kinyanjui, Jo Middleton, Stefan Güttel, Jackie Cassell, Joshua Ross, Thomas House&lt;/p&gt;

Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease. We conducted a scoping review of child growth studies in which length/height, weight or body mass index (BMI) was measured at ≥ 2 time points. From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., ‘weight gain’) and a ‘content signature’, a numeric code that summarized the metric’s conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child’s change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels. In conclusion, the numerous distinct growth metrics and the lack of specificity in the application of metric labels challenge the integration of data and inferences from studies investigating the determinants or consequences of variations in childhood growth.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Leung, Nandita Perumal, Elnathan Mesfin, Aditi Krishna, Seungmi Yang, William Johnson, Diego G.

Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight and the largest animals to ever take wing. The pterosaurs persisted for over 150 million years before disappearing at the end of the Cretaceous, but the patterns of and processes driving their extinction remain unclear. Only a single family, Azhdarchidae, is definitively known from the late Maastrichtian, suggesting a gradual decline in diversity in the Late Cretaceous, with the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction eliminating a few late-surviving species. However, this apparent pattern may simply reflect poor sampling of fossils. Here, we describe a diverse pterosaur assemblage from the late Maastrichtian of Morocco that includes not only Azhdarchidae but the youngest known Pteranodontidae and Nyctosauridae. With 3 families and at least 7 species present, the assemblage represents the most diverse known Late Cretaceous pterosaur assemblage and dramatically increases the diversity of Maastrichtian pterosaurs. At least 3 families—Pteranodontidae, Nyctosauridae, and Azhdarchidae—persisted into the late Maastrichtian. Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs show increased niche occupation relative to earlier, Santonian-Campanian faunas and successfully outcompeted birds at large sizes. These patterns suggest an abrupt mass extinction of pterosaurs at the K-Pg boundary.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ElO4GsSgvdo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas R.

However, being a membrane protein, it is difficult to obtain the 3D crystal structures of GPCRs for virtual screening of ligands by molecular docking. Thus, we evaluated the virtual screening performance of homology models of human GPCRs with respect to the corresponding crystal structures. Among the 19 GPCRs involved in this study, we observed that 10 GPCRs have homology models that have better or comparable performance with respect to the corresponding X-ray structures, making homology models a viable choice for virtual screening. For a small subset of GPCRs, we also explored how certain methods like consensus enrichment and sidechain perturbation affect the utility of homology models in virtual screening, as well as the selectivity between agonists and antagonists. Most notably, consensus enrichment across multiple homology models often yields results comparable to the best performing model, suggesting that ligand candidates predicted with consensus scores from multiple models can be the optimal option in practical applications where X-ray structure is not available and the performance of each model cannot be estimated.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is an important target class of proteins for drug discovery, with over 27% of FDA-approved drugs targeting GPCRs.

Among the 19 GPCRs involved in this study, we observed that 10 GPCRs have homology models that have better or comparable performance with respect to the corresponding X-ray structures, making homology models a viable choice for virtual screening. For a small subset of GPCRs, we also explored how certain methods like consensus enrichment and sidechain perturbation affect the utility of homology models in virtual screening, as well as the selectivity between agonists and antagonists. Most notably, consensus enrichment across multiple homology models often yields results comparable to the best performing model, suggesting that ligand candidates predicted with consensus scores from multiple models can be the optimal option in practical applications where X-ray structure is not available and the performance of each model cannot be estimated.</content></content></item><item><published>1521135592000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Zhang &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.

Supplying food for the anticipated global population of over 9 billion in 2050 under changing climate conditions is one of the major challenges of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Agricultural expansion and intensification contributes to global environmental change and risks the long-term sustainability of the planet. It has been proposed that no more than 15% of the global ice-free land surface should be converted to cropland. Bioenergy production for land-based climate mitigation places additional pressure on limited land resources. Here we test normative targets of food supply and bioenergy production within the cropland planetary boundary using a global land-use model. The results suggest supplying the global population with adequate food is possible without cropland expansion exceeding the planetary boundary. Yet this requires an increase in food production, especially in developing countries, as well as a decrease in global crop yield gaps. However, under current assumptions of future food requirements, it was not possible to also produce significant amounts of first generation bioenergy without cropland expansion. These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by R.

Explicit structural inference is one key point to improve the accuracy of scene parsing. Meanwhile, adversarial training method is able to reinforce spatial contiguity in output segmentations. To take both advantages of the structural learning and adversarial training simultaneously, we propose a novel deep learning network architecture called Structural Inference Embedded Adversarial Networks (SIEANs) for pixel-wise scene labeling. The generator of our SIEANs, a novel designed scene parsing network, makes full use of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks to learn the global contextual information of objects in four different directions from RGB-(D) images, which is able to describe the (three-dimensional) spatial distributions of objects in a more comprehensive and accurate way. To further improve the performance, we explore the adversarial training method to optimize the generator along with a discriminator, which can not only detect and correct higher-order inconsistencies between the predicted segmentations and corresponding ground truths, but also exploit full advantages of the generator by fine-tuning its parameters so as to obtain higher consistencies. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SIEANs is able to achieve a better performance on PASCAL VOC 2012, SIFT FLOW, PASCAL Person-Part, Cityscapes, Stanford Background, NYUDv2, and SUN-RGBD datasets compared to the most of state-of-the-art methods.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by ZeYu Wang, YanXia Wu, ShuHui Bu, PengCheng Han, GuoYin Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Agricultural crops play an important role in the global carbon and water cycle. Global climate change scenarios predict enhanced water scarcity and altered precipitation pattern in many parts of the world. Hence, a mechanistic understanding of water fluxes, productivity and water use efficiency of cultivated crops is of major importance, i.e. to adapt management practices. We compared water and carbon fluxes of paddy and rainfed rice by canopy scale gas exchange measurements, crop growth, daily evapotranspiration, transpiration and carbon flux modeling. Throughout a monsoon rice growing season, soil evaporation in paddy rice contributed strongly to evapotranspiration (96.6% to 43.3% from initial growth to fully developed canopy and amounted to 57.9% of total water losses over the growing seasons. Evaporation of rainfed rice was significantly lower (by 65% on average) particularly before canopy closure. Water use efficiency (WUE) was significantly higher in rainfed rice both from an agronomic (WUE&lt;sub&gt;agro&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. grain yield per evapotranspiration) and ecosystem (WUE&lt;sub&gt;eco&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. gross primary production per evapotranspiration) perspective. However, our results also show that higher WUE in rainfed rice comes at the expense of higher respiration losses compared to paddy rice (26% higher on average). Hence, suggestions on water management depend on the regional water availability (i.e. Mediterranean vs. Monsoon climate) and the balance between higher respiratory losses versus a potential reduction in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that a shift from rainfed/unsaturated soil to waterlogged paddy conditions after closure of the rice canopy might be a good compromise towards a sustainable use of water while preserving grain yield, particularly for water-limited production areas.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bhone Nay‐Htoon, Wei Xue, Steve Lindner, Matthias Cuntz, Jonghan Ko, John Tenhunen, Christiane Werner, Maren Dubbert&lt;/p&gt;

PSG formation and concomitant protection against proteaphagy also occurs in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that PSGs represent an evolutionarily conserved cache of proteasomes that can be rapidly re-mobilized based on energy availability.</description><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Cell Biology</item></keywords></item><item><published>1522393200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162764edef1:7865ba6:34f43e70</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/puX5ZdDFh2A/ncomms16207</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>3a769985</fingerprint><author><name>Vasilica Nache</name></author><crawled>1522403303153</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16207&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/puX5ZdDFh2A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16207&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/ncomms16207&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Hysteresis of ligand binding in CNGA2 ion channels&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/puX5ZdDFh2A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522134000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>Ikaros family zinc finger 1 regulates dendritic cell development and function in humans</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02977-8</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16266ca108a:601b6e3:34f43e70</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02977-8</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/J-xaNW7iFoY/s41467-018-02977-8</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>78dad2b7</fingerprint><author><name>Urszula Cytlak</name></author><crawled>1522142941322</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02977-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ikaros family zinc finger 1 regulates dendritic cell development and function in humans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ikaros family zinc finger 1 regulates dendritic cell development and function in humans, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02977-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-02977-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;IKZF1 is a transcription factor known to regulate mammalian B-cell development.

Spinal motoneurones (Mns) constitute the final output for the execution of motor tasks. In addition to innervating muscles, Mns project excitatory collateral connections to Renshaw cells (RCs) and other Mns, but the latter have received little attention. We show that Mns receive strong synaptic input from other Mns throughout development and into maturity, with fast-type Mns systematically receiving greater recurrent excitation than slow-type Mns. Optical recordings show that activation of Mns in one spinal segment can propagate to adjacent segments even in the presence of intact recurrent inhibition. While it is known that transmission at the neuromuscular junction is purely cholinergic and RCs are excited through both acetylcholine and glutamate receptors, here we show that neurotransmission between Mns is purely glutamatergic, indicating that synaptic transmission systems are differentiated at different postsynaptic targets of Mns.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8cEYlJIEZjs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gardave S.

We have previously shown that low frequency ultrasound can release biomarkers from cells into the murine circulation enabling an amplification and localization of the released biomarker that could be used as a blood-based method to detect cancer earlier and monitor therapy. In this study, we further demonstrate that this technique could be used for characterization of tumors and/or identification of cellular masses of unknown origin due to the release of multiple protein and nucleic acid biomarkers in cells in culture, mice and patients. We sonicated colon (LS174T) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cell lines in culture at a low frequency of 1 MHz and show that there were several-fold changes in multiple protein and microRNA (miRNA) abundance with treatment at various intensities and time. This release was dependent on the duration and intensity of the sonication for both cell lines. Significant increased release in biomarkers was also observed following tumor sonication in living mice bearing subcutaneous LS174T cell line xenografts (for proteins and nucleic acids) and in an experimental LS174T liver tumor model (for proteins only). Finally, we demonstrated this methodology of multiple biomarker release in patients undergoing ablation of uterine fibroids using MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound. Two protein biomarkers significantly increased in the plasma after the ultrasound treatment in 21 samples tested. This proof that ultrasound-amplification method works in soft tissue tumor models together with biomarker multiplexing, could allow for an effective non-invasive method for identification, characterization and localization of incidental lesions, cancer and other disease. Pre-treatment quantification of the biomarkers, allows for individualization of quantitative comparisons. This individualization of normal marker levels in this method allows for specificity of the biomarker-increase to each patient, tumor or organ being studied.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aloma L.

Mosquitoes function as important vectors for many diseases globally and can have substantial negative economic, environmental, and health impacts. Specifically, West Nile virus (WNv) is a significant and increasing threat to wildlife populations and human health throughout North America. Mosquito control is an important means of controlling the spread of WNv, as the virus is primarily spread between avian and mosquito vectors. This is of particular concern for avian host species such as the Greater sage-grouse (&lt;i&gt;Centrocercus urophasianus&lt;/i&gt;), in which WNv negatively impacts fitness parameters. Most mosquito control methods focus on the larval stages. In North America, control efforts are largely limited to larvicides, which require repeated application and have potentially negative ecological impacts. There are multiple potential advantages to using indigenous fish species as an alternative for larval control including lowered environmental impact, decreased costs in terms of time and financial inputs, and the potential for the establishment of self-sustaining fish populations. We tested the efficacy of using fathead minnows (&lt;i&gt;Pimephales promelas&lt;/i&gt;) as biological control for mosquito populations in livestock reservoirs of semiarid rangelands. We introduced minnows into 10 treatment reservoirs and monitored an additional 6 non-treated reservoirs as controls over 3 years. Adult mosquitoes of species known to transmit WNv (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Culex tarsalis&lt;/i&gt;) were captured at each site and mosquito larvae were also present at all sites. Stable isotope analysis confirmed that introduced fathead minnows were feeding at the mosquito larvae trophic level in all but one treatment pond. Treatment ponds demonstrated suppressed levels of mosquito larva over each season compared to controls with a model-predicted 114% decrease in larva density within treatment ponds. Minnows established self-sustaining populations throughout the study in all reservoirs that maintained sufficient water levels. Minnow survival was not influenced by water quality. Though minnows did not completely eradicate mosquito larvae, minnows are a promising alternative to controlling mosquito larvae density within reservoirs. We caution that careful site selection is critical to avoid potential negative impacts, but suggest the introduction of fathead minnows in reservoirs can dramatically reduce mosquito larva abundance and potentially help mitigate vector-borne disease transmission.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryan T.

Mosquitoes function as important vectors for many diseases globally and can have substantial negative economic, environmental, and health impacts. Specifically, West Nile virus (WNv) is a significant and increasing threat to wildlife populations and human health throughout North America. Mosquito control is an important means of controlling the spread of WNv, as the virus is primarily spread between avian and mosquito vectors. This is of particular concern for avian host species such as the Greater sage-grouse (&lt;i&gt;Centrocercus urophasianus&lt;/i&gt;), in which WNv negatively impacts fitness parameters. Most mosquito control methods focus on the larval stages. In North America, control efforts are largely limited to larvicides, which require repeated application and have potentially negative ecological impacts.

Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in sheep and an example of a disease that may be controlled through breeding for disease resistance. Member states of the European Union have introduced strategies for breeding against scrapie based on the selection of genetically resistant breeding rams. An ambitious strategy adopted in The Netherlands consisted of selecting resistant rams for breeding throughout both breeding and production sectors. Mathematical modelling of the effect of a breeding program on the spreading capacity of scrapie in a national flock is needed for making assessments on how long a breeding strategy needs to be maintained to achieve disease control. Here we describe such a model applied to the Dutch situation, with the use of data on the genetic content of the Dutch sheep population as well as on scrapie occurrence in this population. We show that the time needed for obtaining scrapie control depends crucially on two parameters measuring sheep population structure: the between-flock heterogeneity in genotype frequencies, and the heterogeneity of mixing (contact rates) between sheep flocks. Estimating the first parameter from Dutch genetic survey data and assuming scenario values for the second one, enables model prediction of the time needed to achieve scrapie control in The Netherlands.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas J.

Fossils entombed in amber are a unique resource for reconstructing forest ecosystems, and resolving relationships of modern taxa. Such fossils are famous for their perfect, life-like appearance. However, preservation quality is vast with many sites showing only cuticular preservation, or no fossils. The taphonomic processes that control this range are largely unknown; as such, we know little about potential bias in this important record. Here we employ actualistic experiments, using, fruit flies and modern tree resin to determine whether resin type, gut microbiota, and dehydration prior to entombment affects decay. We used solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) to confirm distinct tree resin chemistry; gut microbiota of flies was modified using antibiotics and categorized though sequencing. Decay was assessed using phase contrast synchrotron tomography. Resin type demonstrates a significant control on decay rate. The composition of the gut microbiota was also influential, with minor changes in composition affecting decay rate. Dehydration prior to entombment, contrary to expectations, enhanced decay. Our analyses show that there is potential significant bias in the amber fossil record, especially between sites with different resin types where ecological completeness and preservational fidelity are likely affected.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Victoria E.

For organisms with complex life histories, carry-over effects (COEs) can manifest between life stages, when conditions experienced by one stage influence the next, as well as trans-generationally, when the parental environment affects offspring. Here we used multiple global change-associated stressors to examine both forms of COE simultaneously in an intertidal limpet with mixed development (i.e. planktonic larvae hatch from benthic egg masses). Adult &lt;i&gt;Siphonaria australis&lt;/i&gt; were subjected to four treatments over four weeks: an ambient control, a treatment featuring elevated water temperature (25°C) and UVB (1.7 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;), a copper pollution treatment (5.0 μg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and a treatment incorporating all three stressors. Egg masses laid by these adults were then redistributed among the same four treatments (producing 16 adult-to-egg treatment histories) and stressed until hatching. Finally, hatching larvae were reared under ambient conditions for 24 days. While adult survivorship was unaffected by treatment, embryonic viability in egg masses responded strongly to egg mass treatment, as well as parental stress exposure, therefore displaying trans-generational COEs. These trans-generational COEs interacted with COEs originating in egg masses to produce highly context-dependent hatching sizes and larval growth. This demonstrates that the performance of a given organism at a given time reflects not only conditions experienced during embryonic development, but also those of the parental generation, and suggests that COEs play an important but underestimated role in responses to global change scenarios.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gustav M.

However, less is known about the upstream regulators of the RPs. Here we identify SPIN1 (Spindlin 1) as a novel binding partner of human RPL5/uL18 that is important for this pathway. SPIN1 ablation activates p53, suppresses cell growth, reduces clonogenic ability, and induces apoptosis of human cancer cells. Mechanistically, SPIN1 sequesters uL18 in the nucleolus, preventing it from interacting with MDM2, and thereby alleviating uL18-mediated inhibition of MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity towards p53. SPIN1 deficiency increases ribosome-free uL18 and uL5 (human RPL11), which are required for SPIN1 depletion-induced p53 activation.

However, less is known about the upstream regulators of the RPs. Here we identify SPIN1 (Spindlin 1) as a novel binding partner of human RPL5/uL18 that is important for this pathway. SPIN1 ablation activates p53, suppresses cell growth, reduces clonogenic ability, and induces apoptosis of human cancer cells. Mechanistically, SPIN1 sequesters uL18 in the nucleolus, preventing it from interacting with MDM2, and thereby alleviating uL18-mediated inhibition of MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity towards p53. SPIN1 deficiency increases ribosome-free uL18 and uL5 (human RPL11), which are required for SPIN1 depletion-induced p53 activation. Analysis of cancer genomic databases suggests that SPIN1 is highly expressed in several human cancers, and its overexpression is positively correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Altogether, our findings reveal that the oncogenic property of SPIN1 may be attributed to its negative regulation of uL18, leading to p53 inactivation.</description><keywords><item>Cancer Biology</item></keywords></item><item><published>1523246400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00106/20180409/images/medium/mp-2018-00106z_0009.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>458</height><width>500</width></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00106/20180409/images/medium/mp-2018-00106z_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00106&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Polyploidization has played an important role in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly at the base of Teleostei–an enormously successful ray-finned fish group with additional genome doublings on lower taxonomic levels. The investigation of post-polyploid genome dynamics might provide important clues about the evolution and ecology of respective species and can help to decipher the role of polyploidy &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on speciation. Few studies have attempted to investigate the dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences in the post-polyploid genome using molecular cytogenetic tools in fishes, though recent efforts demonstrated their usefulness. The demonstrably monophyletic freshwater loach family Botiidae, branching to evolutionary diploid and tetraploid lineages separated &gt;25 Mya, offers a suited model group for comparing the long-term repetitive DNA evolution. For this, we integrated phylogenetic analyses with cytogenetical survey involving Giemsa- and Chromomycin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/DAPI stainings and fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization with 5S/45S rDNA, U2 snDNA and telomeric probes in representative sample of 12 botiid species.
The karyotypes of all diploids were composed of 2n = 50 chromosomes, while majority of tetraploids had 2n = 4x = 100, with only subtle interspecific karyotype differences. The exceptional karyotype of &lt;i&gt;Botia dario&lt;/i&gt; (2n = 4x = 96) suggested centric fusions behind the 2n reduction. Variable patterns of FISH signals revealed cases of intraspecific polymorphisms, rDNA amplification, variable degree of correspondence with CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and almost no phylogenetic signal. In tetraploids, either additivity or loci gain/loss was recorded. Despite absence of classical interstitial telomeric sites, large blocks of interspersed rDNA/telomeric regions were found in diploids only.
We uncovered different molecular drives of studied repetitive DNA classes within botiid genomes as well as the advanced stage of the re-diploidization process in tetraploids. Our results may contribute to link genomic approach with molecular cytogenetic analyses in addressing the origin and mechanism of this polyploidization event.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandr Sember, Jörg Bohlen, Vendula Šlechtová, Marie Altmanová, Šárka Pelikánová, Petr Ráb&lt;/p&gt;

Recent studies have demonstrated how the competition for the finite pool of available gene expression factors has important effect on fundamental gene expression aspects. In this study, based on a whole-cell model simulation of translation in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, we evaluate for the first time the expected effect of mRNA levels fluctuations on translation due to the finite pool of ribosomes. We show that fluctuations of a single gene or a group of genes mRNA levels induce periodic behavior in all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; translation factors and aspects: the ribosomal densities and the translation rates of all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs oscillate. We numerically measure the oscillation amplitudes demonstrating that fluctuations of endogenous and heterologous genes can cause a significant fluctuation of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of the rest of the genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by synonymous mutations that oscillating the levels of mRNAs that experience high ribosomal occupancy (e.g. ribosomal “traffic jam”) induces the largest impact on the translation of the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; genome.
The results reported here should provide novel insights and principles related to the design of synthetic gene expression circuits and related to the evolutionary constraints shaping gene expression of endogenous genes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EeyF-2L0x-k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yoram Zarai, Tamir Tuller&lt;/p&gt;

Open-cut coal mining in Queensland results in the formation of extensive saline overburden spoil-piles with steep slopes at the angle of repose (approximately 75% or 37&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;). These spoil-piles are generally found in multiple rows, several kilometers in length and heights of up to 50 or 60 m above the original landscape. They are highly dispersive and erodible. Legislation demands that these spoil piles be rehabilitated to minimize on-site and off-site discharges of sediment and salt into the surrounding environment. To achieve this, the steep slopes must be reduced, stabilized against erosion, covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. Key design criteria (slope gradient, slope length and vegetation cover) are required for the construction of post-mining landscapes that will result in acceptable erosion rates.
A novel user-friendly hillslope computer model MINErosion 3.4 was developed that can accurately predict potential erosion rates from field scale hillslopes using parameters measured with a 3m laboratory tilting flume-rainfall simulator or using routinely measured soil physical and chemical properties. This model links MINErosion 2 with a novel consolidation and above ground vegetation cover factors, to the RUSLE and MUSLE equations to predict the mean annual and storm event erosion rates. The RUSLE-based prediction of the mean annual erosion rates allow minesites to derive the key design criteria of slope length, slope gradient and vegetation cover that would lead to acceptable erosion rates. The MUSLE-based prediction of storm event erosion rates will be useful as input into risk analysis of potential damage from erosion.
MINErosion 3.4 was validated against erosion measured on 20 m field erosion plots established on post-mining landscapes at the Oakey Creek and Curragh coalmines, as well as on 120 and 70 m erosion plots on postmining landscapes at Kidston Gold Mine.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hwat Bing So, Ashraf M.

MINErosion 3.4 was validated against erosion measured on 20 m field erosion plots established on post-mining landscapes at the Oakey Creek and Curragh coalmines, as well as on 120 and 70 m erosion plots on postmining landscapes at Kidston Gold Mine.</content></content></item><item><published>1522168914000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Detection of amyloid fibrils in Parkinson’s disease using plasmonic chirality [Applied Physical Sciences]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3225.short?rss=1</originId><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:6352291:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3225</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3225.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>5c9d621a</fingerprint><author><name>Jatish Kumar, Hasier Erana, Elena Lopez–Martinez, Nathalie Claes, Victor F.

Although significant attention has been devoted to analyzing stigma associated with epilepsy, there is still a significant lack of valid and reliable instruments. We aimed to validate the 23-item Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE; originally developed in Brazil), which has been used to evaluate epilepsy-related stigma in the general population. Verification of the SSE questionnaire was carried out in a group of 207 students aged 15–18 years of whom none had epilepsy. These students completed the SSE twice in a period of 3–6 months as part of standard test-retest evaluation practice. The instrument exhibits good psychometric properties including internal consistency higher than in the original version (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.856 here compared with 0.81 reported in Brazil) and acceptable test-retest reliability. Using exploratory factor analysis (not provided for the original version), four factors were identified and corresponding subscales were described and interpreted. Two items did not fit into the structure and were eliminated. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to propose and verify the hierarchical 4-factor structure of the Czech version of SSE confirming the existence of a common factor corresponding to stigma. The results showed that the Czech version of SSE has good psychometric properties and can be used in further research and clinical practice.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dana Brabcová, Jiří Kohout, Daniel Potužák, Barbora Beňová, Pavel Kršek&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of learning and memory impairments remains a challenge. Recent investigations have shown that the activation of group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) in cultured hippocampal neurons by application of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) causes the regulated internalization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which subsequently activates protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Through phosphorylating the C-terminals of the NMDAR GluN2 subunits, PKD1 down-regulates the activity of remaining (non-internalized) surface NMDARs. The knockdown of PKD1 does not affect the DHPG-induced inhibition of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) but prevents the DHPG-induced inhibition of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, we investigated the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effects of bilateral infusions of DHPG into the hippocampal CA1 area of rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object discrimination (NOD) tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 300 adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250–280 g) were used for behavioral tests. One hundred ninety four were used in MWM test and the other 106 rats in the NOD test. Following one week of habituation to the vivarium, rats were bilaterally implanted under deep anesthesia with cannulas aimed at the CA1 area of the hippocampus (CA1 coordinates in mm from Bregma: AP -3.14; lateral +/-2; DV -3.0). Through implanted cannulas artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), the group1 mGluR antagonist 6-Methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, or the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673 were infused into the bilateral hippocampal CA1 areas (2 μL per side, over 5 min). The effects of these infusions and the effects of PKD1 knockdown were examined in MWM or NOD test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;DHPG infusion increased the latency to reach the platform in the MWM test and reduced the preference for the novel object in the NOD task. We found that the DHPG effects were dose-dependent and could be maintained for up to 2 days. Notably, these effects could be prevented by pre-infusion of the group1 mGluR antagonist MPEP, the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673, or by PKD1 knockdown in the hippocampal CA1 area.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Altogether, these findings provide direct evidence that PKD1-mediated signaling may play a critical role in the induction of learning and memory impairments by DHPG infusion into the hippocampal CA1 area.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wang, Florian Duclot, Bradley R.

Douchi has been consumed as a flavoring ingredient for centuries. During production of douchi, numerous microorganisms play important roles in the hydrolysis and conversion of proteins and starch, which are related to the quality and flavor of the end product. Therefore, in the present study, the microbial diversity in two types of home-made traditional bacterial douchi from Gansu province in northwest China was studied by high-throughput sequencing, and a corresponding analysis of the bacterial and fungal communities were conducted. The results showed that geography may have impacted the fungal diversity and the bacterial and fungal species richness in the samples. The results also showed that the microbial community was significantly different in samples of different origin and the difference in the microbial community at the genus level was greater than at phylum level. Two dominant bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ignatzschineria&lt;/i&gt;) were common to the two samples, both of which had a relative abundance of more than 1%. Four bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aerococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Jeotgalicoccus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Qingyang, while another four (&lt;i&gt;Carnobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aneurinibacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Longnan. Two dominant fungal genera (&lt;i&gt;Pichia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;) were shared by the two samples. Additionally, two genera (&lt;i&gt;Rhodosporidium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Yarrowia&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in samples from Longnan. The functional genes of the bacteria present in samples indicated that a significant difference was observed in the bacterial community between samples of different origin. We also found that microbial interactions between bacterial and fungal communities in the samples were very complex. This study provides previously unknown information regarding the impact of the environment on microbial communities in douchi and lays a foundation for further investigations into food ecology in bacterial douchi.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Weibing Zhang, Qiaoqiao Luo, Yan Zhu, Jiang Ma, Lei Cao, Min Yang, Pencheng Wen, Zhongmin Zhang, Xiaoling He&lt;/p&gt;

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world. Although optimal medical care and treatment is widely available, the prognosis of patients with HF is still poor.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important compartments of the innate immunity. Current studies have identified TLRs as critical mediators in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of TLRs and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) in different experimental HF models including viral myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, we investigated for the first time comprehensive TLR and IRF gene and protein expression under basal conditions in murine and human cardiac tissue. We found that &lt;i&gt;Tlr4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; displayed highest gene expression under basal conditions, indicating their significant role in first-line defense in the murine and human heart. Moreover, induction of TLRs and IRFs clearly differs between the various experimental HF models of diverse etiology and the concomitant inflammatory status. In the HF model of acute viral-induced myocarditis, TLR and IRF activation displayed the uppermost gene expression in comparison to the remaining experimental HF models, indicating the highest amount of myocardial inflammation in myocarditis. In detail, &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; displayed by far the highest gene expression during acute viral infection. Interestingly, post myocardial infarction TLR and IRF gene expression was almost exclusively increased in the infarct zone after myocardial ischemia (&lt;i&gt;Tlr2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Irf3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt;). With one exception, &lt;i&gt;Irf3&lt;/i&gt; showed a decreased gene expression in the remote zone post infarction. Finally, we identified &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; as novel cardiovascular stress-inducible factor in the pathologically stressed heart. These findings on TLR and IRF function in the inflamed heart highlight the complexity of inflammatory immune response and raise more interesting questions for future investigation.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Moritz Becher, Svenja Hinrichs, Nina Fluschnik, Jan K.

A temporal latency code represents odor identity in olfactory bulb (OB), but this temporal information is discarded in piriform cortex (PCx) where odor identity is instead encoded through ensemble membership. We developed a spiking PCx network model to understand how this transformation is implemented. In the model, the impact of OB inputs activated earliest after inhalation is amplified within PCx by diffuse recurrent collateral excitation, which then recruits strong, sustained feedback inhibition that suppresses the impact of later-responding glomeruli.

A temporal latency code represents odor identity in olfactory bulb (OB), but this temporal information is discarded in piriform cortex (PCx) where odor identity is instead encoded through ensemble membership. We developed a spiking PCx network model to understand how this transformation is implemented. In the model, the impact of OB inputs activated earliest after inhalation is amplified within PCx by diffuse recurrent collateral excitation, which then recruits strong, sustained feedback inhibition that suppresses the impact of later-responding glomeruli. We model increasing odor concentrations by decreasing glomerulus onset latencies while preserving their activation sequences. This produces a multiplexed cortical odor code in which activated ensembles are robust to concentration changes while concentration information is encoded through population synchrony. Our model demonstrates how PCx circuitry can implement multiplexed ensemble-identity/temporal-concentration odor coding.</description><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords></item><item><published>1523566800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195765</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c5:9f3b30f2</id><title>Bilateral carotid artery stenosis causes unexpected early changes in brain extracellular matrix and blood-brain barrier integrity in mice</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195765</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>a5fc01f</fingerprint><author><name>Jill M.

Bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) is one experimental model of vascular dementia thought to preferentially impact brain white matter. Indeed, few studies report hippocampal and cortical pathology prior to 30 days post-stenosis; though it is unclear whether those studies examined regions outside the white matter. Since changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability precede more overt brain pathology in various diseases, we hypothesized that changes within the BBB and/or BBB-associated extracellular matrix (ECM) could occur earlier after BCAS in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum and be a precursor of longer term pathology. Here, C57Bl/6 mice underwent BCAS or sham surgeries and changes in the BBB and ECM were analyzed by collagen IV (vascular basement membrane component), α5 integrin (marker of endothelial activation), claudin-5 and occludin (tight junction proteins), Evans blue (permeability marker), Ki-67 (cell proliferation marker), and GFAP and CD11b (glial cell markers) immunohistochemistry after 14 days. Significant changes in markers of cerebrovascular integrity and glial activation were detected, not only in the striatum, but also in the hippocampus and cortex. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that changes in the BBB/ECM occur shortly after BCAS and within multiple brain regions and suggests such changes might underlie the gradual development of BCAS non-white matter pathology.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jill M.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over motor cortex and trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) modulate corticospinal circuits in healthy and injured subjects. However, their associated effects with physical exercise is still not defined. This study aimed to investigate the effect of three different settings of rTMS and tsDCS combined with treadmill exercise on spinal cord and cortical excitability of healthy subjects. We performed a triple blind, randomized, sham-controlled crossover study with 12 healthy volunteers who underwent single sessions of rTMS (1Hz, 20Hz and Sham) and tsDCS (anodal, cathodal and Sham) associated with 20 minutes of treadmill walking. Cortical excitability was assessed by motor evoked potential (MEP) and spinal cord excitability by the Hoffmann reflex (Hr), nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) and homosynaptic depression (HD). All measures were assessed before, immediately, 30 and 60 minutes after the experimental procedures. Our results demonstrated that anodal tsDCS/treadmill exercise reduced MEP’s amplitude and NFR’s area compared to sham condition, conversely, cathodal tsDCS/treadmill exercise increased NFR’s area. High-frequency rTMS increased MEP’s amplitude and NFR’s area compared to sham condition. Anodal tsDCS/treadmill exercise and 20Hz rTMS/treadmill exercise reduced Hr amplitude up to 30 minutes after stimulation offset and no changes were observed in HD measures. We demonstrated that tsDCS and rTMS combined with treadmill exercise modulated cortical and spinal cord excitability through different mechanisms. tsDCS modulated spinal reflexes in a polarity-dependent way acting at local spinal circuits while rTMS probably promoted changes in the presynaptic inhibition of spinal motoneurons. In addition, the association of two neuromodulatory techniques induced long-lasting changes.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Plínio Luna Albuquerque, Mayara Campêlo, Thyciane Mendonça, Luís Augusto Mendes Fontes, Rodrigo de Mattos Brito, Katia Monte-Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Increasing use of factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors necessitates effective reversal agents to manage bleeding. Andexanet alfa, a novel modified recombinant human FXa, rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct and indirect FXa inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the ability of andexanet to reverse anticoagulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and reduce bleeding in rabbits administered edoxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies characterized the interaction of andexanet with edoxaban and its ability to reverse edoxaban-mediated anti-FXa activity. In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa. Andexanet rapidly and dose-dependently reversed the effects of edoxaban on FXa activity and coagulation pharmacodynamic parameters &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In edoxaban-anticoagulated rabbits, andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity by 82% (from 548±87 to 100±41 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), mean unbound edoxaban plasma concentration by ~80% (from 100±10 to 21±6 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), and blood loss by 80% vs. vehicle (adjusted for control, 2.6 vs. 12.9 g; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). The reduction in blood loss correlated with the decrease in anti-FXa activity (r = 0.6993, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and unbound edoxaban (r = 0.5951, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0035).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that andexanet rapidly reversed the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban, suggesting it could be clinically valuable for the management of acute and surgery-related bleeding.

Correlation of blood loss with anti-FXa activity supports the use of anti-FXa activity as a biomarker for assessing anticoagulation reversal in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521086400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00625/20180309/images/medium/oc-2017-00625j_0007.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>197</height><width>500</width></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00625/20180309/images/medium/oc-2017-00625j_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.7b00625&lt;/div&gt;</content></summary><title>[ASAP] Increasing Elasticity through Changes in the Secondary Structure of Gelatin by Gelation in a Microsized Lipid Space</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_1622aabc1fb:b58631:76251cdd</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00625</originId><recrawled>1521570583293</recrawled><fingerprint>8e35cc6e</fingerprint><author><name>Atsushi Sakai, Yoshihiro Murayama, Kei Fujiwara, Takahiro Fujisawa, Saori Sasaki, Satoru Kidoaki, Miho Yanagisawa</name></author><crawled>1521134322171</crawled><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00625</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00625/20180309/images/medium/oc-2017-00625j_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.7b00625&lt;/div&gt;</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00625</href></item></alternate></item><item><published>1522950073000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) rely on capsid-associated tegument complex (CATC) for long-range axonal transport of their genome-containing capsids between sites of infection and neuronal cell bodies.

Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;

Presently, third generation sequencing platforms able to generate much longer reads are becoming more widespread. These platforms come with the significant drawback of higher sequencing error rates, which makes them ill-suited to current genotyping algorithms. However, the longer reads make more of the genome unambiguously mappable and typically provide linkage information between neighboring variants. Results: In this paper we introduce a novel approach for haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads. We do this by considering bipartitions of the sequencing reads, corresponding to the two haplotypes. We formalize the computational problem in terms of a Hidden Markov Model and compute posterior genotype probabilities using the forward-backward algorithm. Genotype predictions can then be made by picking the most likely genotype at each site. Our experiments indicate that longer reads allow significantly more of the genome to potentially be accurately genotyped.

Presently, third generation sequencing platforms able to generate much longer reads are becoming more widespread.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) often experience abnormal facial growth. Three-dimensional (3D) assessment of dentofacial growth deviation has become more common with advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies. However, no standardized guidelines exist for interpretation of 3D imaging in patients with JIA. The aim of this study was to propose and validate morphometric measures for the 3D radiographic assessment of dentofacial growth deviation in patients with JIA to enhance: 1) Description of dentofacial growth deviation; 2) Treatment planning; 3) Longitudinal follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in a standardized sequential-phased approach involving: 1) Preliminary decision-making; 2) Item generation; 3) Test of content-validity; 4) Test of reliability; 5) Test of construct validity; 6) Establishment of final recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one morphometric measures were evaluated.

The aim of this study is to disclose the potential bioactive components of &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, a native parasitic natural plant of flora palaestina and to open direction towards new prospective application. GC-MS analysis identified 18 components in the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. The most appealing among them are Sesamin and two other phytosterols (Campesterol and Stigmasterol), all of which are documented in the scientific literature for their anticancer activity. Quantitation of Sesamin extracted from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; by HPLC-PDA with the use of three organic solvents showed that the Sesamin content in the methanolic extract was the highest. Following the disclosure of Sesamin presence in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, we raised the question of whether it is produced naturally in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; or acquired from the host plant. The quantitation of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; was performed while being with five different host plants, and was compared with the amount of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; grown alone. The findings reveal that Sesamin is an endogenous secondary metabolite in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, further studies are required to prove if &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; can be used as an alternative source of anticancer phytochemicals, mainly Sesamin, and if proteins in the Sesamin production pathway could be valid biological targets for the development of novel and selective pesticides for control/ eradication of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; and maybe some other &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta&lt;/i&gt; species. As well, the findings from this study raise a big question of whether inferring Sesamin production in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; could reduce its attack ability to host plants.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Saleh Abu-Lafi, Sadam Makhamra, Ibrahim Rayan, Waseim Barriah, Ahmed Nasser, Basheer Abu Farkh, Anwar Rayan&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, further studies are required to prove if &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; can be used as an alternative source of anticancer phytochemicals, mainly Sesamin, and if proteins in the Sesamin production pathway could be valid biological targets for the development of novel and selective pesticides for control/ eradication of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; and maybe some other &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta&lt;/i&gt; species. As well, the findings from this study raise a big question of whether inferring Sesamin production in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; could reduce its attack ability to host plants.</content></content></item><item><published>1523386901000</published><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>ANTHROPOLOGY, SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE Correction for “Holocene fluctuations in human population demonstrate repeated links to food production and climate,” by Andrew Bevan, Sue Colledge, Dorian Fuller, Ralph Fyfe, Stephen Shennan, and Chris Stevens, which was first published November 20, 2017; 10.1073/pnas.1709190114 (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 114:E10524–E10531).

Our research reveals dynamic 3D space coding in a freely moving mammal engaged in a real-world navigation task.</description><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords></item><item><published>1522737998000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Effects of dielectric inhomogeneity on electrostatic twist rigidity of a helical biomolecule in Debye-Hückel regime</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020754?af=R</originId><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b46:7c9981b6</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020754?af=R</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>e0f7a86f</fingerprint><author><name>Amir Rezaie-Dereshgi</name></author><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020754?af=R</link><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1522950073000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Revisiting the origins of modern horses</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-g?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529849:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/44.7.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-g?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>bcbc52f6</fingerprint><author><name>Zahn, L.

Background &lt;p&gt;The ageing population and the expected increase in the number of elderly patients make an evidence-based assessment of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in old patients progressively more important. Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged &amp;lt;65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P&amp;lt;0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score. These risk factors can be utilized as potential predictors to identify the potential candidates for ECMO support.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Te-Chun Yeh, Hsiao-Huang Chang, Luo-Ping Ger, Ju-O Wang, Senyeong Kao, Shung-Tai Ho&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine clinical and ultrasonographic characteristics of male breast tumors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The medical records of male patients with breast lesions were retrieved from an electronic medical record database and a pathology database and retrospectively reviewed. A total of 112 men (125 breast masses) with preoperative breast ultrasonography (US) were included (median age, 59.50 years; age range, 15–96 years). Data extracted included patient age, if the lesions were bilateral, palpable, and tender, and the presence of nipple discharge. Breast lesion features on static US images were reviewed by three experienced radiologists without knowledge of physical examination or pathology results, original breast US image interpretations, or surgical outcomes. The US features were documented according to the BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) US lexicons. A forth radiologist compiled the data for analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 125 breast masses, palpable tender lumps and bilateral synchronous masses were more likely to be benign than malignant (both, 100% vs 0%, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Advanced age and bloody discharge from nipples were common in malignant lesions (P &amp;lt;0.05). A mass eccentric to a nipple, irregular shape, the presence of an echogenic halo, predominantly internal vascularity, and rich color flow signal on color Doppler ultrasound were significantly related to malignancy (all, P &amp;lt; 0.05). An echogenic halo and the presence of rich color flow signal were independent predictors of malignancy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Specific clinical and US characteristics of male breast tumors may help guide treatment, and determine if surgery or conservative treatment is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wei-Hsin Yuan, Anna Fen-Yau Li, Yi-Hong Chou, Hui-Chen Hsu, Ying-Yuan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.

We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%.

Pharmacological disruption of both of these interactions has long been sought after as an attractive strategy to fully restore p53-dependent tumor suppressor activity in cancers with wild-type p53. Selective targeting of this pathway has thus far been limited to MDM2-only small-molecule inhibitors, which lack affinity for MDMX. We demonstrate that dual MDMX/MDM2 inhibition with a stapled α-helical peptide (ALRN-6924), which has recently entered phase I clinical testing, produces marked antileukemic effects. ALRN-6924 robustly activates p53-dependent transcription at the single-cell and single-molecule levels and exhibits biochemical and molecular biological on-target activity in leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Dual MDMX/MDM2 inhibition by ALRN-6924 inhibits cellular proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cell lines and primary AML patient cells, including leukemic stem cell–enriched populations, and disrupts functional clonogenic and serial replating capacity. Furthermore, ALRN-6924 markedly improves survival in AML xenograft models.

The underlying causes have been the subject of much speculation, with particular attention paid to the shortcomings of the latest generation of vaccines. We formulated transmission models comprising competing hypotheses regarding vaccine failure and challenged them to explain 16 years of highly resolved incidence data from Massachusetts, United States. Our results suggest that the resurgence of pertussis is a predictable consequence of incomplete historical coverage with an imperfect vaccine that confers slowly waning immunity. We found evidence that the vaccine itself is effective at reducing overall transmission, yet that routine vaccination alone would be insufficient for elimination of the disease. Our results indicated that the core transmission group is schoolchildren. Therefore, efforts aimed at curtailing transmission in the population at large, and especially in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed if targeted at schoolchildren, rather than adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of pertussis over the past decades has resulted in incidence levels not witnessed in the United States since the 1950s. The underlying causes have been the subject of much speculation, with particular attention paid to the shortcomings of the latest generation of vaccines. We formulated transmission models comprising competing hypotheses regarding vaccine failure and challenged them to explain 16 years of highly resolved incidence data from Massachusetts, United States. Our results suggest that the resurgence of pertussis is a predictable consequence of incomplete historical coverage with an imperfect vaccine that confers slowly waning immunity.

Many fossil specimens exhibit deformations caused by taphonomic processes. Due to these deformations, even important specimens have to be excluded from morphometric analyses, impoverishing an already poor paleontological record. Techniques to retrodeform and virtually restore damaged (i.e. deformed) specimens are available, but these methods genenerally imply the use of a sparse set of bilateral landmarks, ignoring the fact that the distribution and amount of control points directly affects the result of the retrodeformation. We propose a method developed in the R environment and available in the R-package “Morpho” that, in addition to the landmark configurations, also allows using a set of semi-landmarks homogeneously distributed along curves and on surfaces. We evaluated the outcome of the retrodeformation, regarding the number of semi-landmarks used and its robustness against asymmetric noise, based on simulations using a virtually deformed gorilla cranium. Finally, we applied the method to a well-known Neanderthal cranium that exhibits signs of taphonomically induced asymmetry.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Schlager, Antonio Profico, Fabio Di Vincenzo, Giorgio Manzi&lt;/p&gt;

This process enables comparison across samples of two or more factor levels. A recurring issue with DGE analyses is the complicated nature of the comparisons to be made, in which a variety of factor combinations, pairwise comparisons, and main or blocked main effects need to be tested.

Cadmium exposure can cause renal tubular dysfunction. Recent studies show that vitamin D can play multiple roles in the body. However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium. A total of 133 subjects living in control area and two cadmium polluted areas were included in the present study. Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D ≥ 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1–0.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1–1.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D &amp;lt; 30 ng/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed in those subjects living in cadmium polluted areas or with high level of UCd or BCd. Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiao Chen, Yan Dai, Zhongqiu Wang, Guoying Zhu, Xiaoqiang Ding, Taiyi Jin&lt;/p&gt;
Cadmium exposure can cause renal tubular dysfunction. Recent studies show that vitamin D can play multiple roles in the body. However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium. A total of 133 subjects living in control area and two cadmium polluted areas were included in the present study. Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D ≥ 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1–0.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1–1.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D &amp;lt; 30 ng/ml, respectively.

Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium.</content></content></item><item><published>1522393200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>Porter 5: state-of-the-art ab initio prediction of protein secondary structure in 3 and 8 classes [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289033v2?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1627811e286:7c73fa4:9f3b30f2</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/289033</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289033v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>db9b421f</fingerprint><author><name>Torrisi, M.</name></author><crawled>1522432860806</crawled><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289033v2?rss=1</link><description>Motivation: Although Secondary Structure Predictors have been developed for more than 60 years, current ab initio methods have still some way to go to reach their theoretical limits.

Background &lt;p&gt;Low birth weight infant (LBWIs) are prone to mental and behavioural problems. As an important constituent of the brain and retina, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential for foetal infant mental and visual development. The effect of lactation supplemented with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) on the improvement of intelligence in low birth weight children requires further validation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this study, a comprehensive search of multiple databases was performed to identify studies focused the association between intelligence and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in LBWIs. Studies that compared the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) or the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence for Children (WISC) scores between LBWIs who were supplemented and controls that were not supplemented with LCPUFA during lactation were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The main outcome was the mean difference in the mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) of the BSID and the full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) and performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) of the WISC between LBWIs and controls. Our findings indicated that the mean BSID or WISC scores in LBWIs did not differ between the supplemented groups and controls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This meta-analysis does not reveal that LCPUFA supplementation has a significant impact on the level of intelligence in LBWIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Song, Ya Liu, Yun Pan, Xiaofeng Yuan, Pengyu Chang, Yuan Tian, Weiwei Cui, Dong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Linkage to and retention in care for US persons living with HIV (PLWH) after release from jail usually declines. We know of no rigorously evaluated behavioral interventions that can improve this. We hypothesized that a strengths-based case management intervention that we developed for PLWH leaving jail would increase linkage/retention in care (indicated by receipt of laboratory draws) and a suppressed HIV viral load (VL) in the year following release.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We conducted a quasi-experimental feasibility study of our intervention for PLWH jailed in Atlanta. We recruited 113 PLWH in jail starting in 2014. “SUCCESS” (Sustained, Unbroken Connection to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) began in jail and continued post-release. Subjects who started the intervention but subsequently began long-term incarcerations were excluded from further analysis. Persons who were retained in the intervention group were compared to contemporaneously incarcerated PLWH who did not receive the intervention. Identities were submitted to an enhanced HIV/AIDS reporting system (eHARS) at the state health department to capture all laboratories drawn. Both community engagement and care upon jail return were assessed equally. For 44 intervention participants released to Atlanta, 50% of care occurred on subsequent jail stays, as documented with EventFlow software. Forty-five receiving usual services only were recruited for comparison. By examining records of jail reentries, half of participants and 60% of controls recidivated (range: 1–8 returns). All but 6 participants in the intervention and 9 subjects in the comparison arm had ≥1 laboratory recorded in eHARS post-release. Among the intervention group, 52% were retained in care (i.e., had two laboratory studies, &gt; = 3 months apart), versus 40% among the comparison group (OR = 1.60, 95% CI (0.71, 3.81)). Both arms showed improved viral load suppression.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a trend towards increased retention for PLWH released from jail after SUCCESS, compared to usual services.

Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical features of postoperative delirium are similar to the core features of alpha synuclein-related cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which precede the cardinal motor features of PD, are likely to be risk factors for developing postoperative delirium. We investigated the association between PD-related NMSs and postoperative delirium in old people undergoing elective spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective study. Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis.

Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical features of postoperative delirium are similar to the core features of alpha synuclein-related cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which precede the cardinal motor features of PD, are likely to be risk factors for developing postoperative delirium. We investigated the association between PD-related NMSs and postoperative delirium in old people undergoing elective spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective study. Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis. We assessed eight easily-assessed and representative PD-related NMSs 1 day before the scheduled surgery using tests or questionnaires for each symptom. The presence of delirium was determined by using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Fifteen (14.4%) of the 104 participants (age, 71.7 ± 4.7 years; men, 34.6%) met the CAM criteria for post-operative delirium.

Despite evidence that the ability to taste is weakened by obesity and can be rescued with weight loss intervention, few studies have investigated the molecular effects of obesity on the taste system. Taste bud cells undergo continual turnover even in adulthood, exhibiting an average life span of only a few weeks, tightly controlled by a balance of proliferation and cell death. Recent data reveal that an acute inflammation event can alter this balance. We demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OTfX7eySHIY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Kaufman, Ezen Choo, Anna Koh, Robin Dando&lt;/p&gt;

Identity-based proxy re-signature (IDPRS) is a novel cryptographic primitive that allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a signature under one identity into another signature under another identity on the same message by using a re-signature key. Due to this transformation function, IDPRS is very useful in constructing privacy-preserving schemes for various information systems. Key revocation functionality is important in practical IDPRS for managing users dynamically; however, the existing IDPRS schemes do not provide revocation mechanisms that allow the removal of misbehaving or compromised users from the system. In this paper, we first introduce a notion called revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (RIDPRS) to achieve the revocation functionality. We provide a formal definition of RIDPRS as well as its security model. Then, we present a concrete RIDPRS scheme that can resist signing key exposure and prove that the proposed scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen identity and message attacks in the standard model. To further improve the performance of signature verification in RIDPRS, we introduce a notion called server-aided revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (SA-RIDPRS). Moreover, we extend the proposed RIDPRS scheme to the SA-RIDPRS scheme and prove that this extended scheme is secure against adaptive chosen message and collusion attacks. The analysis results show that our two schemes remain efficient in terms of computational complexity when implementing user revocation procedures. In particular, in the SA-RIDPRS scheme, the verifier needs to perform only a bilinear pairing and four exponentiation operations to verify the validity of the signature. Compared with other IDPRS schemes in the standard model, our SA-RIDPRS scheme greatly reduces the computation overhead of verification.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaodong Yang, Chunlin Chen, Tingchun Ma, Jinli Wang, Caifen Wang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARα)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Egl nine homolog 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;EGLN3)&lt;/i&gt; play critical roles in facilitating the adaptation to a hypoxic environment. However, the relationship between &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; variants and hypoxic adaptation remains poorly understood in Tibetan chickens. To better understand the effects of genetic variation, we sequenced exons of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; in 138 Lowland chickens (LC) from 7 breeds that were located in Emei, Miyi, Shimian, Wanyuan, Pengxian, and Muchuan in the Sichuan province, and Wenchang in the Hainan province (altitudes for these locations are below 1800 meters). Total 166 Tibetan chickens (TC) from 7 subpopulations that were located in Shigatse, Lhoka, Lhasa, Garze, Aba, Diqing and Yushu in the Tibetan area were also sequenced (altitudes greater than 2700 meters). One single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs316017491, C &gt; T) was identified in &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and was shared by TC and LC with no significant difference for allele frequencies between them (P &gt; 0.05). Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP1, A29410G; SNP2, rs13886097; SNP3, T29467C; SNP4, rs735915170; SNP5, rs736599044; and SNP6, rs740077421) including one non-synonymous mutation (SNP2, T &gt; C) were identified in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. This is the first report of SNP1 and SNP3. There was a difference between TC and LC for allele frequencies (P &amp;lt;0.01), except for SNP1, SNP4, and SNP5) The fix index statistic test indicated that there was population differentiation between TC and LC for SNP2, SNP3, and SNP6 in &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic distance among chickens, finch and great tit were close for both &lt;i&gt;EGLN3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt;. Bioinformatics analysis of &lt;i&gt;PPARα&lt;/i&gt; showed that SNP2 leads to an amino acid substitution of Ile for Met, which results in the protein being more likely to be hydrolyzed.

Background &lt;p&gt;Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used as disease modifying treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Rheumatological and dermatological guidelines to prevent MTX-induced adverse events diverge in the number and frequency of blood tests. These differences are not based on evidence indicating a higher risk for patients with psoriasis compared to PsA or rheumatic arthritis (RA). This raises the question if multiple testing increases safety, or results in false positive signals potentially leading to early withdrawal of an effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;Compare the effects of MTX monitoring strategies by rheumatologists and dermatologists regarding drug survival, reasons for withdrawal and safety.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective follow-up of all patients diagnosed with psoriasis by dermatologists or PsA by rheumatologists. Included were consecutive patients who started methotrexate (MTX) between 2006 and 2012 and had a scheduled follow-up by dermatologist or rheumatologist. Exclusions were: drug not started after the first prescription or incomplete availability of lab data. Data were extracted from electronic records: start and stop dates and dosing of MTX; treatment with folic acid and dose; reasons for withdrawal of MTX; numbers of blood sampling and types of laboratory tests performed for MTX safety; number of abnormal tests; occurrence of any serious adverse event (SAE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;190 Psoriasis and 196 PsA patients starting methotrexate (MTX) were included. Age and sex were comparable. PsA patients used higher initial and maximum doses of MTX and folic acid, but psoriasis patients had a higher frequency of abnormal laboratory results (0.14 vs 0.03 per treatment month, p&amp;lt;0.001), resulting in a striking difference in withdrawal of MTX for abnormal liver enzymes (15.8% vs 3.6%, p&amp;lt;0.001). In PsA patients MTX was withdrawn less frequently for ineffectiveness (15.8 vs 24.2%, p&amp;lt;0.05) leading to longer drug survival in the first course of treatment (37.4±30 vs 18.8±19.1 months). Repeated courses of MTX were more often prescribed by rheumatologists than by dermatologists. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of SAE (psoriasis 0.0041 vs PsA 0.0038 per treatment month) or death (1.6% vs 2.0%) between these groups. Hospital admissions related to infection were recorded in 6 (3.1%) PsA vs 4 (2.1%) psoriasis patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Strict monitoring by dermatologists resulted in more abnormal findings, which reduced drug survival of MTX. The limited monitoring strategy by rheumatologists was not associated with more SAEs. Further research in other populations is needed to confirm whether reduced intensity of monitoring can optimize the use of MTX with sufficient long-term safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Felien T.

Thyroid hormone (TH) orchestrates amphibian metamorphosis. Thus, this developmental phase is often used to study TH-dependent responses in specific tissues. However, TH signaling appears early in development raising the question of the control of TH availability in specific cell types prior to metamorphosis. TH availability is under strict temporal and tissue-specific control by deiodinases. We examined the expression of the TH-inactivating enzyme, deiodinase type 3 (D3), during early retinal development. To this end we created a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; transgenic line expressing GFP from the Xenopus &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter region (p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;) and followed p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;–GFP expression in pre-metamorphic tadpoles. To validate retinal GFP expression in the transgenic line as a function of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity, we used &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to compare endogenous &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression to reporter-driven GFP activity. Retinal expression of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; increased during pre-metamorphosis through stages NF41, 45 and 48. Both sets of results show &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; to have cell-specific, dynamic expression in the pre-metamorphic retina. At stage NF48, &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression co-localised with markers for photoreceptors, rods, Opsin-S cones and bipolar neurons. In contrast, in post-metamorphic juveniles &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression was reduced and spatially confined to certain photoreceptors and amacrine cells. We compared &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression at stages NF41 and NF48 with TH-dependent transcriptional responses using another transgenic reporter line: &lt;i&gt;THbZIP&lt;/i&gt;-GFP and by analyzing the expression of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-regulated genes in distinct TH availability contexts. At stage NF48, the majority of retinal cells expressing &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; were negative for T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; signaling. Notably, most ganglion cells were virtually both &lt;i&gt;dio3-&lt;/i&gt;free and T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-responsive. The results show that &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; can reduce TH availability at the cellular scale. Further, a reduction in &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression can trigger fine-tuned T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; action in cell-type specific maturation at the right time, as exemplified here in photoreceptor survival in the pre-metamorphic retina.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Karine Le Blay, Laëtitia Préau, Ghislaine Morvan-Dubois, Barbara Demeneix&lt;/p&gt;
Thyroid hormone (TH) orchestrates amphibian metamorphosis. Thus, this developmental phase is often used to study TH-dependent responses in specific tissues. However, TH signaling appears early in development raising the question of the control of TH availability in specific cell types prior to metamorphosis. TH availability is under strict temporal and tissue-specific control by deiodinases. We examined the expression of the TH-inactivating enzyme, deiodinase type 3 (D3), during early retinal development. To this end we created a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; transgenic line expressing GFP from the Xenopus &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter region (p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;) and followed p&lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt;–GFP expression in pre-metamorphic tadpoles. To validate retinal GFP expression in the transgenic line as a function of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity, we used &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to compare endogenous &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression to reporter-driven GFP activity. Retinal expression of &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; increased during pre-metamorphosis through stages NF41, 45 and 48. Both sets of results show &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; to have cell-specific, dynamic expression in the pre-metamorphic retina.

In contrast, in post-metamorphic juveniles &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression was reduced and spatially confined to certain photoreceptors and amacrine cells. We compared &lt;i&gt;dio3&lt;/i&gt; expression at stages NF41 and NF48 with TH-dependent transcriptional responses using another transgenic reporter line: &lt;i&gt;THbZIP&lt;/i&gt;-GFP and by analyzing the expression of T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-regulated genes in distinct TH availability contexts.

To unveil novel global changes associated with corpus luteum (CL) maturation, we analyzed transcriptome data for the bovine CL on days 4 and 11, representing the developing vs. mature gland. Our analyses revealed 681 differentially expressed genes (363 and 318 on day 4 and 11, respectively), with ≥2 fold change and FDR of &amp;lt;5%. Different gene ontology (GO) categories were represented prominently in transcriptome data at these stages (e.g. days 4: cell cycle, chromosome, DNA metabolic process and replication and on day 11: immune response; lipid metabolic process and complement activation). Based on bioinformatic analyses, select genes expression in day 4 and 11 CL was validated with quantitative real-time PCR. Cell specific expression was also determined in enriched luteal endothelial and steroidogenic cells. Genes related to the angiogenic process such as &lt;i&gt;NOS3&lt;/i&gt;, which maintains dilated vessels and &lt;i&gt;MMP9&lt;/i&gt;, matrix degrading enzyme, were higher on day 4. Importantly, our data suggests day 11 CL acquire mechanisms to prevent blood vessel sprouting and promote their maturation by expressing &lt;i&gt;NOTCH4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JAG1&lt;/i&gt;, greatly enriched in luteal endothelial cells. Another endothelial specific gene, &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt;, was identified here in the CL for the first time. &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt; is an adhesion molecule enabling lymphocyte migration, its higher levels at mid cycle are expected to support the transmigration of immune cells into the CL at this stage. Together with steroidogenic genes, most of the genes regulating de-novo cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (e.g &lt;i&gt;HMGCS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HMGCR&lt;/i&gt;) and cholesterol uptake from plasma (&lt;i&gt;LDLR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) were upregulated in the mature CL. These findings provide new insight of the processes involved in CL maturation including blood vessel growth and stabilization, leucocyte transmigration as well as progesterone synthesis as the CL matures.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sigal Kfir, Raghavendra Basavaraja, Noa Wigoda, Shifra Ben-Dor, Irit Orr, Rina Meidan&lt;/p&gt;

The bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia was formally described two decades ago and originally believed to be a minor member of many ecosystems; however, it is now recognized as ubiquitous and abundant in both soil and aquatic systems. Nevertheless, knowledge of the drivers of its relative abundance and within-phylum habitat preferences remains sparse, especially in lake systems. Here, we documented the distribution of Verrucomicrobia in 12 inland lakes in Southeastern Michigan, a Laurentian Great Lake (Lake Michigan), and a freshwater estuary, which span a gradient in lake sizes, depths, residence times, and trophic states. A wide range of physical and geochemical parameters was covered by sampling seasonally from the surface and bottom of each lake, and by separating samples into particle-associated and free-living fractions. On average, Verrucomicrobia was the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most abundant phylum (range 1.7–41.7%). Fraction, season, station, and depth explained up to 70% of the variance in Verrucomicrobia community composition and preference for these habitats was phylogenetically conserved at the class-level. When relative abundance was linearly modeled against environmental data, Verrucomicrobia and non-Verrucomicrobia bacterial community composition correlated to similar quantitative environmental parameters, although there were lake system-dependent differences and &gt; 55% of the variance remained unexplained. A majority of the phylum exhibited preference for the particle-associated fraction and two classes (Opitutae and Verrucomicrobiae) were identified to be more abundant during the spring season. This study highlights the high relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in north temperate lake systems and expands insights into drivers of within-phylum habitat preferences of the Verrucomicrobia.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Edna Chiang, Marian L.

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Together, these data suggest that TLR3 promotes the clearance of &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; during early and mid-stages of genital tract infection, and that loss of TLR3 is detrimental in the development hydrosalpinx.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sebastian E.

The red flour beetle, &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt;, is an important model insect and agricultural pest. However, many standard genetic tools are lacking or underdeveloped in this system. Here, we present a set of new reagents to augment existing &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; genetic tools. We demonstrate a new GAL4 driver line that employs the promoter of a ribosomal protein gene to drive expression of a UAS responder in the fat body. We also present a novel dual fluorescent reporter that labels cell membranes and nuclei with different fluorophores for the analysis of cellular morphology. This approach also demonstrates the functionality of the viral T2A peptide for bicistronic gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt;. To facilitate classical genetic analysis, we created lines with visible genetic markers by CRISPR-mediated disruption of the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ebony&lt;/i&gt; body color loci with a cassette carrying an attP site, enabling future φC31-mediated integration. Together, the reagents presented here will facilitate more robust genetic analysis in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; and serve as a blueprint for the further development of this powerful model’s genetic toolkit.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Johnathan C.

Finally, several examples of cancer high-throughput data analysis and visualization in the context of comprehensive signalling maps are presented.</content></content></item><item><published>1521961200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>Deciphering signaling specificity with interpretable deep neural networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>2</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288647v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1625fd4ef0d:5591233:7d6c1c1c</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/25/288647</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288647v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>4a74c41a</fingerprint><author><name>Luo, Y.</name></author><crawled>1522026213133</crawled><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288647v1?rss=1</link><description>Protein kinase phosphorylation is a prevalent post-translational modification (PTM) regulating protein function and transmitting signals throughout the cell.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is the transformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promote tumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motile tumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeleton regulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling of unbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2 (mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underlies tumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whether CAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media (CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly and robustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammary fibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAF cell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine array analysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative to control WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2 protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kaitlyn M.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Variations in the degree of hirsutism among women of different ethnic backgrounds may stem from multiple etiologies. Shorter length of the polymorphic CAG repeats of the &lt;i&gt;androgen receptor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt;) gene may be associated with increased activity of the receptor leading to hirsutism. We hypothesized that there are ethnic differences in the degree of hirsutism that is unrelated to androgen levels among Israeli women, and that the CAG repeats length may contribute to these differences. Anti-androgenic therapies, such as spironolactone, could be suggested if a shorter CAG repeats length is found to affect the difference in the degree of hirsutism between the ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Healthy Israeli Jewish women aged 18–45 years of Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi origin were invited to participate. Hirsutism was assessed using the simplified Ferriman–Gallwey (sFG) score, and serum total testosterone levels were measured as well. The CAG repeats length was determined by PCR. Methylation-sensitive methods were used to detect the fractional activity of each allele, and the weighted mean was calculated for the CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and eight women were recruited (49 Ashkenazi and 59 non-Ashkenazi). The Ashkenazi women had a significantly lower degree of hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), lower mean BMI (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), total testosterone levels (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017), and longer weighted bi-allelic CAG repeats mean (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015) compared to non-Ashkenazi women. For the group as a whole, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of CAG repeats in the &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; gene and the sFG score, while the number of repeats was not related to testosterone levels. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that ethnic origin and the CAG repeats length were the strongest factors affecting hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a significant difference in the degree of hirsutism between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi women in Israel that is partially explained by CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naomi Weintrob, Ori Eyal, Meital Slakman, Anat Segev Becker, Galit Israeli, Ofra Kalter-Leibovici, Shay Ben-Shachar&lt;/p&gt;

Interactions between DNA and proteins located in the cell nucleus play an important role in controlling physiological processes by specifying, augmenting and regulating context-specific transcription events. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a widely used methodology to study DNA-protein interactions and has been successfully used in various cell types for over three decades. More recently, by combining ChIP with genomic screening technologies and Next Generation Sequencing (e.g. ChIP-seq), it has become possible to profile DNA-protein interactions (including covalent histone modifications) across entire genomes. However, the applicability of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq has rarely been extended to non-model species because of a number of technical challenges. Here we report a method that can be used to identify genome wide covalent histone modifications in a group of non-model fruit fly species (Diptera: Tephritidae). The method was developed by testing and refining protocols that have been used in model organisms, including &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that this method is suitable for a group of economically important pest fruit fly species, viz., &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera dorsalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zeugodacus cucurbitae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera tryoni&lt;/i&gt;. We also report an example ChIP-seq dataset for &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tryoni&lt;/i&gt;, providing evidence for histone modifications in the genome of a tephritid fruit fly for the first time. Since tephritids are major agricultural pests globally, this methodology will be a valuable resource to study taxa-specific evolutionary questions and to assist with pest management. It also provides a basis for researchers working with other non-model species to undertake genome wide DNA-protein interaction studies.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kumaran Nagalingam, Michał T.

The IL-1 cytokine family includes eleven members, among which Il-36α, β and γ, IL-36Ra and IL-38. The IL-36 cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-38 is also expressed in the skin and was previously proposed to act as an IL-36 antagonist. In this study, we thus examined expression and function of Il-38 in a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin inflammation. &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA was detected in the epidermis and in primary mouse keratinocytes, but not in dermal fibroblasts. At the peak of IMQ-induced inflammation, skin &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels were reduced, whereas &lt;i&gt;Il-36ra&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression increased. The severity of IMQ-induced skin inflammation, as assessed by recording ear thickness and histological changes, was similar in Il-38 KO and WT littermate control mice, while, in contrast, Il-36ra-deficient mice displayed more severe skin pathology than their WT littermates. Il-38-deficiency had no impact on IMQ-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators in the skin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, on the basal expression of various cytokines or chemokines by cultured primary keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, or on the response of these cells to Il-36β. Finally, after cessation of topical IMQ application, the resolution of skin inflammation was also not altered in Il-38 KO mice. In conclusion, Il-38-deficiency did not impact the development or resolution of IMQ-induced skin inflammation. Our observations further suggest that endogenous Il-38 does not exert Il-36 inhibitory activity in this model, or in cultured skin cells. A potential anti-inflammatory function of Il-38 in mouse skin thus still remains to be demonstrated.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Palomo, Sabina Troccaz, Dominique Talabot-Ayer, Emiliana Rodriguez, Gaby Palmer&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We examine to what extent the effect of early-life conditions (health and socioeconomic status) on health in later life is mediated by educational attainment and life-course trajectories (fertility, partnership, employment).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 12,034), we apply, separately by gender, multichannel sequence analysis and cluster analysis to obtain groups of similar family and employment histories. The KHB method is used to disentangle direct and indirect effects of early-life conditions on health.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Early-life-conditions indirectly impact on health in later life as result of their influence on education and family and employment trajectories. For example, between 22% and 42% of the effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Even higher percentages are found for men (35% - 57%). On the contrary, the positive effect of poor health at childhood on poor health at older ages is not significantly mediated by education and life-course trajectories. Education captures most of the mediating effect of parental socio-economic status. More specifically, between 66% and 75% of the indirect effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Again, higher percentages are found for men (86% - 93%). Early-life conditions, especially socioeconomic status, influence family and employment trajectories indirectly through their impact on education. We also find a persistent direct impact of early-life conditions on health at older ages.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that early-life experiences influence education and life-course trajectories and health in later life, suggesting that public investments in children are expected to produce long lasting effects on people’s lives throughout the different phases of their life-course.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Arpino, Jordi Gumà, Albert Julià&lt;/p&gt;

A dominant mechanism in the Judgment and Decision Making literature states that information is accumulated about each choice option until a decision threshold is met. Only after that threshold does a subject start to execute a motor response to indicate their choice. However, recent research has revealed spatial gradients in motor responses as a function of comparison difficulty as well as changes-of-mind in the middle of an action, both suggesting continued accumulation and processing of decision-related signals after the decision boundary. Here we present a formal model and supporting data from a number comparison task that a continuous motor planner, combined with a simple statistical inference scheme, can model detailed behavioral effects without assuming a threshold. This threshold-free model reproduces subjects’ sensitivity to numerical distance in reaching, accuracy, reaction time, and changes of mind. We argue that the motor system positions the effectors using an optimal biomechanical feedback controller, and continuous statistical inference on outputs from cognitive processes.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Santiago Alonso-Diaz, Jessica F.

However, compared to bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell expression profiles are extremely noisy, as they only capture a fraction of the transcripts present in the cell. Here, we propose the k-nearest neighbor smoothing (kNN-smoothing) algorithm, designed to reduce noise by aggregating information from similar cells (neighbors) in a computationally efficient and statistically tractable manner. The algorithm is based on the observation that across protocols, the technical noise exhibited by UMI-filtered scRNA-Seq data closely follows Poisson statistics. Smoothing is performed by first identifying the nearest neighbors of each cell in a step-wise fashion, based on partially smoothed and variance-stabilized expression profiles, and then aggregating their transcript counts. We show that kNN-smoothing greatly improves the detection of clusters of cells and co-expressed genes, and clearly outperforms other smoothing methods on simulated data. To accurately perform smoothing for datasets containing highly similar cell populations, we propose the kNN-smoothing 2 algorithm, in which neighbors are determined after projecting the partially smoothed data onto the first few principal components. We show that unlike its predecessor, kNN-smoothing 2 can accurately distinguish between cells from different T cell subsets, and enables their identification in peripheral blood using unsupervised methods. Our work facilitates the analysis of scRNA-Seq data across a broad range of applications, including the identification of cell populations in heterogeneous tissues and the characterization of dynamic processes such as cellular differentiation.

There is still no consensus on the true origin of fatal yellowing, one of the most important diseases affecting oil palm (&lt;i&gt;Elaeis guineensis&lt;/i&gt; Jacq.) plantations. This study involved two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MS&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;) analyses to identify changes in protein profiles of oil palms affected by FY disease. Oil palm roots were sampled from two growing areas. Differential accumulation of proteins was assessed by comparing plants with and without symptoms and between plants at different stages of FY development. Most of the proteins identified with differential accumulation were those related to stress response and energy metabolism. The latter proteins include the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, related to alcohol fermentation, which were identified in plants with and without symptoms. The presence of these enzymes suggests an anaerobic condition before or during FY. Transketolase, isoflavone reductase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and ferritin, among others, were identified as potential marker proteins and could be used to guide selection of FY-tolerant oil palm genotypes or to understand the source of this anomaly. When comparing different stages of FY, we observed high accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase and other abiotic stress related-proteins at all disease stages. On the other hand, biological stress-related proteins were more accumulated at later stages of the disease. These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sidney Vasconcelos do Nascimento, Marcelo Murad Magalhães, Roberto Lisboa Cunha, Paulo Henrique de Oliveira Costa, Ronnie Cley de Oliveira Alves, Guilherme Corrêa de Oliveira, Rafael Borges da Silva Valadares&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Epipremnum aureum&lt;/i&gt; is an important foliage plant in the Araceae family. In this study, we have sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureum&lt;/i&gt; by using Illumina Hiseq sequencing platforms. This genome is a double-stranded circular DNA sequence of 164,831 bp that contains 35.8% GC. The two inverted repeats (IRa and IRb; 26,606 bp) are spaced by a small single-copy region (22,868 bp) and a large single-copy region (88,751 bp). The chloroplast genome has 131 (113 unique) functional genes, including 86 (79 unique) protein-coding genes, 37 (30 unique) tRNA genes, and eight (four unique) rRNA genes. Tandem repeats comprise the majority of the 43 long repetitive sequences. In addition, 111 simple sequence repeats are present, with mononucleotides being the most common type and di- and tetranucleotides being infrequent events. Positive selection pressure on &lt;i&gt;rps12&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureum&lt;/i&gt; chloroplast has been demonstrated via synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates and selection pressure sites analyses. &lt;i&gt;Ycf15&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;infA&lt;/i&gt; are pseudogenes in this species. We constructed a Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the complete chloroplast genomes of 38 species from 13 families. Those results strongly indicated that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureum&lt;/i&gt; is positioned as the sister of &lt;i&gt;Colocasia esculenta&lt;/i&gt; within the Araceae family. This work may provide information for further study of the molecular phylogenetic relationships within Araceae, as well as molecular markers and breeding novel varieties by chloroplast genetic-transformation of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureum&lt;/i&gt; in particular.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Na Tian, Limin Han, Chen Chen, Zhezhi Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Lhermie, Loren William Tauer, Yrjo Tapio Gröhn&lt;/p&gt;

Mimicry can occur in several contexts, including sexual interactions. In some cases, males mimic females to gain access to potential mates. In contrast, there are relatively few examples of species where females mimic males, and we know very little about what drives these patterns. Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain female mimicry of males. The first is that mimicry is used to reduce harassment of females by males. The second is that mimicry is used to display dominance over other females. In this study, we tested these hypotheses in &lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&lt;/i&gt; fishes, wherein females of several species have pigmentation on their anal fin of the same coloration and shape, and in the same location, as the genitalia of males. To test if female mimicry of males reduces male harassment, we experimentally manipulated female pigmentation and observed male preference for females with and without male-like pigmentation. To test the effect that female mimicry of males has on female dominance, we observed how females respond to anal fin pigmentation patterns of companion females. We found that neither of these hypotheses was supported by our data. We conclude that similarities in anal fin pigmentation between male and female &lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&lt;/i&gt; fishes is not an adaptation to reduce male harassment or to signal dominance between females. Alternative explanations must exist, including the possibility that these similarities are simply non-adaptive.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kandace M.

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making.

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/47MpyGKP0b0/article</href></item></alternate></item><item><published>1521529200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03577-2/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3577_Fig3_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>220</height><width>685</width></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Suppression of low-frequency charge noise in superconducting resonators by surface spin desorption</title><engagement>48</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03577-2</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16242f09326:2ddffb7:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03577-2</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/rqGFYeAftNc/s41467-018-03577-2</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>e2b7769f</fingerprint><author><name>S.

Past and contemporary human actions are causing numerous changes in patterns and processes at various ecosystem scales and trophic levels, including unintended downstream changes, such as species interactions. In its native range &lt;i&gt;Acca sellowiana&lt;/i&gt; (Feijoa) combines some characteristics of human interactions: incipient domestication, restricted to subtropical Atlantic Forest highlands, associated with the threatened conifer &lt;i&gt;Araucaria angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Araucaria), within a domesticated landscape with anthropogenic forest patches, and provides fruit at a time of resource shortage (Araucaria seeds—&lt;i&gt;pinhão&lt;/i&gt;). We quantify the trophic relationships between Feijoa and vertebrates, and evaluate the influences on interactions caused by environmental variations, Feijoa domestication evidences, spatial distance and fruit availability. In four sites within protected areas, we selected 28 focal individuals of Feijoa (seven/site) and collected three temporal replicas between 2015 and 2016, when we measured productivity and frugivory via 45-second videos taken with camera traps. Using ecological network, rarefaction curves and variation partitioning analyses, we evaluate the frugivory network topology, the spatiotemporal structure of communities in relation to fruit availability and the influence of predictive variables on frugivory. We found a large spatiotemporal variation in productivity of Feijoa and that 20 species consumed Feijoa fruits, with a species degree of 2.8 (±5.7) and average Feijoa degree of 14.4 (±10.1), in a modular network with intermediary connectance. Rarefaction curves showed that richness and the independent records are congruent with the fruit amount. Variation partitioning showed that, for the focal individuals, canopy area, green coverage, patch size and distance to water influenced frugivory, and the Feijoa domestication influenced significantly the mammalian frugivory. Feijoa is an important resource that provides food during the time of year when &lt;i&gt;Pinhão&lt;/i&gt; is absent, and attracts frugivores, maintain the residual diversity of vertebrates contributing to the structure of communities in highlands. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the interactions between vertebrates and an incipient domesticated tree, in a cultural landscape and highly threatened environment, under a basal foodweb approach with implications for bottom-up and top-down forces. The results contribute to understanding animal-plant relationships, including concepts that can be replicated for other sessile prey and mobile predators in any region or habitat under different gradients of management. Thus, this work shows how human actions can change not only patterns of distribution and abundance but also the diversity and direction of interspecific interactions among species.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juliano André Bogoni, Maurício Eduardo Graipel, Nivaldo Peroni&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides. While these effects have been demonstrated for some substances (e.g. cocaine), current available data for others are more controversial (e.g. cannabis) or very limited (e.g. ecstasy).&lt;/p&gt; Aims of the study &lt;p&gt;To collect data on the type and frequency of psychoactive substance use in cases of emergency department (ED) presentations related to interpersonal violence.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, between May 2012 and June 2016. The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence. Because of the high prevalence of alcohol co-use, no final conclusions can be drawn on the contribution of single substances.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Evangelia Liakoni, Fabienne Gartwyl, Meret Ricklin, Aristomenis K.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). Natural killer cell responses play a crucial role in autoimmune disease through innate immunity, in which killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are closely involved. Although the genetic combination of KIRs with their specific HLA class I ligands has been associated with IBD in Caucasians, such KIR-HLA receptor-ligand combinations are not fully understood in the Japanese. We investigated 14 KIR genes along with HLA-Bw and -C ligands in 90 patients with UC and 50 patients with CD and compared them with the characteristics of 325 healthy control subjects. The frequency of HLA-Bw4 was significantly increased in patients with UC (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;; odds ratio [OR] = 3.39) and CD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0065; OR = 2.32) versus controls. The UC group had a significantly higher frequency of KIR2DS3 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024; OR = 1.94) and lower frequency of KIR2DS4 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019; OR = 0.40) and KIR2DL1-HLA-C2 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.035; OR = 0.47). The Tel-A/B haplotype was significantly decreased in UC patients (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0056; OR = 0.49). The frequency of KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 was significantly higher in patients with UC (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 4.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;; OR = 3.12) and CD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0067; OR = 2.30).

In conclusion, HLA-Bw4 and KIR-HLA pairs may play an important role in the genetic susceptibility to IBD in the Japanese.</content></content></item><item><published>1522220400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03520-5/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3520_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height><width>674</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Dedicated photoreceptor pathways in Drosophila larvae mediate navigation by processing either spatial or temporal cues</title><engagement>4</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03520-5</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1626bec6ec5:6955dda:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03520-5</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/nNfOBEuWLGU/s41467-018-03520-5</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ac3a83c8</fingerprint><author><name>Tim-Henning Humberg</name></author><crawled>1522229079749</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03520-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dedicated photoreceptor pathways in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae mediate navigation by processing either spatial or temporal cues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated photoreceptor pathways in &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt; larvae mediate navigation by processing either spatial or temporal cues, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03520-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03520-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The response of Drosophila larva to light depends on both spatial and temporal inputs.

Currently, most of existing methods test the association between multiple traits and a single common variant. However, the variant-by-variant methods for common variant association studies may not be optimal for rare variant association studies due to the allelic heterogeneity as well as the extreme rarity of individual variants. In this article, we developed a statistical method by testing an optimally weighted combination of variants with multiple traits (TOWmuT) to test the association between multiple traits and a weighted combination of variants (rare and/or common) in a genomic region. TOWmuT is robust to the directions of effects of causal variants and is applicable to different types of traits. Using extensive simulation studies, we compared the performance of TOWmuT with the following five existing methods: gene association with multiple traits (GAMuT), multiple sequence kernel association test (MSKAT), adaptive weighting reverse regression (AWRR), single-TOW, and MANOVA. Our results showed that, in all of the simulation scenarios, TOWmuT has correct type I error rates and is consistently more powerful than the other five tests. We also illustrated the usefulness of TOWmuT by analyzing a whole-genome genotyping data from a lung function study.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Joint analysis of multiple traits has recently become popular since it can increase statistical power to detect genetic variants and there is increasing evidence showing that pleiotropy is a widespread phenomenon in complex diseases.

An epidemiological model is presented that provides a comprehensive description of the transmission pathways involved for recurrent tuberculosis (TB), whereby cured individuals can become reinfected. Our main goal is to determine conditions that lead to the appearance of a backward bifurcation. This occurs when an asymptotically stable infection free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable non-trivial equilibria even though the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is less than unity. Although, some 10-30% cases of TB are recurrent, the role of recurrent TB as far as the formation of backward bifurcation is concerned, is rarely if ever studied. The model used here incorporates progressive primary infection, exogenous reinfection, endogenous reactivation and recurrent TB as transmission mechanisms that contribute to TB progression. Unlike other studies of TB dynamics that make use of frequency dependent transmission rates, our analysis provides exact backward bifurcation threshold conditions without resorting to commonly applied approximations and simplifying assumptions. Exploration of the model through analytical and numerical analysis reveal that recurrent TB is sometimes capable of triggering hysteresis effects which allow TB to persist when &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 1 even though there is no backward bifurcation. Furthermore, recurrent TB can independently induce backward bifurcation phenomena if it exceeds a certain threshold.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Isaac Mwangi Wangari, Lewi Stone&lt;/p&gt;

Novel rutin-loaded zein-sodium caseinate nanoparticles (ZP) with antioxidant activity in aqueous medium were investigated. The results showed that the sodium caseinate concentrations, dosages of rutin and ethanol volume fractions significantly affected the zein nanoparticles’ characteristics. Concerning the antioxidant properties, the highest values of rutin loaded ZP obtained using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging and 2 and 2&apos;-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) decolourisation assays were 52.7% and 71.2%, respectively, and the total antioxidant capacity was 0.40 nmol g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke patients with active cancer frequently experience early neurological deterioration (END); however, the predictors of END are not well studied. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has recently been described as a predictor of poor outcomes in cancer and stroke. However, its role in cancer-related stroke has not been addressed.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;We aimed to evaluate the association between the NLR and END in cancer-related stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We included 85 cryptogenic stroke patients with active cancer. END was defined as an increase ≥ 4 on the total National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score within 72 hours of admission. The NLR was calculated as the ratio of the absolute neutrophil count to the absolute lymphocyte count. We obtained the NLR during the following three periods: at admission, 1–3 days after admission (D 1–3 NLR) and 4–7 days after admission (D 4–7 NLR).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;END occurred in 15 (18%) of the 85 patients. END was significantly associated with the initial NIHSS score, infarction volume, and the D 1–3 NLR. In multivariate analysis, a higher D 1–3 NLR, measured before END events, remained an independent predictor of END [adjusted odds ratio = 2.78, 95% confidence interval = 1.09–7.08, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.032]. In terms of temporal changes in the NLR, the END group showed a tendency toward temporal increase in the NLR at D 1–3 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.061) with subsequent decrements in the D 4–7 NLR (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.088), while the non-END group showed no significant changes in the NLR between periods.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated that a higher NLR could predict END events in cryptogenic stroke patients with active cancer. However, the results should be confirmed in further large prospective studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ki-Woong Nam, Tae Jung Kim, Chi Kyung Kim, Heejung Mo, Han-Yeong Jeong, Min Kyoung Kang, Moon-Ku Han, Sang-Bae Ko, Byung-Woo Yoon&lt;/p&gt;

The importance of patch quality for amphibians is frequently overlooked in distribution models. Here we demonstrate that it is highly important for the persistence of endemic and endangered amphibians found in the threatened and fragile ecosystems that are the rocky plateaus in Western Maharashtra, India. These plateaus are ferricretes of laterite and characterise the northern section of the Western Ghats/Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, the eighth most important global hotspot and one of the three most threatened by population growth. We present statistically supported habitat associations for endangered and data-deficient Indian amphibians, demonstrating significant relationships between individual species and their microhabitats. Data were collected during early monsoon across two seasons. Twenty-one amphibian taxa were identified from 14 lateritic plateaus between 67 and 1179m above sea level. Twelve of the study taxa had significant associations with microhabitats using a stepwise analysis of the AICc subroutine (distLM, Primer-e, v7). Generalist taxa were associated with increased numbers of microhabitat types. Non-significant associations are reported for the remaining 9 taxa. Microhabitat distribution was spatially structured and driven by climate and human activity. Woody plants were associated with 44% of high-elevation taxa. Of the 8 low-elevation taxa 63% related to water bodies and 60% of those were associated with pools. Rock size and abundance were important for 33% of high elevation specialists. Three of the 4 caecilians were associated with rocks in addition to soil and stream presence. We conclude the plateaus are individualistic patches whose habitat quality is defined by their microhabitats within climatic zones.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher J.

We conclude the plateaus are individualistic patches whose habitat quality is defined by their microhabitats within climatic zones.</content></content></item><item><published>1521270000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><unread>False</unread><title>Protein phase separation provides long-term memory of transient spatial stimuli [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283804v2?rss=1</originId><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16235f2f672:1c1cdda:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/17/283804</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283804v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>297a57aa</fingerprint><author><name>Dine, E.

The existing protein complex detection methods can be broadly divided into two categories: unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Most of the unsupervised learning methods assume that protein complexes are in dense regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks even though many true complexes are not dense subgraphs. Supervised learning methods utilize the informative properties of known complexes; they often extract features from existing complexes and then use the features to train a classification model. The trained model is used to guide the search process for new complexes. However, insufficient extracted features, noise in the PPI data and the incompleteness of complex data make the classification model imprecise. Consequently, the classification model is not sufficient for guiding the detection of complexes. Therefore, we propose a new robust score function that combines the classification model with local structural information. Based on the score function, we provide a search method that works both forwards and backwards. The results from experiments on six benchmark PPI datasets and three protein complex datasets show that our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for protein complex detection, occasionally significantly outperforming such methods.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yadong Dong, Yongqi Sun, Chao Qin&lt;/p&gt;

Psychological and other persuasive mechanisms across diverse contexts are well researched, with many studies of the effectiveness of specific persuasive techniques on distinct types of human behaviour. In the present paper, our specific interest lies in the development of a generalized modular psychometric tool to measure individuals’ susceptibility to persuasion. The scale is constructed using items from previously developed and validated particulate scales established in the domains of social psychology and behavioural economics. In the first study we establish the Susceptibility to Persuasion–II (StP-II) scale, containing 54 items, 10 subscales and further 6 sub-sub scales. In Study 2 we establish the scale’s construct validity and reconfirm its reliability.

Psychological and other persuasive mechanisms across diverse contexts are well researched, with many studies of the effectiveness of specific persuasive techniques on distinct types of human behaviour. In the present paper, our specific interest lies in the development of a generalized modular psychometric tool to measure individuals’ susceptibility to persuasion. The scale is constructed using items from previously developed and validated particulate scales established in the domains of social psychology and behavioural economics. In the first study we establish the Susceptibility to Persuasion–II (StP-II) scale, containing 54 items, 10 subscales and further 6 sub-sub scales. In Study 2 we establish the scale’s construct validity and reconfirm its reliability. We present a valid and reliable modular psychometric tool that measures general susceptibility to persuasive techniques. Since its inception, we have successfully implemented the StP-II scale to measure susceptibility to persuasion of IT security officers, the role of psychology of persuasion in cybercrime victims and general persuadability levels of Facebook users; these manuscripts are in preparation. We argue that the StP-II scale shows promise in measuring individual differences in susceptibility to persuasion, and is applicable across diverse contexts such as Internet security and cybercrime.</content></content></item><item><published>1522911600000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>Influence of pathway topology and functional class on the molecular evolution of human metabolic genes [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292714v1?rss=1</originId><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162964c6b49:a54d05e:9f3b30f2</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/05/292714</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292714v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>adf2b3ba</fingerprint><author><name>Montanucci, L.</name></author><crawled>1522940013385</crawled><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292714v1?rss=1</link><description>Metabolic networks comprise thousands of enzymatic reactions functioning in a controlled manner and have been shaped by natural selection. Thanks to the genome data, the footprints of adaptive (positive) selection are detectable, and the strength of purifying selection can be measured. This has made possible to know where, in the metabolic network, adaptive selection has acted and where purifying selection is more or less strong and efficient. We have carried out a comprehensive molecular evolutionary study of all the genes involved in the human metabolism. We investigated the type and strength of the selective pressures that acted on the enzyme-coding genes belonging to metabolic pathways during the divergence of primates and rodents. Then, we related those selective pressures to the functional and topological characteristics of the pathways. We have used DNA sequences of all enzymes (956) of the metabolic pathways comprised in the HumanCyc database, using genome data for humans and five other mammalian species. We have found that the evolution of metabolic genes is primarily constrained by the layer of the metabolism in which the genes participate: while genes encoding enzymes of the inner core of metabolism are much conserved, those encoding enzymes participating in the outer layer, mediating the interaction with the environment, are evolutionarily less constrained and more plastic, having experienced faster functional evolution. Genes that have been targeted by adaptive selection are endowed by higher out-degree centralities than non-adaptive genes, while genes with high in-degree centralities are under stronger purifying selection. When the position along the pathway is considered, a funnel-like distribution of the strength of the purifying selection is found. Genes at bottom positions are highly preserved by purifying selection, whereas genes at top positions, catalyzing the first steps, are open to evolutionary changes. These results show how functional and topological characteristics of metabolic pathways contribute to shape the patterns of evolutionary pressures driven by natural selection and how pathway network structure matters in the evolutionary process that shapes the evolution of the system.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Metabolic networks comprise thousands of enzymatic reactions functioning in a controlled manner and have been shaped by natural selection.

Understanding the regulation of insulin biosynthesis is important as it plays a central role in glucose metabolism. The mouse insulin gene2 (Ins2) has two splice variants; long (Ins2L) and short (Ins2S), that differ only in their 5’UTR sequence and Ins2S is the major transcript which translate more efficiently as compared to Ins2L. Here, we show that cellular factors bind preferentially to the Ins2L 5’UTR, and that PABP and HuD can bind to Ins2 splice variants and regulate its translation. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; binding assay with insulin 5’UTR and different HuD isoforms indicate that the ‘N’ terminal region of HuD is important for RNA binding and insulin translation repression. Using reporter assay we showed that specifically full-length HuD A isoform represses translation of reporter containing insulin 5’UTR. We further show that PABP and HuD interact with each other in RNA-dependent manner and this interaction is affected by glucose and PDI (5’UTR associated translation activator). These results suggest that PABP interacts with HuD in basal glucose conditions making translation inhibitory complex, however upon glucose stimulation this association is affected and PABP is acted upon by PDI resulting in stimulation of insulin translation. Together, our findings snapshot the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of insulin biosynthesis.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Poonam R.

Reactive electrophile species (RES), including prostaglandins, phytoprostanes and 12-oxo phytodienoic acid (OPDA), activate detoxification responses in plants and animals. However, the pathways leading to the activation of defense reactions related to abiotic or biotic stress as a function of RES formation, accumulation or treatment are poorly understood in plants. Here, the thiol-modification of proteins, including the RES-activated basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor TGA2, was studied. TGA2 contains a single cysteine residue (Cys186) that was covalently modified by reactive cyclopentenones but not required for induction of detoxification genes in response to OPDA or prostaglandin A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Reactive electrophile species (RES), including prostaglandins, phytoprostanes and 12-oxo phytodienoic acid (OPDA), activate detoxification responses in plants and animals. However, the pathways leading to the activation of defense reactions related to abiotic or biotic stress as a function of RES formation, accumulation or treatment are poorly understood in plants. Here, the thiol-modification of proteins, including the RES-activated basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor TGA2, was studied. TGA2 contains a single cysteine residue (Cys186) that was covalently modified by reactive cyclopentenones but not required for induction of detoxification genes in response to OPDA or prostaglandin A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Medulloblastoma (MB), the tumor of the cerebellum, is the most frequent brain cancer in childhood and a major cause of pediatric mortality. Based on gene profiling, four MB subgroups have been identified, i.e., Wnt or Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) types, and subgroup 3 or 4. The Shh-type MB has been shown to arise from the cerebellar precursors of granule neurons (GCPs), where a hyperactivation of the Shh pathway leads to their neoplastic transformation. We have previously shown that the gene &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PC3&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Btg2&lt;/i&gt;) inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation and migration of GCPs. Moreover, the overexpression or the deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, a model of spontaneous Shh-type MB, highly reduces or increases, respectively, the frequency of MB. Here we tested whether Tis21 can inhibit MB allografts. Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously grafted with MB cells explanted from &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. MB allografts were then injected with adeno-associated viruses either carrying &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;) or empty (AAV-CBA). We observed that the treatment with AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; significantly inhibited the growth of tumor nodules, as judged by their volume, and reduced the number of proliferating tumor cells (labeled with Ki67 or BrdU), relative to AAV-CBA-treated control mice. In parallel, AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; increased significantly tumor cells labeled with early and late neural differentiation markers. Overall the results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;-gene therapy slows down MB tumor growth through inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neural differentiation. These results validate &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; as a relevant target for MB therapy.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dario Presutti, Manuela Ceccarelli, Laura Micheli, Giuliana Papoff, Simonetta Santini, Simone Samperna, Cristiana Lalli, Lorena Zentilin, Giovina Ruberti, Felice Tirone&lt;/p&gt;

High-temperature thermal contact resistance (TCR) plays an important role in heat-pipe-cooled thermal protection structures due to the existence of contact interface between the embedded heat pipe and the heat resistive structure, and the reduction mechanism of thermal contact resistance is of special interests in the design of such structures. The present paper proposed a finite element model of the high-temperature thermal contact resistance based on the multi-point contact model with the consideration of temperature-dependent material properties, heat radiation through the cavities at the interface and the effect of thermal interface material (TIM), and the geometry parameters of the finite element model are determined by simple surface roughness test and experimental data fitting.

High-temperature thermal contact resistance (TCR) plays an important role in heat-pipe-cooled thermal protection structures due to the existence of contact interface between the embedded heat pipe and the heat resistive structure, and the reduction mechanism of thermal contact resistance is of special interests in the design of such structures. The present paper proposed a finite element model of the high-temperature thermal contact resistance based on the multi-point contact model with the consideration of temperature-dependent material properties, heat radiation through the cavities at the interface and the effect of thermal interface material (TIM), and the geometry parameters of the finite element model are determined by simple surface roughness test and experimental data fitting. The experimental results of high-temperature thermal contact resistance between superalloy GH600 and C/C composite material are employed to validate the present finite element model. The effect of the crucial parameters on the thermal contact resistance with and without TIM are also investigated with the proposed finite element model.</content></content></item><item><published>1521010800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nature25966-f1.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>562</height><width>685</width></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Dysregulation of expression correlates with rare-allele burden and fitness loss in maize</title><engagement>210</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25966</originId><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16225bc9b6e:4f89e0:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25966</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>65f76080</fingerprint><author><name>Karl A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Respectful and dignified healthcare is a fundamental right for every woman. However, many women seeking childbirth services, especially those in low-income countries such as Pakistan, are mistreated by their birth attendants. The aim of this epidemiological study was to estimate the prevalence of mistreatment and types of mistreatment among women giving birth in facility- and home-based settings in Pakistan in order to address the lack of empirical evidence on this topic. The study also examined the association between demographics (socio-demographic, reproductive history and empowerment status) and mistreatment, both in general and according to birth setting (whether home- or facility-based).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;In phase one, we identified 24 mistreatment indicators through an extensive literature review. We then pre-tested these indicators and classified them into seven behavioural types. During phase two, the survey was conducted (April-May 2013) in 14 districts across Pakistan. A total of 1,334 women who had given birth at home or in a healthcare facility over the past 12 months were interviewed. Linear regression analysis was employed for the full data set, and for facility- and home-based births separately, using Stata version 14.1.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in manifestations of mistreatment between facility- and home-based childbirths. Approximately 97% of women reported experiencing at least one disrespectful and abusive behaviour. Experiences of mistreatment by type were as follows: non-consented care (81%); right to information (72%); non-confidential care (69%); verbal abuse (35%); abandonment of care (32%); discriminatory care (15%); and physical abuse (15%). In overall analysis, experience of mistreatment was lower among women who were unemployed (β = -1.17, 95% CI -1.81, -0.53); and higher among less empowered women (β = 0.11, 95% CI 0.06, 0.16); and those assisted by a traditional birth attendant as opposed to a general physician (β = 0.94, 95% CI 0.13, 1.75). Sub-group analyses for home-based births identified the same significant associations with mistreatment, with ethnicity included. In facility-based births, there was a significant relationship between women’s employment and empowerment status and mistreatment. Women with prior education on birth preparedness were less likely to experience mistreatment compared to those who had received no previous birth preparedness education.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In order to promote care that is woman-centred and provided in a respectful and culturally appropriate manner, service providers should be cognisant of the current situation and ensure provision of quality antenatal care. At the community level, women should seek antenatal care for improved birth preparedness, while at the interpersonal level strategies should be devised to leverage women’s ability to participate in key household decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Waqas Hameed, Bilal Iqbal Avan&lt;/p&gt;

They’ve been working with various heme proteins, since that reactive center is known to be able to generate carbenes, and they noted one variant, in the presence of ethyl diazoacetate as a carbene source and an aryl acetylene as reactant, gave furan products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo-300x92.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo-300x92.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Bicyclo.jpeg 526w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13437&quot; height=&quot;92&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are already reported as coming from a carbene mechanism, so the group thought that they must be on to something. Further screening of variants around that particular enzyme isoform turned up some that allowed a second carbene reaction to cycle around, giving the unusual bicyclobutanes shown at right. Freeing up some room around the active site was essential, otherwise the cyclopropene intermediate goes off to the furan product instead. A systematic screen of amino acid variations at the key residues of the enzyme in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, with monitoring of product production, furnished an enzyme that was capable of high turnover (enough to produce hundreds of milligrams of product). A variety of different R groups are tolerated on the phenyl, with yields from 30 to 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene-300x85.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene-300x85.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Cyclopropene.jpeg 382w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13438&quot; height=&quot;85&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the phenylcyclopropene intermediate was not isolable, but the team also look for variants that could produce those products as well (in the non-aryl cases). Similar mutation screens against promising enzymes produced another one that could indeed furnish a variety of cyclopropenes, as shown at right, in yields of 35 to 85%. Variants were found that could produced enhanced ratios of either enantiomer, to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sorts of reactions are known in the literature, up to a point (here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccc.chem.pitt.edu/wipf/Topics/Maciej.pdf&quot;&gt;review presentation&lt;/a&gt; from the Wipf group a few years back on the topic). But such things are mostly seen on very electron-deficient alkynes and often go in lower yields than what are reported here (and I think you can largely forget about enantioselectivity). The fact that enzymes can be made to do such chemistry is remarkable, and there are surely many more such things waiting to be discovered. The metal centers in these proteins do a lot of extraordinary chemistry, and many groups are in the process of harnessing them for synthetic purposes. Seeing unusual strained systems like this being formed so readily just shows how much must be possible!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/10/21st-century-enzymes</href></item></alternate></item><item><published>1522134000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>True</unread><title>Network-Based Biomarkers Enable Cross-Disease Biomarker Discovery [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289934v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626967e384:6423c39:7d6c1c1c</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/289934</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289934v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>a6fda01d</fingerprint><author><name>Haider, S.</name></author><crawled>1522186838916</crawled><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/289934v1?rss=1</link><description>Biomarkers lie at the heart of precision medicine, biodiversity monitoring, agricultural pathogen detection, amongst others.

We have previously characterized Pir32, a &lt;i&gt;Candia albicans&lt;/i&gt; cell wall protein that we found to be involved in filamentation, virulence, chitin deposition, and resistance to oxidative stress. Other than defining the cell shape, the cell wall is critical for the interaction with the surrounding environment and the point of contact and interaction with the host surface. In this study, we applied tandem mass spectrometry combined with bioinformatics to investigate cell wall proteome changes in a &lt;i&gt;pir32&lt;/i&gt; null strain. A total of 16 and 25 proteins were identified exclusively in the null mutant strains grown under non-filamentous and filamentous conditions. These proteins included members of the PGA family with various functions, lipase and the protease involved in virulence, superoxide dismutases required for resisting oxidative stress, alongside proteins required for cell wall remodeling and synthesis such as Ssr1, Xog1, Dfg5 and Dcw1. In addition proteins needed for filamentation like Cdc42, Ssu81 and Ucf1, and other virulence proteins such as Als3, Rbt5, and Csa2 were also detected. The detection of these proteins in the mutant and their lack of detection in the wild type can explain the differential phenotypes previously observed.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pamela El Khoury, Andy Awad, Brigitte Wex, Roy A.

Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms play a pivotal role in the regulation of numerous cellular functions, making them extensively studied and highly attractive drug targets.

structural modeling and design. The
comparison of differently derived energy functions enables analysis of the
strengths and weaknesses of each energy function, and provides independent
benchmarks for evaluating improvements within a given energy function. We compared the molecular mechanics Amber
empirical energy function to two versions of the Rosetta energy function
(talaris2014 and REF2015) in decoy discrimination and loop modeling tests. Both
Rosetta&apos;s talaris2014 and Amber&apos;s ff14SBonlySC energy functions performed well
in scoring the native state as the lowest energy conformation in many cases. In 24/150 cases with Rosetta, and in 2/150
cases using Amber, a false minimum is found that is absent in the alternative
landscape. In 21/150 cases, both energy function-generated landscapes featured
false minima. The newest version of the Rosetta energy function, REF2015, which
has more physically-derived terms than talaris2014, performs significantly
better, highlighting the improvements made to the Rosetta scoring approach. To
take advantage of the semi-orthogonal nature of these energy functions, we developed
a Pareto optimization approach that combines Amber and Rosetta energy

structural modeling and design. The
comparison of differently derived energy functions enables analysis of the
strengths and weaknesses of each energy function, and provides independent
benchmarks for evaluating improvements within a given energy function. We compared the molecular mechanics Amber
empirical energy function to two versions of the Rosetta energy function
(talaris2014 and REF2015) in decoy discrimination and loop modeling tests. Both
Rosetta&apos;s talaris2014 and Amber&apos;s ff14SBonlySC energy functions performed well
in scoring the native state as the lowest energy conformation in many cases. In 24/150 cases with Rosetta, and in 2/150
cases using Amber, a false minimum is found that is absent in the alternative
landscape. In 21/150 cases, both energy function-generated landscapes featured
false minima. The newest version of the Rosetta energy function, REF2015, which
has more physically-derived terms than talaris2014, performs significantly
better, highlighting the improvements made to the Rosetta scoring approach. To
take advantage of the semi-orthogonal nature of these energy functions, we developed
a Pareto optimization approach that combines Amber and Rosetta energy
landscapes to predict the most near-native model for a given protein. This algorithm
improves upon predictions from either energy function in isolation, and should
aid in model selection for structure prediction and loop modeling tasks.</description><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords></item><item><published>1522306800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03421-7/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3421_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height><width>661</width></visual><unread>True</unread><title>Chronic nicotinamide riboside supplementation is well-tolerated and elevates NAD+ in healthy middle-aged and older adults</title><engagement>394</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03421-7</originId><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1627110dea7:71959cd:9f3b30f2</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03421-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/8NJ1u2xjWZA/s41467-018-03421-7</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>28975c83</fingerprint><author><name>Christopher R.

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system to bimolecular complementation (‘EM split-fluorescent protein’), for localisation of protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrmHIECypRw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

Background &lt;p&gt;The use of iodine-based contrast agents entails the risk of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Radiocontrast agents elicit the third most common cause of nephropathy among hospitalized patients, accounting for 11–12% of cases. CIN is connected with clinically significant consequences, including increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of complications, potential need for dialysis, and increased mortality rate. The number of in-hospital examinations using iodine-based contrast media has been significantly increasing over the last decade. In order to protect patients from possible complications of such examinations, new biomarkers are needed that are able to predict a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Urinary and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations are influenced by renal function. Urinary cGMP is primarily of renal cellular origin. Therefore, we assessed if urinary cGMP concentration may predict major adverse renal events (MARE) after contrast media exposure during coronary angiography.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Urine samples were prospectively collected from non-randomized consecutive patients with either diabetes or preexisting impaired kidney function receiving intra-arterial contrast medium (CM) for emergent or elective coronary angiography at the Charité Campus Mitte, University Hospital Berlin. Urinary cGMP concentration in spot urine was analyzed 24 hours after CM exposure. Patients were followed up over 90 days for occurrence of death, initiation of dialysis, doubling of plasma creatinine concentration or MARE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 289 consecutive patients were included into the study. Urine cGMP/creatinine ratio 24 hours before CM exposure expressed as mean±SD was predictive for the need of dialysis (no dialysis: 89.77±92.85 μM/mM, n = 277; need for dialysis: 140.3±82.90 μM/mM, n = 12, p = 0.008), death (no death during follow-up: 90.60±92.50 μM/mM, n = 280; death during follow-up: 169.88±81.52 μM/mM, n = 9; p = 0.002), and the composite endpoint MARE (no MARE: 86.02±93.17 μM/mM, n = 271; MARE: 146.64±74.68 μM/mM, n = 18, p&amp;lt;0.001) during the follow-up of 90 days after contrast media application. cGMP/creatinine ratio stayed significantly increased at values exceeding 120 μM/mM in patients who developed MARE, required dialysis or died.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary cGMP/creatinine ratio ≥ 120 μM/mM before CM exposure is a promising biomarker for the need of dialysis and all-cause mortality 90 days after CM exposure in patients with preexisting renal impairment or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lyubov Chaykovska, Fabian Heunisch, Gina von Einem, Carl-Friedrich Hocher, Oleg Tsuprykov, Mira Pavkovic, Peter Sandner, Axel Kretschmer, Chang Chu, Saban Elitok, Johannes-Peter Stasch, Berthold Hocher&lt;/p&gt;

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hb&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA or protein.

Natural reservoirs of &lt;i&gt;Yersinia (Y&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;) enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; comprise different animal species, but little is known about the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of yersiniosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218). The remaining 18 isolates belonged to bio-serotypes 1B/NI (3/218, 1.4%), 1B/O:8 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/NI (6/218, 2.8%), 2/O:27 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:9 (2/218, 0.9%), 3/NI (2/218, 0.9%), 4/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%) and 4/O:9 (1/218, 0.5%).

P5B ATPases are present in the genomes of diverse unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, indicating that they have an ancient origin, and that they are important for cellular fitness. Inactivation of ATP13A2, one of the four human P5B ATPases, leads to early-onset Parkinson’s disease (Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome). The presence of an invariant PPALP motif within the putative substrate interaction pocket of transmembrane segment M4 suggests that all P5B ATPases might have similar transport specificity; however, the identity of the transport substrate(s) remains unknown. Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis possess three paralogous P5B ATPase genes, &lt;i&gt;catp-5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;catp-6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-7&lt;/i&gt;, which probably originated from a single ancestral gene around the time of origin of the Caenorhabditid clade. By using CRISPR/Cas9, we have systematically investigated the expression patterns, subcellular localization and biological functions of each of the P5B ATPases of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We find that each gene has a unique expression pattern, and that some tissues express more than one P5B. In some tissues where their expression patterns overlap, different P5Bs are targeted to different subcellular compartments (e.g., early endosomes vs. plasma membrane), whereas in other tissues they localize to the same compartment (plasma membrane). We observed lysosomal co-localization between CATP-6::GFP and LMP-1::RFP in transgenic animals; however, this was an artifact of the tagged LMP-1 protein, since anti-LMP-1 antibody staining of native protein revealed that LMP-1 and CATP-6::GFP occupy different compartments. The nematode P5Bs are at least partially redundant, since we observed synthetic sterility in &lt;i&gt;catp-5(0); catp-6(0)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-6(0) catp-7(0)&lt;/i&gt; double mutants. The double mutants exhibit defects in distal tip cell migration that resemble those of &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt; (alpha integrin ortholog) and &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; (Pax6 ortholog) mutants, suggesting that the nematode P5Bs are required for &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt;and/or &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; function. This is potentially a conserved regulatory interaction, since mammalian ATP13A2, alpha integrin and Pax6 are all required for proper dopaminergic neuron function.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jeffrey Zielich, Elena Tzima, Eva Ayla Schröder, Faten Jemel, Barbara Conradt, Eric J.

The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and its version for groups (TSST-G) are the gold standard for inducing acute psychosocial stress in human experimental settings and have been used in numerous studies since the early 1990s. The TSST and the TSST-G lead to effects on different physiological and psychological markers, such as salivary cortisol, anxiety, and emotional states. These effects were assessed with quantitative methods comparing pre-test and post-test measures with statistical analyses. But to date, no qualitative analyses have been conducted to examine the meaningful experience of participants during the TSST and the TSST-G. This study is the first to conduct qualitative investigations to further clarify the stressful experience of participants confronted with these procedures. Preliminary results showed as expected that the TSST and the TSST-G effectively induced psychosocial stress, with cortisol levels, cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and arousal increases, and with pleasure and dominance decreases. At the qualitative level, the results evidenced that the two theoretically stressful components of the TSST and the TSST-G, namely social-evaluative threat and uncontrollability, were experienced as stress-inducing by the participants. Two case studies confirmed these findings. But the results also showed on one hand that psychosocial stress is a dynamic phenomenon, with important fluctuations throughout the tasks (mainly for the TSST-G); and on the other hand that despite the similar physiological and psychological responses between the TSST and the TSST-G evidenced by the literature, the experience of the participants was both similar and specific. Use of a qualitative method allowed us to provide a complementary point of view to understand the meaningful experience of participants during these stressful procedures, apprehending the dynamic of the subjective stress experience without disrupting it.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Olivier Vors, Tanguy Marqueste, Nicolas Mascret&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, an increasing popularity of marathons has been seen. Although running has been shown to have considerable positive health effects, the risk of sudden death, most often due to sudden cardiac arrests, is also a risk runners expose themselves to. Whilst there are some studies on the mortality amongst long-distance runners, much of the evidence is dated. Given the increased popularity in running during the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century as well as the improvements in medical care at marathons, more knowledge is required on the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and method &lt;p&gt;Publicly available racing and news databases were used to identify the number of entrants and finishers in half to full marathons in Sweden between 2007 and 2016 and the number of deaths that occurred in conjunction with the races.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,156,271 runners entered a long distance (21-42km) running race in Sweden between 2007 and 2016, and 834,412 runners finished the races (72.2%). A large majority of the finishers (677,050 (81%)) competed in distances under a full marathon. Two deaths occurred during the time period, meaning that the death rate was 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.04–0.79) per 100,000 finishers.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study can show that death rates in long distance running races between 2007 and 2016 in Sweden are very low, compared to previous studies. When added to the existing literature, the combined picture suggests a general downward trend in the risk of death during marathons since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Finn Nilson, Mats Börjesson&lt;/p&gt;

When added to the existing literature, the combined picture suggests a general downward trend in the risk of death during marathons since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><published>1521529200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>False</unread><title>Models that learn how humans learn: the case of depression and bipolar disorders [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/285221v1?rss=1</originId><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16245105e41:31210fb:34f43e70</id><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/20/285221</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/285221v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>747bd3d7</fingerprint><author><name>Dezfouli, A.</name></author><crawled>1521577123393</crawled><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/285221v1?rss=1</link><description>Computational models of learning and decision-making processes in the brain play an important role in many domains.

Although tau pathology, behavioral deficits, and neuronal loss are observed in patients with tauopathies, the relationship between these endpoints has not been clearly established. Here we found that rTg4510 mice, which overexpress human mutant tau in the forebrain, develop progressive age-dependent increases in locomotor activity (LMA), which correlates with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, hyperphosphorylated tau levels, and brain atrophy. To further clarify the relationship between these endpoints, we treated the rTg4510 mice with either doxycycline to reduce mutant tau expression or an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet G, which has been shown to ameliorate tau pathology in animal models. We found that both doxycycline and Thiamet G treatments starting at 2 months of age prevented the progression of hyperactivity, slowed brain atrophy, and reduced brain hyperphosphorylated tau. In contrast, initiating doxycycline treatment at 4 months reduced neither brain hyperphosphorylated tau nor hyperactivity, further confirming the relationship between these measures. Collectively, our results demonstrate a unique behavioral phenotype in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy that strongly correlates with disease progression, and that early interventions which reduce tau pathology ameliorate the progression of the locomotor dysfunction. These findings suggest that better understanding the relationship between locomotor deficits and tau pathology in the rTg4510 model may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral disturbances in patients with tauopathies.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaohai Wang, Karen Smith, Michelle Pearson, Anna Hughes, Mali L.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the range, nature, and extent of current research activity exploring the influence of innovative health-related technologies on social inequalities in health, with specific focus on a deeper understanding of the variables used to measure this connection and the pathways leading to the (re)production of inequalities. A review process was conducted, based on scoping review techniques, searching literature published from January 1, 1996 to November 25, 2016 using MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Search, sorting, and data extraction processes were conducted by a team of researchers and experts using a dynamic, reflexive examination process. Of 4139 studies collected from the search process, a total of 33 were included in the final analysis. Results of this study include the classification of technologies based on how these technologies are accessed and used by end users. In addition to the factors and mechanisms that influence unequal &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to technologies, the results of this study highlight the importance of variations in &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; that importantly shape social inequalities in health. Additionally, focus on health care services technologies must be accompanied by investigating emerging technologies influencing healthy lifestyle, genomics, and personalized devices in health. Findings also suggest that choosing one measure of social position over another has important implications for the interpretation of research results. Furthermore, understanding the pathways through which various innovative health technologies reduce or (re)produce social inequalities in health is context dependent. In order to better understand social inequalities in health, these contextual variations draw attention to the need for critical distinctions between technologies based on how these various technologies are accessed and used. The results of this study provide a comprehensive starting point for future research to further investigate how innovative technologies may influence the unequal distribution of health as a human right.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Weiss, Håvard T.

Investigation of human diet during the Neolithic has often been limited to a few archaeological cultures or single sites. In order to provide insight into the development of human food consumption and husbandry strategies, our study explores bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 466 human and 105 faunal individuals from 26 sites in central Germany. It is the most extensive data set to date from an enclosed geographic microregion, covering 4,000 years of agricultural history from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The animal data show that a variety of pastures and dietary resources were explored, but that these changed remarkably little over time. In the human &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N however we found a significant increase with time across the different archaeological cultures. This trend could be observed in all time periods and archaeological cultures (Bell Beaker phenomenon excluded), even on continuously populated sites. Since there was no such trend in faunal isotope values, we were able largely to exclude manuring as the cause of this effect. Based on the rich interdisciplinary data from this region and archaeological period we can argue that meat consumption increased with the increasing duration of farming subsistence.
In &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, we could not observe any clear increasing or decreasing trends during the archaeological time periods, either for humans or for animals, which would have suggested significant changes in the environment and landscape use. We discovered sex-related dietary differences, with males of all archaeological periods having higher &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N values than females, and an age-related increasing consumption of animal protein. An initial decrease of &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-values at the age of 1–2 years reveals partial weaning, while complete weaning took place at the age of 3–4 years.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Angelina Münster, Corina Knipper, Vicky M.

An initial decrease of &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-values at the age of 1–2 years reveals partial weaning, while complete weaning took place at the age of 3–4 years.</content></content></item><item><published>1522962000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</canonicalUrl><updated>1522962000000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460d:34f43e70</id><title>Medication and trial duration influence postural and pointing parameters during a standing repetitive pointing task in individuals with Parkinson’s disease</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>15afb55e</fingerprint><author><name>Deborah A.

We aimed to determine the effects of levodopa medication on the performance of a repetitive pointing task while standing, and to investigate the optimal trial duration in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, and older adults. Seventeen individuals with Parkinson’s disease (5 freezers) and 9 older adults stood on force platforms for 30 s and 120 s while performing a bilateral repetitive pointing task, tracked by motion capture. Participants with Parkinson’s disease were assessed on and off medication and older adults were also assessed on separate days. The main findings were that: 1) on medication, participants with Parkinson’s exhibited greater center of pressure root mean square in the medial-lateral direction, greater velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions, and greater range in the medial-lateral direction than off medication; 2) longer trial durations resulted in greater center of pressure range in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and greater coefficient of variation in finger pointing on the least affected side; 3) Parkinson’s participants exhibited larger range in the medial-lateral direction compared to older adults; 4) off medication, freezers presented with less range and root mean square in the anterior-posterior direction than non-freezers; and 5) a correlation emerged between the freezing of gait questionnaire and pointing asymmetry and the coefficient of variation of pointing on the most affected side. Therefore, Parkinson’s medication may increase instability during a repetitive pointing task. Longer trials may provide a better depiction of sway by discriminating between those with and without neurological impairment. Individuals with Parkinson’s were less stable than older adults, supporting that they are at a greater risk for falls. The greater restrictive postural strategy in freezers compared to non-freezers is likely a factor that augments fall-risk. Lastly, the link between freezing of gait and upper-limb movement indicates that freezing may manifest first in the lower-limbs.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Deborah A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Data are lacking on the risk and impact of a serious hemorrhage on the prognosis after ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aimed to estimate the incidence of serious hemorrhage, analyze the impact on mortality, and identify predictors of hemorrhage after discharge from IS or TIA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;All patients admitted to Östersund Hospital for an IS or TIA in 2010–2013 were included (n = 1528, mean age: 75.1 years). Serious hemorrhages were identified until 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2015. Incidence rates were calculated. The impact on mortality (stratified by functional level) was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Non-parametric estimation under the assumption of competing risk was performed to assess the cumulative incidence and predictors of serious hemorrhages.The incidence rates of serious (n = 113) and intracranial hemorrhages (n = 45) after discharge from IS and TIA were 2.48% and 0.96% per year at risk, respectively. Patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 3–5 exhibited 58.9% mortality during follow-up and those with mRS scores of 0–2 exhibited 18.4% mortality. A serious hemorrhage did not affect mortality in patients with impaired functional status, but it increased the risk of death in patients with mRS scores of 0–2. Hypertension was associated with increased risk of serious hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found that, after discharge from an IS or TIA, serious hemorrhages were fairly common. Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability. Improved hypertension treatment may decrease the risk of serious hemorrhage, but in patients with low functional status, poor survival makes secondary prevention challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joachim Ögren, Anna-Lotta Irewall, Lars Söderström, Thomas Mooe&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to gain insight into the physiological changes occurring in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) after autogenic drainage (AD). Changes in respiratory system resistance (Rrs), reactance (Xrs), and spirometry were analyzed in adult CF subjects after a single AD physiotherapy session.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective observational study was conducted during the annual check-up of adult CF subjects in stable condition. Spirometry and Rrs and Xrs measurements using the forced oscillations technique at 5, 11, and 19 hertz (Hz) were performed before and 30 min after a 20-min AD session. Control CF subjects were tested at baseline and 50 min without AD. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median [interquartile range].&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty subjects were included in the physiotherapy group (age 29 [25–34] years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 40.3 [30.1–57.9]% predicted) and 11 in the control group (age 31 [28.5–36.5] years, FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 43.6 [31.1–51.9] % predicted). No significant changes in any parameter were observed in the control group. AD modestly but significantly increased the forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (p&amp;lt;0.001). Inspiratory resistance was also significantly improved by AD: Rrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; from 5.74±2.39 to 5.24±2.17 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L/s, p&amp;lt;0.05; Rrs&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; from 4.83±1.98 to 4.32±1.7 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L/s, p = 0.003; and Rrs&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; from 4.18 [3.46–5.07] to 3.86 [2.76–4.98] cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L/s, p&amp;lt;0.001. In contrast, AD had no significant effects on frequency dependence of resistance (Rrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;–Rrs&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;) or expiratory resistance. Inspiratory Xrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, but not ΔXrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (expiratory—inspiratory Xrs), was improved by AD (p&amp;lt;0.05).

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41–50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51–67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tadeja Kuret, Katja Lakota, Polonca Mali, Saša Čučnik, Sonja Praprotnik, Matija Tomšič, Snezna Sodin-Semrl&lt;/p&gt;

Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41–50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51–67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.</content></content></item><item><published>1520812800000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><unread>False</unread><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The postembryonic brain exhibits experience-dependent development, in which sensory experience guides normal brain growth.

Bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality with rates varying from 10–25% and higher. Appropriate and timely onset of antibiotic therapy influences the prognosis of these patients. It requires the diagnostic accuracy which is not afforded by current gold standards such as blood culture. Moreover, the time from blood sampling to blood culture results is a key determinant of reducing mortality. No established biomarkers exist which can differentiate bloodstream infections from other systemic inflammatory conditions. This calls for studies on biomarkers potential of molecular profiling of plasma as it is affected most by the molecular changes accompanying bloodstream infections. N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification which is very sensitive to changes in physiology. Here we have performed targeted quantitative N-glycoproteomics from plasma samples of patients with confirmed positive blood culture together with age and sex matched febrile controls with negative blood culture reports. Three hundred and sixty eight potential N-glycopeptides were quantified by mass spectrometry and 149 were further selected for identification. Twenty four N-glycopeptides were identified with high confidence together with elucidation of the peptide sequence, N-glycosylation site, glycan composition and proposed glycan structures. Principal component analysis, orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (S-Plot) and self-organizing maps clustering among other statistical methods were employed to analyze the data. These methods gave us clear separation of the two patient classes. We propose high-confidence N-glycopeptides which have the power to separate the bloodstream infections from blood culture negative febrile patients and shed light on host response during bacteremia. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD009048.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sakari Joenvaara, Mayank Saraswat, Pentti Kuusela, Shruti Saraswat, Rahul Agarwal, Johanna Kaartinen, Asko Järvinen, Risto Renkonen&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;In urban Maharashtra, India, approximately half of mothers exclusively breastfeed. For children residing in informal settlements of Mumbai, this study examines factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding, and whether exclusive breastfeeding, in a community-based nutrition program to prevent and treat wasting among children under age three, is associated with enrolment during the mother’s pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The nutrition program conducted a cross-sectional endline survey (October-December 2015) of caregivers in intervention areas. Factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding for infants under six months of age were explored using multi-level logistic regressions. Additionally, program surveillance data collected during home-based counselling visits documented breastfeeding practices for children under six months of age. Using the surveillance data (January 2014-March 2016), exclusive breastfeeding status was regressed adjusting for child, maternal and socioeconomic characteristics, and whether the child was enrolled in the program in utero or after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The community-based endline survey included 888 mothers of infants. Mothers who received the nutrition program home visits or attended group counselling sessions were more likely to exclusively breastfeed (adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.16, 2.41). Having a normal weight-for-height z-score (adjusted odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.00, 2.45) was associated positively with exclusive breastfeeding. As expected, being an older infant aged three to five months (adjusted odds ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25, 0.48) and receiving a prelacteal feed after birth (adjusted odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.41, 0.80) were associated with lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding. Surveillance data (N = 3420) indicate that infants enrolled in utero have significantly higher odds of being exclusively breastfed (adjusted odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.30, 1.84) than infants enrolled after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Prenatal enrolment in community-based programs working on child nutrition in urban informal settlements of India can improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sheila Chanani, Anagha Waingankar, Neena Shah More, Shanti Pantvaidya, Armida Fernandez, Anuja Jayaraman&lt;/p&gt;

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-1 family with multiple context dependent functions. We and others have shown that HIV infection is accompanied by increased circulating levels of IL-18 along with decreased levels of its antagonist, Interleukin-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP). The infection is also accompanied by intestinal inflammation and decreased intestinal integrity as measured by intestinal permeability, regeneration and repair. However, little is known concerning the relation between high level of IL-18 associated with the viral infection and intestinal permeability. Here we demonstrate that HIV treatment increases production of IL-18 and decreases that of IL-18BP production in human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. IL-18 causes apoptosis of the IEC by activating caspase-1 and caspase-3. It induces epithelial barrier hyperpermeability by decreasing and disrupting both tight and adherens junction proteins, occludin, claudin 2 and beta-catenin. Disorganization of F-actin was also observed in the IEC that were exposed to the cytokine. Moreover IL-18 decreases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Caco-2 and increases permeability in HT29 monolayers. The cells’ treatment with IL-18 causes an increase in the expression of phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light-chain (p-MLC) and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and a decrease in phosphorylated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (p-STAT)-5. This increase in p-MLC is suppressed by a Rho-kinase (ROCK)-specific inhibitor. Interestingly, the levels of the cytokine correlate with those of LPS in the circulation in three different categories of HIV infected patients (HAART-naïve and HAART-treated HIV-infected individuals, and Elite controls) as well as in healthy controls. Collectively, these results suggest that the HIV-induced IL-18 plays a role in increased intestinal permeability and microbial translocation observed in HIV-infected individuals.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ossama Allam, Suzanne Samarani, Vikram Mehraj, Mohammad-Ali Jenabian, Cecile Tremblay, Jean-Pierre Routy, Devendra Amre, Ali Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the effects of dopaminergic interventions on pain remains questionable. This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed at exploring the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain evoked by cold stimulation and on spontaneous pain in patients with lumbar radicular (neuropathic) pain.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data was collected from 35 patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (18 men, mean age 56.2±13 years). The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In addition, apomorphine prolonged cold pain tolerance but not threshold in the painful site (from a median of 43.0 seconds (IQR = 63.0) at baseline to 51.0 seconds (IQR = 78.0) at 120 min, p = 0.02). Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by May Haddad, Dorit Pud, Roi Treister, Erica Suzan, Elon Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Many physical simulations aim at evaluating the net interaction between two rigid bodies, resulting from the cumulative effect of pairwise interactions between their constituents. This is manifested particularly in biomolecular applications such as hierarchical protein folding instances where the interaction between almost rigid domains directly influences the folding pathway, the interaction between macromolecules for drug design purposes, self-assembly of nanoparticles for drug design and drug delivery, and design of smart materials and bio-sensors. In general, the brute force approach requires quadratic (in terms of the number of particles) number of pairwise evaluation operations for any relative pose of the two bodies, unless simplifying assumptions lead to a collapse of the computational complexity. We propose to approximate the pairwise interaction function using a linear predictor function, in which the basis functions have separated forms, i.e. the variables that describe local geometries of the two rigid bodies and the ones that reflect the relative pose between them are split in each basis function. Doing so replaces the quadratic number of interaction evaluations for each relative pose with a one-time quadratic computation of a set of characteristic parameters at a preprocessing step, plus constant number of pose function evaluations at each pose, where this constant is determined by the required accuracy of approximation as well as the efficiency of the used approximation method. We will show that the standard deviation of the error for the net interaction is linearly (in terms of number of particles) proportional to the regression error, if the regression errors are from a normal distribution. Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pouya Tavousi&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of those questions that improves on further inspection – or deteriorates, according to your point of view, because it just keeps on getting more complicated. For decades, there was no good answer at all, but then there was “It reduces signaling in the inflammation pathways”, followed by “OK, it seems to do that by decreasing this prostaglandin signaling molecule” and “Ah, it does that by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, a key enzyme in the pathway to make those”. Then we moved to “Hold it, there’s more than one cyclooxygenase”, which is how we ended up with the COX-2 inhibitors like Vioxx, which led to “You know, the functions of these two are more complicated than we even thought”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on top of all these, there are clearly effects of NSAID drugs that have nothing to do with the COX enzymes at all. Blood clotting you can pretty much chalk up to the COX isoforms, but there are more things going on, and they’re very poorly defined. Which brings up a more general question: how do you ever know about all the things that a small-molecule drug might be doing in a living system? The answer is, you don’t. That’s not generally appreciated outside the biomedical professions, but it’s the truth. We don’t have some way to track things around and watch them interact at a molecule level through out a cell or an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. Mapping compound-protein interactions is a big part of chemical biology, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b11639&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Woo lab at Harvard shows an attempt to track small molecules in just this way. It uses photoaffinity labeling, via the now-nearly-standard combination tag of a diazirine and an acetylene, which lets you form a covalent bond to (most) of the thing the molecule of interest is spending time next to, and on the back end of the process, it uses isotope-labeled tags on the acetylene-click-conjugation step to give the mass spec detection a much higher signal/noise. Just digging through the whole cellular proteome without the kind of validation that isotope tagging gives you is a tall order, but the deliberately-weird-mass-combination effect of the stable isotope tags moves things up out of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three NSAIDs are given the treatment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen&quot;&gt;naproxen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib&quot;&gt;celecoxib&lt;/a&gt; (Celebrex), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin&quot;&gt;indomethacin&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a good spread of activity: naproxen hits both COX-1 and COX-2 pretty much equally, celecoxib is of course a COX-2 selective compound, and indomethacin is in a structurally distinct class that’s already known to have some other modes of action. &lt;em&gt;(Update:&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja408322b&quot;&gt; here’s work&lt;/a&gt; from another group on an alkyne-tagged aspirin derivative, which also interacts with a long list of cellular proteins).&lt;/em&gt; All the photolabel-derivatized compounds were still active against COX enzymes (albeit with somewhat lower affinity), and all of them could be displaced by the parent compounds in competition assays. All of them photo-labeled COX-2 in an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiment, as they certainly should, and this experiment was used to validate the mass spec analysis methods for the whole-cell experiments. (For example, each of these compounds produces six or seven different photoadducts, depending on which nearby amino acid gets snagged by the reactive carbene that forms from the diazirene, and the group was able to see and account for all of these without difficulty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens in cells? They tried the dosing/photolabeling experiment in Jurkat cells, along with experiments with photoactive negative control (non-NSAID) compounds. About 700 proteins were labeled in all, with quite a bit of overlap between the three NSAIDs (40% of them are hit by all three), and that figure alone should make a person stop and think a bit: &lt;em&gt;as simple and widely used a molecule as naproxen binds to hundreds of proteins well enough to photolabel them&lt;/em&gt;. No, we don’t know the details of what’s going on in there, do we? Admittedly, that’s at a high concentration (250 micromolar), but (1) patients take whopping doses of this stuff in the real world, and (2) the majority of these interactions also showed up at a 50 micromolar dose as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same set of experiments was also run in K562 cells, a leukemia line. In this case, there were 513 enriched protein targets and &lt;em&gt;only 206 of them overlapped&lt;/em&gt; with the set from the Jurkat cells. And that’s also something to think about – not only do small, well-known compounds like these interact with a long list of proteins, that list can change dramatically in different cell backgrounds. Only about 30% of the total list of proteins have ever been report to interact with any small molecules at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of these doesn’t show any particular compartmentalization effects in the cells; it pretty much tracks protein abundance across the cytoplasm, various organelles, nucleus and so on. A closer look at the proteins and their interaction sites can be found in the paper, but one thing worth mentioning is a “hot spot” in histone H2A, which is certainly not a target that anyone had been thinking about for NSAIDs, to my knowledge. Assigning all the specific sites of labeling across the proteome is still beyond current technology, although you can think of some experiments that would help narrow things down a lot (different protein digestion before the mass spec, and so on). But even at this level – which is more detailed than we’ve ever had for such compounds – there’s a lot to deal with here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you needed a reminder about just what a complicated mixing bowl we’re throwing our compounds into, here you go. The hope is that such techniques and the ungodly huge piles of data that they generate will help up build up a clearer picture of drug action. But what a picture that’s going to be!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/16/more-proteins-than-you-ever-thought</href></item></alternate></item><item><published>1521740379000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><title>How green is burning wood?</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:415042e:9f3b30f2</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-m?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1373.13.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-m?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>2f74d7ec</fingerprint><author><name>Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, J.</name></author><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-m?rss=1</link></item><item><published>1521061200000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194373</canonicalUrl><updated>1521061200000</updated><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194373</originId><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e33a0:9f3b30f2</id><title>Alluvial substrate mapping by automated texture segmentation of recreational-grade side scan sonar imagery</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194373</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>93af166</fingerprint><author><name>Daniel Hamill</name></author><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194373</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Hamill, Daniel Buscombe, Joseph M.

Side scan sonar in low-cost ‘fishfinder’ systems has become popular in aquatic ecology and sedimentology for imaging submerged riverbed sediment at coverages and resolutions sufficient to relate bed texture to grain-size. Traditional methods to map bed texture (i.e. physical samples) are relatively high-cost and low spatial coverage compared to sonar, which can continuously image several kilometers of channel in a few hours. Towards a goal of automating the classification of bed habitat features, we investigate relationships between substrates and statistical descriptors of bed textures in side scan sonar echograms of alluvial deposits. We develop a method for automated segmentation of bed textures into between two to five grain-size classes. Second-order texture statistics are used in conjunction with a Gaussian Mixture Model to classify the heterogeneous bed into small homogeneous patches of sand, gravel, and boulders with an average accuracy of 80%, 49%, and 61%, respectively. Reach-averaged proportions of these sediment types were within 3% compared to similar maps derived from multibeam sonar.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Hamill, Daniel Buscombe, Joseph M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Diagnosing HIV and/or TB is not sufficient; linkage to care and treatment is conditional to reduce the burden of disease. This study aimed to determine factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based services in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected data from clients who utilized stand-alone (fixed site not attached to a health facility) and mobile HIV testing services in eight communities in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan district, between January 2008 and June 2012. Clients were included in the analysis if they were ≥12 years and had a known HIV status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to assess the association between determinants (sex, age, HIV testing service and co-infection status) and self-reported linkage to HIV care and/or TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Linkage to HIV care was 3 738/5 929 (63.1%). Linkage to HIV care was associated with the type of HIV testing service. Clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services had a significantly reduced odds of linking to HIV care (aOR 0.7 (CI 95%: 0.6–0.8), p&amp;lt;0.001. Linkage to TB treatment was 210/275 (76.4%). Linkage to TB treatment was not associated with sex and service type, but was associated with age. Clients in older age groups were less likely to link to TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years (all, p-value&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A large proportion of clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services did not link to care.

As technology becomes increasingly integrated with education, research on the relationships between students’ computing-related emotions and motivation following technological difficulties is critical to improving learning experiences. Following from Weiner’s (2010) attribution theory of achievement motivation, the present research examined relationships between causal attributions and emotions concerning academic computing difficulties in two studies. Study samples consisted of North American university students enrolled in both traditional and online universities (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 559) who responded to either hypothetical scenarios or experimental manipulations involving technological challenges experienced in academic settings. Findings from Study 1 showed stable and external attributions to be emotionally maladaptive (more helplessness, boredom, guilt), particularly in response to unexpected computing problems. Additionally, Study 2 found stable attributions for unexpected problems to predict more anxiety for traditional students, with both external and personally controllable attributions for minor problems proving emotionally beneficial for students in online degree programs (more hope, less anxiety). Overall, hypothesized negative effects of stable attributions were observed across both studies, with mixed results for personally controllable attributions and unanticipated emotional benefits of external attributions for academic computing problems warranting further study.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Maymon, Nathan C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50). LF/HF did not differ between groups. Levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were associated with several HRV parameters, as well as Time from diagnosis of T2DM&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;T2DM was associated with an overall decrease in the HRV of T2DM patients. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity were decreased, which can be explained by the deleterious effects of altered glucose metabolism on HRV, leading to cardiac autonomic neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Benichou, Bruno Pereira, Martial Mermillod, Igor Tauveron, Daniela Pfabigan, Salwan Maqdasy, Frédéric Dutheil&lt;/p&gt;

In Brazil, there is still the difficulty of building a mechanism that is not impaired by its large territorial extension and its poorly integrated sectoral policies. The Brazilian Wildlife Health Information System, SISS-Geo, is a platform for collaborative monitoring that intends to overcome the challenges in wildlife health. It aims integration and participation of various segments of society, encompassing: the registration of occurrences by citizen scientists; the reliable diagnosis of pathogens from the laboratory and expert networks; and computational and mathematical challenges in analytical and predictive systems, knowledge extraction, data integration and visualization, and geographic information systems. It has been successfully applied to support decision-making on recent wildlife health events, such as a Yellow Fever epizooty.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The well-being of wildlife health involves many challenges, such as monitoring the movement of pathogens; expanding health surveillance beyond humans; collecting data and extracting information to identify and predict risks; integrating specialists from different areas to handle data, species and distinct social and environmental contexts; and, the commitment to bringing relevant information to society. In Brazil, there is still the difficulty of building a mechanism that is not impaired by its large territorial extension and its poorly integrated sectoral policies.

&lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; represents one of the major diarrhea-inducing pathogens threatening public health, but its prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profile in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, China, remains unclear. We conducted comprehensive investigation of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance pattern in Xinjiang, identifying 458 &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates between 2008 to 2014. &lt;i&gt;Shigella flexneri&lt;/i&gt; was identified as predominant species, and several &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were isolated, including atypical serotypes 1c, 2c, and 4s. Dominant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were 2a, 1b, 2b, and Xv, different from those generally dominant in China. A hybrid serotype pattern was observed, which included the major Chinese serotypes (2a, Xv) and those predominant in Pakistan (1b, 2b). &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; was shown to have a lower frequency compared with that generally observed in China, but an increasing trend of infections associated with this pathogen was observed. Furthermore, a high frequency of drug resistance and different &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; antimicrobial resistance patterns were demonstrated as well, including very severe resistance phenotypes, such as multidrug resistance and resistance to frontline antibiotics. Seventy-five cephalosporin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates were frequently identified with the resistance determinants that can undergo horizontal transfer, such as &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TEM&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt;, and integrons, facilitating the development of cephalosporin resistance among &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; subtypes. Additionally, genetic analyses demonstrated that all 86 quinolone-resistant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates possess 3–4 mutation sites in quinolone resistance-determining regions, primarily contributing to their resistance to quinolone. However, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sonnei&lt;/i&gt; isolates were not shown to be quinolone resistant. Co-resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was detected in 17 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates, and these isolates were additionally multidrug resistant and carried β-lactamase genes and quinolone-resistance determinants. As is demonstrated in this study, dominant serotypes of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; were distributed in unique trend with dangerous drug resistance patterns. Novel strategies are urgently required to prevent the development of drug resistance among diarrhea-inducing pathogens.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hongbo Liu, Binghua Zhu, Shaofu Qiu, Yidan Xia, Beibei Liang, Chaojie Yang, Nian Dong, Yongrui Li, Ying Xiang, Shan Wang, Jing Xie, Muti Mahe, Yansong Sun, Hongbin Song&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is an emerging biomarker for risk stratification in cardiovascular disease. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this retrospectively observational study, we aimed to determine the role of GDF-15 and the risk of AKI in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The medical records of 1195 patients with AMI were reviewed. After exclusion criteria, a total of 751 eligible patients who underwent CAG or PCI were studied. Preoperative clinical parameters including GDF-15 levels were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors of AKI. Subsequently, to reduce a potential selection bias and to balance differences between the two groups, a propensity score-matched analysis was performed. We recorded the 30-day all-cause mortality of the total study population. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to identify the association between short term survival in AMI patients and GDF-15 level.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 751 enrolled patients, 106 patients (14.1%) developed AKI. Patients were divided into two groups: AKI group (n = 106) and non-AKI group (n = 645). GDF-15 levels were significantly higher in AKI group compared to non-AKI group (1328.2 ± 349.7 ng/L vs. 1113.0 ± 371.3 ng/L, P &amp;lt;0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed GDF-15 was an independent risk factor of AKI (per 1000 ng/L increase of GDF-15, OR: 3.740, 95% CI: 1.940–7.207, P &amp;lt; 0.001). According to GDF-15 tertiles, patients were divided into three groups. Patients in middle (OR 2.93, 95% CI: 1.46–5.89, P = 0.003) and highest GDF-15 tertile (OR 3.72, 95% CI: 1.87–7.39, P &amp;lt;0.001) had higher risk of AKI compared to patients in the lowest GDF-15 tertile. The propensity score-matched group set comprised of 212 patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that GDF-15 is still an independent risk factor for AKI after matching (per 1000 ng/L increase of GDF-15, OR: 2.395, 95% CI: 1.020–5.626, P = 0.045). Based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the risk of 30-day all-cause mortality increased in higher GDF-15 tertiles log rank chi-square: 29.895, P &amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This suggests that preoperative plasma GDF-15 is an independent risk factor of AKI in AMI patients underwent CAG or PCI. GDF-15 and AKI are associated with poor short term survival of AMI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ling Sun, Xuejun Zhou, Jianguang Jiang, Xuan Zang, Xin Chen, Haiyan Li, Haitao Cao, Qingjie Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Chronic constipation is a functional gastrointestinal disease that is detrimental to the quality of patient life. &lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; L. (CO) and &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; M. (FV) are commonly used as medicinal foods in many countries. We aimed to examine the laxative effect and their underlying mechanism of CO and FV mixture on loperamide (lop)-induced constipated rats. To determine the laxative effects of these compounds, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: the control, lop-induced constipated (2mg/kg), and three doses (100, 300, and 500mg/kg) of CO and FV mixture-, and Bisacodyl (bis, 3.3mg/kg)-treated groups. The mixture of CO and FV and bis were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. For induction of constipation, the lop were treated with a dose of 2 mg/kg twice a day on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week after treatments of CO and FV extracts and bis. The results were revealed that the CO and FV mixture has the laxative effects more than those in CO and FV-alone treatments on constipated rats by determining the stool parameters, including stool number and weight. Indeed, stool parameters, such as, stool number, weight, and water contents and colonic peristalsis from the intestinal transit length and ratio were dramatically improved by CO and FV mixture treatment. Histological study also revealed that CO and FV mixture enhanced the thicknesses of mucosa and muscular layers of the colon in constipated rats. For their underlying mechanism, the mRNAs and proteins expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) M2 and M3 and their downstream signaling were preserved by CO and FV mixture treatment in constipated rats. Therefore, this study suggests that treatment with CO and FV mixture has beneficial effects against constipation. We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Hee Jang, Dong Kwon Yang&lt;/p&gt;

We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</content></content></item><item><published>1523383509000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Signaling current issue</title></origin><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/525/eaaq0825?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><title>Architecture of the complete oxygen-sensing FixL-FixJ two-component signal transduction system</title><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/525/eaaq0825?rss=1</originId><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_162b0dce2b7:1f0ff8b:923c4a60</id><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/525/eaaq0825.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/525/eaaq0825?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>99e80a92</fingerprint><author><name>Wright, G.

Over expression of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induces apoptosis and reduces neointima formation occurring after saphenous vein interposition grafting or coronary stenting. In studies to address the mechanism of TIMP-3-driven apoptosis in human VSMCs we find that TIMP-3 increased activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis was inhibited by expression of Cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) and dominant negative FAS-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD). TIMP-3 induced apoptosis did not cause mitochondrial depolarisation, increase activation of caspase-9 and was not inhibited by over-expression of B-cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), indicating a mitochondrial independent/type-I death receptor pathway. TIMP-3 increased levels of the First Apoptosis Signal receptor (FAS) and depletion of FAS with shRNA showed TIMP-3-induced apoptosis was FAS dependent. TIMP-3 induced formation of the Death-Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC), as detected by immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence. Cellular-FADD-like IL-1 converting enzyme-Like Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) localised with FAS at the cell periphery in the absence of TIMP-3 and this localisation was lost on TIMP-3 expression with c-FLIP adopting a perinuclear localisation. Although TIMP-3 inhibited FAS shedding, this did not increase total surface levels of FAS but instead increased FAS levels within localised regions at the cell surface. A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is inhibited by TIMP-3 and depletion of ADAM17 with shRNA significantly decreased FAS shedding. However ADAM17 depletion did not induce apoptosis or replicate the effects of TIMP-3 by increasing localised clustering of cell surface FAS. ADAM17-depleted cells could activate caspase-3 when expressing levels of TIMP-3 that were otherwise sub-apoptotic, suggesting a partial role for ADAM17 mediated ectodomain shedding in TIMP-3 mediated apoptosis. We conclude that TIMP-3 induced apoptosis in VSMCs is highly dependent on FAS and is associated with changes in FAS and c-FLIP localisation, but is not solely dependent on shedding of the FAS ectodomain.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by William R.

TIMP-3 induced formation of the Death-Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC), as detected by immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence. Cellular-FADD-like IL-1 converting enzyme-Like Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) localised with FAS at the cell periphery in the absence of TIMP-3 and this localisation was lost on TIMP-3 expression with c-FLIP adopting a perinuclear localisation. Although TIMP-3 inhibited FAS shedding, this did not increase total surface levels of FAS but instead increased FAS levels within localised regions at the cell surface. A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is inhibited by TIMP-3 and depletion of ADAM17 with shRNA significantly decreased FAS shedding. However ADAM17 depletion did not induce apoptosis or replicate the effects of TIMP-3 by increasing localised clustering of cell surface FAS. ADAM17-depleted cells could activate caspase-3 when expressing levels of TIMP-3 that were otherwise sub-apoptotic, suggesting a partial role for ADAM17 mediated ectodomain shedding in TIMP-3 mediated apoptosis. We conclude that TIMP-3 induced apoptosis in VSMCs is highly dependent on FAS and is associated with changes in FAS and c-FLIP localisation, but is not solely dependent on shedding of the FAS ectodomain.</content></content></item><item><published>1521135592000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><title>Chromosome dynamics and cellular clocks</title><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d2512b:9f3b30f2</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1227-p?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/1227.16.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1227-p?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>976c7e6</fingerprint><author><name>Ray, L.

Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator of ecosystem functioning but how ecosystem WUE responds to climate change including precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition increases is still unknown. To investigate such responses, an experiment with a randomized block design with water (spring snowfall or summer water addition) and nitrogen addition was conducted in a temperate steppe of northern China. We investigated net ecosystem CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (NEP), gross ecosystem production (GEP) and evapotranspiration (ET) to calculate ecosystem WUE (WUEnep = NEP/ET or WUEgep = GEP/ET) under spring snow and summer water addition with or without N addition from 2011 to 2013. The results showed that spring snow addition only had significant effect on ecosystem WUE in 2013 and summer water addition showed positive effect on ecosystem WUE in 2011 and 2013, as their effects on NEP and GEP is stronger than ET. N addition increased ecosystem WUE in 2012 and 2013 both in spring snow addition and summer water addition for its increasing effects on NEP and GEP but no effect on ET. Summer water addition had less but N addition had greater increasing effects on ecosystem WUE as natural precipitation increase indicating that natural precipitation regulates ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition. Moreover, WUE was tightly related with atmospheric vapor-pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), precipitation and soil moisture indicating the regulation of climate drivers on ecosystem WUE. In addition, it also was affected by aboveground net primary production (ANPP). The study suggests that ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition is determined by the change in carbon process rather than that in water process, which are regulated by climate change in the temperate steppe of northern China.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaolin Zhang, Penghui Zhai, Jianhui Huang, Xiang Zhao, Kuanhu Dong&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Data on implications of a high positive titer of serum anti-&lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; antibody on gastric cancer (GC) is limited. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of GC with a high serum anti-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; IgG (Hp-IgG) titer, and its association with diffuse-type GC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical and histological characteristics of 917 non-cardia GC patients who underwent gastrectomy. &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection was determined serologically by measuring Hp-IgG titer with immunoassay. Seropositive patients were divided into three groups (low-positive, mid-positive, and high-positive) according to the Hp-IgG titer value. Tumors were classified according to the Lauren criteria as diffuse or intestinal types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median age of the patients was 59.0 years, and 33.8% were female. The patents were grouped as follows: seronegative, 188 (20.5%); low-positive, 288 (31.4%); mid-positive, 290 (31.6%); and high-positive 151 (16.5%). The high-positive group was significantly younger (median age, 55.0 years), with a higher proportion of female (45.0%) and non-smokers (58.9%). The proportion of diffuse-type GC increased in the order low-, mid-, and high-positive groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, the factors associated with diffuse-type GC were younger age, female sex, non-smokers, and a high-positive Hp-IgG titer. Younger age, female sex, and non-smokers remained significant on multivariate analysis whereas the high-positive Hp-IgG titer showed only a tendency toward the association (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.078).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Non-cardia GC patients with a high Hp-IgG titer have distinct clinicopathologic characteristics. A high-positive Hp-IgG titer should be interpreted together with patients’ age, sex, and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eun Jeong Gong, Ji Young Lee, Suh Eun Bae, Young Soo Park, Kee Don Choi, Ho June Song, Gin Hyug Lee, Hwoon-Yong Jung, Woo Jin Jeong, Gab Jin Cheon, Jeong Hwan Yook, Byung Sik Kim&lt;/p&gt;

The detection of recurrent somatic chromosomal rearrangements is standard of care for most leukemia types. Even though karyotype analysis—a low-resolution genome-wide chromosome analysis—is still the gold standard, it often needs to be complemented with other methods to increase resolution. To evaluate the feasibility and applicability of mate pair whole genome sequencing (MP-WGS) to detect structural chromosomal rearrangements in the diagnostic setting, we sequenced ten bone marrow samples from leukemia patients with recurrent rearrangements. Samples were selected based on cytogenetic and FISH results at leukemia diagnosis to include common rearrangements of prognostic relevance. Using MP-WGS and in-house bioinformatic analysis all sought rearrangements were successfully detected. In addition, unexpected complexity or additional, previously undetected rearrangements was unraveled in three samples. Finally, the MP-WGS analysis pinpointed the location of chromosome junctions at high resolution and we were able to identify the exact exons involved in the resulting fusion genes in all samples and the specific junction at the nucleotide level in half of the samples. The results show that our approach combines the screening character from karyotype analysis with the specificity and resolution of cytogenetic and molecular methods. As a result of the straightforward analysis and high-resolution detection of clinically relevant rearrangements, we conclude that MP-WGS is a feasible method for routine leukemia diagnostics of structural chromosomal rearrangements.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anh Nhi Tran, Fulya Taylan, Vasilios Zachariadis, Ingegerd Ivanov Öfverholm, Anna Lindstrand, Francesco Vezzi, Britta Lötstedt, Magnus Nordenskjöld, Ann Nordgren, Daniel Nilsson, Gisela Barbany&lt;/p&gt;
