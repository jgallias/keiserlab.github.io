Around 70% of circulating alpha-2-antiplasmin (α2AP), the main natural plasmin inhibitor, is N-terminally cleaved between residues Pro12 and Asn13 by antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme. This converts native Met-α2AP into the more potent fibrinolysis inhibitor Asn-α2AP. The Arg6Trp (R6W) polymorphism affects the N-terminal cleavage rate of Met-α2AP in a purified system, with ~8-fold faster conversion of Met(R6)-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP. To date, assays to determine N-terminally intact Met-α2AP in plasma have been limited to an ELISA that only measures Met(R6)-α2AP. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and all α2AP forms (total-α2AP) in order to develop specific Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP ELISAs. Recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and Asn-α2AP were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. Using hybridoma technology, a panel of 25 mAbs was generated against a mixture of recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP. All mAbs were evaluated for their specific reactivity using the three recombinant α2APs in one-site non-competitive ELISAs. Three mAbs were selected to develop sandwich-type ELISAs. MA-AP37E2 and MA-AP34C4 were selected for their specific reactivity against Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, and used for coating. MA-AP15D7 was selected for its reactivity against total-α2AP and used for detection. With the novel ELISAs we determined Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP levels in plasma samples and we showed that Met(R6)-α2AP was converted faster into Asn-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP in a plasma milieu. In conclusion, we developed two specific ELISAs for Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, in plasma. This will enable us to determine N-terminal heterogeneity of α2AP in plasma samples.</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Generation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminus of alpha-2-antiplasmin</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196911</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiraazkhan Abdul, Miet Peeters, Els Brouwers, Joyce J.

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Potential travel cost saving in urban public-transport networks using smartphone guidance</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197181</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cuiying Song, Wei Guan, Jihui Ma&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the considerable burden of helminth infections in developing countries and increasing international travel, little is known about the risks of infection for travelers.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We studied the attack and incidence rate of serology confirmed strongyloidiasis, filariasis, and toxocariasis among long-term travelers and associated factors. A second objective was to evaluate eosinophilia as a positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) for a recent helminth infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From 2008 to 2011, clients of the Public Health Service travel clinic planning travel to (sub)tropical countries for 12–52 weeks were invited to participate in a prospective study. Participants kept a weekly diary, recording itinerary, symptoms, and physician visits during travel and completed a post-travel questionnaire. Pre- and post-travel blood samples were serologically tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; species, &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides stercoralis&lt;/i&gt;, filarial species, and &lt;i&gt;Toxacara&lt;/i&gt; species and were used for a blood cell count. Factors associated with recent infection were analyzed using Poisson regression. Differences among groups of travelers were studied using chi square tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For the 604 participants, median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23–29), 36% were male, median travel duration was 20 weeks (IQR: 15–25), and travel purpose was predominantly tourism (62%). Destinations were Asia (45%), Africa (18%), and the Americas (37%).Evidence of previous infection was found in 13/604 participants: antibodies against &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; spp. in 5 (0.8%), against &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;stercoralis&lt;/i&gt; in 3 (0.5%), against filarial species in 4 (0.7%), and against &lt;i&gt;Toxocara&lt;/i&gt; spp. in 1 (0.2%). Ten recent infections were found in 9 participants (3, 1, 6, 0 cases, in the above order), making the attack rates 0.61, 0.17, 1.1 and 0, and the incidence rates per 1000 person-months 1.5, 0.34, 2.6 and 0.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the considerable burden of helminth infections in developing countries and increasing international travel, little is known about the risks of infection for travelers.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We studied the attack and incidence rate of serology confirmed strongyloidiasis, filariasis, and toxocariasis among long-term travelers and associated factors. A second objective was to evaluate eosinophilia as a positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) for a recent helminth infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From 2008 to 2011, clients of the Public Health Service travel clinic planning travel to (sub)tropical countries for 12–52 weeks were invited to participate in a prospective study. Participants kept a weekly diary, recording itinerary, symptoms, and physician visits during travel and completed a post-travel questionnaire. Pre- and post-travel blood samples were serologically tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; species, &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides stercoralis&lt;/i&gt;, filarial species, and &lt;i&gt;Toxacara&lt;/i&gt; species and were used for a blood cell count. Factors associated with recent infection were analyzed using Poisson regression. Differences among groups of travelers were studied using chi square tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For the 604 participants, median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23–29), 36% were male, median travel duration was 20 weeks (IQR: 15–25), and travel purpose was predominantly tourism (62%). Destinations were Asia (45%), Africa (18%), and the Americas (37%).Evidence of previous infection was found in 13/604 participants: antibodies against &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; spp. in 5 (0.8%), against &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;stercoralis&lt;/i&gt; in 3 (0.5%), against filarial species in 4 (0.7%), and against &lt;i&gt;Toxocara&lt;/i&gt; spp. in 1 (0.2%). Ten recent infections were found in 9 participants (3, 1, 6, 0 cases, in the above order), making the attack rates 0.61, 0.17, 1.1 and 0, and the incidence rates per 1000 person-months 1.5, 0.34, 2.6 and 0. The overall PPV and NPV of eosinophila for recent infection were 0 and 98%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The risk of the helminth infections under study in this cohort of long-term travelers was low. Routine screening for eosinophilia appeared not to be of diagnostic value.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163ad15e82f:1385da7:c2c34441</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006168</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006168</link><author><name>Han-Lin Hsieh</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Han-Lin Hsieh, Maryam M.

Closed-loop neurotechnologies often need to adaptively learn an encoding model that relates the neural activity to the brain state, and is used for brain state decoding. The speed and accuracy of adaptive learning algorithms are critically affected by the learning rate, which dictates how fast model parameters are updated based on new observations. Despite the importance of the learning rate, currently an analytical approach for its selection is largely lacking and existing signal processing methods vastly tune it empirically or heuristically. Here, we develop a novel analytical calibration algorithm for optimal selection of the learning rate in adaptive Bayesian filters. We formulate the problem through a fundamental trade-off that learning rate introduces between the steady-state error and the convergence time of the estimated model parameters. We derive explicit functions that predict the effect of learning rate on error and convergence time. Using these functions, our calibration algorithm can keep the steady-state parameter error covariance smaller than a desired upper-bound while minimizing the convergence time, or keep the convergence time faster than a desired value while minimizing the error. We derive the algorithm both for discrete-valued spikes modeled as point processes nonlinearly dependent on the brain state, and for continuous-valued neural recordings modeled as Gaussian processes linearly dependent on the brain state. Using extensive closed-loop simulations, we show that the analytical solution of the calibration algorithm accurately predicts the effect of learning rate on parameter error and convergence time. Moreover, the calibration algorithm allows for fast and accurate learning of the encoding model and for fast convergence of decoding to accurate performance. Finally, larger learning rates result in inaccurate encoding models and decoders, and smaller learning rates delay their convergence. The calibration algorithm provides a novel analytical approach to predictably achieve a desired level of error and convergence time in adaptive learning, with application to closed-loop neurotechnologies and other signal processing domains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AXBHSencE5U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527617284143</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AXBHSencE5U/article</href></item></alternate><published>1527627600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Optimizing the learning rate for adaptive estimation of neural encoding models</title><recrawled>1527626526848</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Han-Lin Hsieh, Maryam M.

One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><published>1526677200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Acute intermittent hypoxia and rehabilitative training following cervical spinal injury alters neuronal hypoxia- and plasticity-associated protein expression</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atiq Hassan, Breanna M.

Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</description><fingerprint>fb4f7ece</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25111-6/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25111_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>434</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1631b0013ab:23a7599:11c251fd</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25111-6</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25111-6</link><author><name>Pil-Sung Yang</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Variations of Prevalence and Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation and Oral Anticoagulation Rate According to Different Analysis Approaches&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variations of Prevalence and Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation and Oral Anticoagulation Rate According to Different Analysis Approaches, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25111-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25111-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Variations of Prevalence and Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation and Oral Anticoagulation Rate According to Different Analysis Approaches&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/P2pWJG3MS9o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525166379947</crawled><published>1525158000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Variations of Prevalence and Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation and Oral Anticoagulation Rate According to Different Analysis Approaches</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/P2pWJG3MS9o/s41598-018-25111-6</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Variations of Prevalence and Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation and Oral Anticoagulation Rate According to Different Analysis Approaches&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variations of Prevalence and Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation and Oral Anticoagulation Rate According to Different Analysis Approaches, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25111-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25111-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Variations of Prevalence and Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation and Oral Anticoagulation Rate According to Different Analysis Approaches&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/P2pWJG3MS9o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>b4c8a002</fingerprint><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25111-6</href></item></canonical></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166/20180430/images/medium/mp-2017-01166a_0008.gif</url><height>194</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_163186e13b7:723d2:a96d255</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166</link><author><name>Takashi Nakamura, Koharu Yamada, Yuki Fujiwara, Yusuke Sato, Hideyoshi Harashima</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166/20180430/images/medium/mp-2017-01166a_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01166&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main products of indigestible carbohydrates that are fermented by microbiota in the hindgut. This study was designed to investigate the effects of oral SCFAs administration on the lipid metabolism of weaned pigs. A total of 21 barrows were randomly allocated into three groups, including control group (orally infused with 200 mL physiological saline per day), low dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 20.04 mM, propionic acid 7.71 mM and butyric acid 4.89 mM per day), and high dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 40.08 mM, propionic acid 15.42 mM and butyric acid 9.78 mM per day). The results showed that the average daily feed intake of SCFAs groups were lower than that of control group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Oral administration of SCFAs decreased the concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and insulin (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased the leptin concentration in serum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). The total fat, as well as TC and TG levels in liver, was decreased by oral SCFAs administration (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, SCFAs down-regulated the mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and enhanced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α) in liver (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). SCFAs also decreased FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor σ mRNA expressions in longissimus dorsi (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). And in abdominal fat, SCFAs reduced FAS and ACC mRNA expressions (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased CPT-1α mRNA expression (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). These results suggested that oral administration of SCFAs could attenuate fat deposition in weaned pigs via reducing lipogenesis and enhancing lipolysis of different tissues.</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Oral administration of short chain fatty acids could attenuate fat deposition of pigs</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196867</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by A.

WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence. This peptide exhibits micromolar affinity towards WHSC1 in biochemical and biophysical assays. Furthermore, a crystal structure was solved with the peptide in complex with SAM and the SET domain of WHSC1L1. This inhibitor is an important first step in creating potent, selective WHSC1 tool compounds for the purposes of understanding the complex biology in relation to human disease.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><published>1525899600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Identification of a peptide inhibitor for the histone methyltransferase WHSC1</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197082</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael J.

&lt;i&gt;Arachis hypogaea&lt;/i&gt; L. geocarpy is a unique feature different from other legume plants. Flowering and fertilization occur above ground, while the following processes of pod formation and development proceed in the soil. The zygote divides only few times to develop into pre-embryo and then further embryo developmental process stops when the gynoecium is exposed to light condition or normal day/night period. In this study, eight phytochrome genes were identified in two wild peanuts (four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis ipaensis&lt;/i&gt;). Using RACE and homologous cloning, the full CDS of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AhphyE&lt;/i&gt; were acquired in cultivated peanut. Protein structure analysis showed that the conservative coding domains of phytochromes from a number of other plant species were found in these proteins. The C-terminal of AhphyA, AhphyA-like and AhphyB could interact with phytochrome-interacting factor 3 in vitro. The expression patterns of these genes in various tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR, and significant differences were observed. Interestingly, the expression levels of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt; changed significantly during gynophore growth and early pod development. Furthermore, protein accumulation patterns of AhphyA and AhphyB in gynophore were different during early pod development stages in that AhphyA and AhphyB proteins were not detected in S1 and S2 gynophores, while significant accumulation of AhphyA and AhphyB were detected in S3 gynophore.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether stopping the effective antibiotic treatment following clinical improvement at Day 7 (Truncated treatment) would be non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 (Continued treatment) in patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) requiring hospitalization treated with non-fluoroquinolone (non-FQ) antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized adult men and non-pregnant women with culture-confirmed APN were eligible for participation after they had clinically improved following empirical or culture-guided treatment with intravenous non-FQ antibiotic(s). We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients—27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether stopping the effective antibiotic treatment following clinical improvement at Day 7 (Truncated treatment) would be non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 (Continued treatment) in patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) requiring hospitalization treated with non-fluoroquinolone (non-FQ) antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized adult men and non-pregnant women with culture-confirmed APN were eligible for participation after they had clinically improved following empirical or culture-guided treatment with intravenous non-FQ antibiotic(s). We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients—27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated. Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was −3.7% (−15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.0). Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7–10] vs. 14 [14–15] days; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>f16c7cec</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197302</link></item><item><engagement>9</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/20/5041/F1.medium.gif</url><height>440</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>367</width></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16364ca7c57:39f3a22:93d646dc</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5041.short?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>8323804d</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Habitat degradation and coral reef fish behavior Degraded coral reef at Lizard Island.

The widespread use of social media has created a valuable but underused source of data for the environmental sciences. We demonstrate the potential for images posted to the website Twitter to capture variability in vegetation phenology across United States National Parks. We process a subset of images posted to Twitter within eight U.S. National Parks, with the aim of understanding the amount of green vegetation in each image. Analysis of the relative greenness of the images show statistically significant seasonal cycles across most National Parks at the 95% confidence level, consistent with springtime green-up and fall senescence. Additionally, these social media-derived greenness indices correlate with monthly mean satellite NDVI (r = 0.62), reinforcing the potential value these data could provide in constraining models and observing regions with limited high quality scientific monitoring.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Observing vegetation phenology through social media</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197325</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sam J.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Glucagon like-peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists diminish appetite and may contribute to the weight loss in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to determine, for the first time, the expression of GLP-1R by colon nerve fibres in patients with IBD, and functional effects of its agonists in cultured rat and human sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;GLP-1R and other nerve markers were studied by immunohistochemistry in colon biopsies from patients with IBD (n = 16) and controls (n = 8), human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissue, and in GLP-1R transfected HEK293 cells. The morphological effects of incretin hormones oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and glucagon were studied on neurite extension in cultured DRG neurons, and their functional effects on capsaicin and ATP signalling, using calcium imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significantly increased numbers of colonic mucosal nerve fibres were observed in IBD biopsies expressing GLP-1R (p = 0.0013), the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 (p = 0.0008), and sensory neuropeptide CGRP (p = 0.0014). An increase of GLP-1R positive nerve fibres in IBD colon was confirmed with a different antibody to GLP-1R (p = 0.016). GLP-1R immunostaining was intensely positive in small and medium-sized neurons in human DRG, and in human and rat DRG cultured neurons. Co-localization of GLP-1R expression with neuronal markers in colon and DRG confirmed the neural expression of GLP-1R, and antibody specificity was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with the GLP-1R. Treatment with oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and GLP-1 increased neurite length in cultured neurons compared with controls, but did not stimulate calcium influx directly, or affect capsaicin responses. However, exendin-4 significantly enhanced ATP responses in human DRG neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results show that increased GLP-1R innervation in IBD bowel could mediate enhanced visceral afferent signalling, and provide a peripheral target for therapeutic intervention. The differential effect of GLP-1R agonists on capsaicin and ATP responses in neurons suggest they may not affect pain mechanisms mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1, but may enhance the effects of purinergic agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><published>1527627600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) expression by nerve fibres in inflammatory bowel disease and functional effects in cultured neurons</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198024</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Uma Anand, Yiangos Yiangou, Ayesha Akbar, Tom Quick, Anthony MacQuillan, Mike Fox, Marco Sinisi, Yuri E.

The morphological effects of incretin hormones oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and glucagon were studied on neurite extension in cultured DRG neurons, and their functional effects on capsaicin and ATP signalling, using calcium imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significantly increased numbers of colonic mucosal nerve fibres were observed in IBD biopsies expressing GLP-1R (p = 0.0013), the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 (p = 0.0008), and sensory neuropeptide CGRP (p = 0.0014). An increase of GLP-1R positive nerve fibres in IBD colon was confirmed with a different antibody to GLP-1R (p = 0.016). GLP-1R immunostaining was intensely positive in small and medium-sized neurons in human DRG, and in human and rat DRG cultured neurons. Co-localization of GLP-1R expression with neuronal markers in colon and DRG confirmed the neural expression of GLP-1R, and antibody specificity was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with the GLP-1R. Treatment with oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and GLP-1 increased neurite length in cultured neurons compared with controls, but did not stimulate calcium influx directly, or affect capsaicin responses. However, exendin-4 significantly enhanced ATP responses in human DRG neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results show that increased GLP-1R innervation in IBD bowel could mediate enhanced visceral afferent signalling, and provide a peripheral target for therapeutic intervention. The differential effect of GLP-1R agonists on capsaicin and ATP responses in neurons suggest they may not affect pain mechanisms mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1, but may enhance the effects of purinergic agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>fcf3b63d</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198024</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a197:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196895</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196895</canonicalUrl><author><name>Naoto Fujita</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naoto Fujita, Saki Aono, Kohei Karasaki, Fumi Sera, Tomoyuki Kurose, Hidemi Fujino, Susumu Urakawa&lt;/p&gt;
Although exercise is effective in improving obesity and hyperinsulinemia, the exact influence of exercise on the capillary density of skeletal muscles remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low-intensity exercise training on metabolism in obesity with hyperinsulinemia, focusing specifically on the capillary density within the skeletal muscle. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats were used as animal models of obesity with hyperinsulinemia, whereas Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats served as controls (no obesity, no hyperinsulinemia). The animals were randomly assigned to either non-exercise or exercise groups (treadmill running for 60 min/day, for 4 weeks). The exercise groups were further divided into subgroups according to training mode: single bout (60 min, daily) vs. multiple bout (three bouts of 20 min, daily). Fasting insulin levels were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats. Among OLETF rats, there were no significant differences in fasting glucose levels between the exercise and the non-exercise groups, but the fasting insulin levels were significantly lower in the exercise group. Body weight and triacylglycerol levels in the liver were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats; however, among OLETF rats, these levels were significantly lower in the exercise than in the non-exercise group. The capillary-to-fiber ratio of the soleus muscle was significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats; however, among OLETF rats, the ratio was lower in the exercise group than in the non-exercise group. No significant differences in any of the studied parameters were noted between the single-bout and multiple-bout exercise training modes among either OLETF or LETO rats. These results suggest that low-intensity exercise training improves insulin sensitivity and fatty liver. Additionally, the fact that attenuation of excessive capillarization in the skeletal muscle of OLETF rats was accompanied by improvement in increased body weight.</content></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><published>1525294800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Changes in lipid metabolism and capillary density of the skeletal muscle following low-intensity exercise training in a rat model of obesity with hyperinsulinemia</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196895</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naoto Fujita, Saki Aono, Kohei Karasaki, Fumi Sera, Tomoyuki Kurose, Hidemi Fujino, Susumu Urakawa&lt;/p&gt;

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Pathological response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) represents a commonly used predictor of survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the need to identify markers that predict response to NAC is constantly increasing. Aim of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of PET imaging with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FLT for the discrimination of TNBC responders to Paclitaxel (PTX) therapy compared to the response assessed by an adapted Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria based on tumor volume (Tumor Volume Response).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Nu/nu mice bearing TNBC lesions of different size were evaluated with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FLT PET before and after PTX treatment. SUV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTV) and Total Lesion Glycolysis (TLG) and Proliferation (TLP) were assessed using a graph-based random walk algorithm.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found that in our TNBC model the variation of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FLT SUV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; similarly defined tumor response to therapy and that SUV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; variation represented the most accurate parameter. Response evaluation using Tumor Volume Response (TVR) showed that the effectiveness of NAC with PTX was completely independent from lesions size at baseline.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study provided interesting results in terms of sensitivity and specificity of PET in TNBC, revealing the similar performances of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FLT in the identification of responders to Paclitaxel.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><published>1527109200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>[&amp;lt;sup&gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&amp;lt;sup&gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&gt;F]FLT PET for the evaluation of response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in a model of triple negative breast cancer</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197754</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Isabella Raccagni, Sara Belloli, Silvia Valtorta, Alessandro Stefano, Luca Presotto, Claudio Pascali, Anna Bogni, Monica Tortoreto, Nadia Zaffaroni, Maria Grazia Daidone, Giorgio Russo, Emilio Bombardieri, Rosa Maria Moresco&lt;/p&gt;

An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. Methods: We designed mathematical models and fit them to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We used the model to predict the level of immune protection and morbidity for different inoculum doses and to explore what an optimal inoculum dose might be. Results: We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. We find that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity depends on the pathogen and both protection and morbidity do not always increase with increasing inoculum dose. An intermediate inoculum dose can provide the best balance between immune protection and morbidity, though this depends on the specific weighting of protection and morbidity.

The insect-transmitted protozoan parasite &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; experiences changes in nutrient availability and rate of flux through different metabolic pathways across its life cycle. The species encompasses much genetic diversity of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes among isolated strains. The genetic or expression variation of both genomes are likely to impact metabolic responses to environmental stimuli, and even steady state metabolic function, among strains. To begin formal characterization these differences, we compared aspects of metabolism between genetically similar strains CL Brener and Tulahuen with less similar Esmeraldo and Sylvio X10 strains in a culture environment. Epimastigotes of all strains took up glucose at similar rates. However, the degree of medium acidification that could be observed when glucose was absent from the medium varied by strain, indicating potential differences in excreted metabolic byproducts. Our main focus was differences related to electron transport chain function.

The insect-transmitted protozoan parasite &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; experiences changes in nutrient availability and rate of flux through different metabolic pathways across its life cycle. The species encompasses much genetic diversity of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes among isolated strains. The genetic or expression variation of both genomes are likely to impact metabolic responses to environmental stimuli, and even steady state metabolic function, among strains. To begin formal characterization these differences, we compared aspects of metabolism between genetically similar strains CL Brener and Tulahuen with less similar Esmeraldo and Sylvio X10 strains in a culture environment. Epimastigotes of all strains took up glucose at similar rates. However, the degree of medium acidification that could be observed when glucose was absent from the medium varied by strain, indicating potential differences in excreted metabolic byproducts. Our main focus was differences related to electron transport chain function. We observed differences in ATP-coupled respiration and maximal respiratory capacity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial morphology between strains, despite the fact that abundances of two nuclear-encoded proteins of the electron transport chain are similar between strains. RNA sequencing reveals strain-specific differences in abundances of mRNAs encoding proteins of the respiratory chain but also other metabolic processes. From these differences in metabolism and mitochondrial phenotypes we have generated tentative models for the differential metabolic fluxes or differences in gene expression that may underlie these results.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636a1a35e2:4db35:d63e3ae2</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006127</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006127</link><author><name>Damiano Pasetto</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C.

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526493492706</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rXysUXWSU_g/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526504400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Near real-time forecasting for cholera decision making in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew</title><recrawled>1526503332228</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C.

To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and Large White sows (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In addition, the serological concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were not significantly different between the two breeds at the 3rd week postpartum. However, these indicators were significantly different at the 5th week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.000, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, respectively). The SIgA concentrations in saliva were significantly different between breeds at the 3rd week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In conclusion, both breeds of sows maybe in a state of stress after the 4th week postpartum. However, the Damin sows may be better than the Large White sows in terms of adapting to this farrowing environment.</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><published>1526331600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Behavior and physiology of two different sow breeds in a farrowing environment during late 35-day lactation</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197152</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Honggui Liu, Ran Yi, Chao Wang, Peng Zhao, Mingyue Zhang, Shiwen Xu, Jun Bao&lt;/p&gt;

Our refined model shows an excellent agreement with the experiment for self‐diffusion coefficient and thermodynamic quantities as well as providing a qualitative description of the microscopic structure of liquid ACN. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26269-9/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26269_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>509</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1638c4abd72:743cf22:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26269-9</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26269-9</link><author><name>Sharadha Dayalan Naidu</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C151 in KEAP1 is the main cysteine sensor for the cyanoenone class of NRF2 activators, irrespective of molecular size or shape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C151 in KEAP1 is the main cysteine sensor for the cyanoenone class of NRF2 activators, irrespective of molecular size or shape, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26269-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26269-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;C151 in KEAP1 is the main cysteine sensor for the cyanoenone class of NRF2 activators, irrespective of molecular size or shape&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uT0kAfUxf_A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527067098482</crawled><published>1527058800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>C151 in KEAP1 is the main cysteine sensor for the cyanoenone class of NRF2 activators, irrespective of molecular size or shape</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/uT0kAfUxf_A/s41598-018-26269-9</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C151 in KEAP1 is the main cysteine sensor for the cyanoenone class of NRF2 activators, irrespective of molecular size or shape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C151 in KEAP1 is the main cysteine sensor for the cyanoenone class of NRF2 activators, irrespective of molecular size or shape, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26269-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26269-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;C151 in KEAP1 is the main cysteine sensor for the cyanoenone class of NRF2 activators, irrespective of molecular size or shape&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uT0kAfUxf_A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>1a55cd33</fingerprint><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26269-9</href></item></canonical></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914d:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</canonicalUrl><author><name>Lucia Bizovska</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;
Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Local dynamic stability during gait for predicting falls in elderly people: A one-year prospective study</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The typical degeneration of the vertebral endplate shown in MRI imaging is Modic change. The aim of this study was to observe the distribution of the Modic changes of vertebral endplate in degenerative thoracolumbar/lumbar kyphosis (DTK/LK) patients and analyse the correlation between spinal-pelvic parameters and Modic changes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The imaging data of 58 patients diagnosed with DTK/LK (coronal Cobb angle&amp;lt;10°with sagittal imbalance) in our hospital from March 2016 to May 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Observe the prevalence, type and distribution characteristics of Modic changes occurred at the vertebral endplate from T10 to S1;analyse the correlation between Modic changes and disc degeneration, the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT) and pelvic incidence (PI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 928 intervertebral endplates from 58 patients, Modic changes occurred at 90 endplates (9.7%) of 30 patients (51.7%). 5 endplates (0.5%) of 3 patients (5.2%) were classified as type I, 68 endplates (7.3%) of 25 patients (43.1%) as type II, 17 endplates (1.8%) of 9 patients (15.5%) as type III.

Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eh0FCzbR2R4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526665788268</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Eh0FCzbR2R4/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526677200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>On the role of sparseness in the evolution of modularity in gene regulatory networks</title><recrawled>1526676128418</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Espinosa-Soto&lt;/p&gt;

The identification of germplasm resources is an important aspect of sugarcane breeding. The aim of this study was to introduce a new method for identifying &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny. First, we cloned and sequenced nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrDNA-ITS) sequences from 20 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms. Analysis of these nrDNA-ITS sequences showed a stable mutation at base 89. Primers (FO13, RO13, FI16, and RI16) were then designed for tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR based on mutations at base 89 of the nrDNA-ITS sequence. An additional 71 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms were identified using this tetra-primer ARMS PCR method, which confirmed that the method using the described primers successfully identified &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and progeny. These results may help improve the efficiency of modern molecular breeding of sugarcane and lay a foundation for identification of sugarcane germplasms and the relationships among them.</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><published>1526504400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A new method based on SNP of nrDNA-ITS to identify &amp;lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&amp;lt;/i&gt; and its progeny in the genus &amp;lt;i&gt;Saccharum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197458</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shan Yang, Xueting Li, Fei Huang, Yongji Huang, Xinlong Liu, Jiayun Wu, Qinnan Wang, Zuhu Deng, Rukai Chen, Muqing Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

We developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism’s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HxEjp5eCvBA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525887570014</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/HxEjp5eCvBA/article</href></item></alternate><published>1525899600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The AmP project: Comparing species on the basis of dynamic energy budget parameters</title><recrawled>1525887730160</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gonçalo M.

Our data prompt a model in which Bqt4-rich nuclear subdomains are ‘safe zones’ in which collisions between transcription and replication are averted and heterochromatin is reassembled faithfully.</description><keywords><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item></keywords><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32911</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33b92:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-j?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>62fb061d</fingerprint><author><name>Grocholski, B.</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><published>1525369184000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Smaller but more thermally stable</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/503.10.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-j?rss=1</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Materials Science</item></keywords><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/503-j?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163abdaa2b2:1ef99c9:2835af05</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36629</originId><fingerprint>ed722559</fingerprint><author><name>mackinn@mail.rockefeller.edu (Eunyong Park)</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>CLC channels mediate passive Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; conduction, while CLC transporters mediate active Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; transport coupled to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport in the opposite direction.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials have emerged as the main force in driving the development of medicine. However, little is known about the current status of clinical trials regarding nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed at providing a comprehensive landscape of NPC-related trials on the basis of ClinicalTrials.gov database.&lt;/p&gt; Patients and methods &lt;p&gt;We used the keyword “nasopharyngeal carcinoma” to search the ClinicalTrials.gov database and assessed the characteristics of these trials.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Up to December 30, 2016, 462 eligible trials in total were identified, of which 222 (48.0%) recruited only NPC (NPC trials) and the other 240 (52.0%) recruited both NPC and other cancers (multiple cancer trials). Moreover, 47 (10.2%) were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related trials and 267 (57.8%) focused on metastatic/recurrent disease.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials have emerged as the main force in driving the development of medicine. However, little is known about the current status of clinical trials regarding nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed at providing a comprehensive landscape of NPC-related trials on the basis of ClinicalTrials.gov database.&lt;/p&gt; Patients and methods &lt;p&gt;We used the keyword “nasopharyngeal carcinoma” to search the ClinicalTrials.gov database and assessed the characteristics of these trials.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Up to December 30, 2016, 462 eligible trials in total were identified, of which 222 (48.0%) recruited only NPC (NPC trials) and the other 240 (52.0%) recruited both NPC and other cancers (multiple cancer trials). Moreover, 47 (10.2%) were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related trials and 267 (57.8%) focused on metastatic/recurrent disease. Compared with NPC trials, the multiple cancer trials had a higher percentage of phase 1 (26.7% vs. 6.7%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) studies and more patients with metastatic/recurrent disease (72.5% vs. 41.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Notably, non-EBV trials had more phase 2 or 3 (78.4% vs. 48.8%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and interventional studies (89.5% vs. 70.7%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) than EBV trials. Obviously, more phase 2/3 or 3 trials were conducted in patients with non-metastatic/recurrent disease (29.4% vs. 4.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); however, metastatic/recurrent trials were more likely to be anticancer (94.6% vs. 63.6%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The role of plasma EBV DNA in clinical trials is underestimated, and high-level randomized clinical trials should be performed for patients with metastatic/recurrent disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>e6b7fb00</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196730</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_1634101a250:4d4dfe:2835af05</id><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/529/eaau0829?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/529/eaau0829.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Foley, J.

Paget’s disease of bone (PDB) is a chronic bone disorder and although genetic factors appear to play an important role in its pathogenesis, to date PDB causing mutations were identified only in the &lt;i&gt;Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)&lt;/i&gt; gene at the &lt;i&gt;PDB3&lt;/i&gt; locus. &lt;i&gt;PDB6&lt;/i&gt; locus, also previously linked to PDB, contains several candidate genes for metabolic bone diseases. We focused our analysis in the most significantly associated variant with PDB, within the &lt;i&gt;Optineurin&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;OPTN)&lt;/i&gt; gene, i.e. the common variant rs1561570. Although it was previously shown to be strongly associated with PDB in several populations, its contribution to PDB pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study we have shown that rs1561570 may contribute to PDB since its &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; allele results in the loss of a methylation site in patients’ DNA, leading to higher levels of &lt;i&gt;OPTN&lt;/i&gt; gene expression and a corresponding increase in protein levels in patients’ osteoclasts. This increase in &lt;i&gt;OPTN&lt;/i&gt; expression leads to higher levels of NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and increasing expression of its target genes, which may contribute to the overactivity of osteoclasts observed in PDB. We also reported a tendency for a more severe clinical phenotype in the presence of a haplotype containing the rs1561570 &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; allele, which appear to be re-enforced with the presence of the &lt;i&gt;SQSTM1/P392L&lt;/i&gt; mutation. In conclusion, our work provides novel insight towards understanding the functional effects of this variant, located in &lt;i&gt;OPTN&lt;/i&gt; intron 7, and its implication in the contribution to PDB pathogenesis.</content></content><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><published>1526936400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Molecular effect of an OPTN common variant associated to Paget&apos;s disease of bone</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197543</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Iris A.

LncRNAs are regulatory noncoding RNAs that play crucial roles in many biological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNA is thought to be involved in many complex diseases; lncRNAs are often the targets of miRNAs in the indirect regulation of gene expression. Numerous studies have indicated that miRNA-lncRNA interactions are closely related to the occurrence and development of cancers. Thus, it is important to develop an effective method for the identification of cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA interactions. In this study, we compiled 155653 experimentally validated and predicted miRNA-lncRNA associations, which we defined as basic interactions. We next constructed an individual-specific miRNA-lncRNA network (ISMLN) for each cancer sample and a basic miRNA-lncRNA network (BMLN) for each type of cancer by examining the expression profiles of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. We then selected potential miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers based on the BLMN. Using this method, we identified cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers and modules specific to a certain cancer. This method of profiling will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of cancers at the level of gene regulatory networks.</content></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><published>1525208400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Identification of cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers using a basic miRNA-lncRNA network</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196681</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guangle Zhang, Cong Pian, Zhi Chen, Jin Zhang, Mingmin Xu, Liangyun Zhang, Yuanyuan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. This class can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast these manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527184669816</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cZu0gxkmVxM/article</href></item></alternate><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The complex ecosystem in non small cell lung cancer invasion</title><recrawled>1527194529092</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seth Haney, Jessica Konen, Adam I.

Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. This class can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast these manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>9b9b4055</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006131</href></item></canonical></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00319/20180516/images/medium/mp-2018-00319f_0004.gif</url><height>245</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_1636aa0b520:5b67a:d63e3ae2</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00319</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00319</link><author><name>Aaron Dolor, Francis C.

The P8 stem-loop region of the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron, which is known to be hypervariable in size with multiple repeat motifs and created difficulties in alignment, is always excluded in phylogenetic as well as barcode analyses. This region was investigated for species discrimination in 98 taxa of orchids belonging to the tribe Vandeae using in silico mapping of restriction site polymorphism. The length of the P8 regions varied from 200 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Aerides rosea&lt;/i&gt; to 669 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Dendrophylax sallei&lt;/i&gt;. Forty two taxa had unique lengths, while as many as eight shared a common length of 521 nucleotides. Of the 35 restriction endonucleases producing digestions in the P8 regions, three, viz., &lt;i&gt;Ags&lt;/i&gt;I, &lt;i&gt;Apo&lt;/i&gt;I and &lt;i&gt;Tsp&lt;/i&gt;DTI turned out to have recognition sites across all the 98 taxa being studied.

The P8 stem-loop region of the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron, which is known to be hypervariable in size with multiple repeat motifs and created difficulties in alignment, is always excluded in phylogenetic as well as barcode analyses. This region was investigated for species discrimination in 98 taxa of orchids belonging to the tribe Vandeae using in silico mapping of restriction site polymorphism. The length of the P8 regions varied from 200 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Aerides rosea&lt;/i&gt; to 669 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Dendrophylax sallei&lt;/i&gt;. Forty two taxa had unique lengths, while as many as eight shared a common length of 521 nucleotides. Of the 35 restriction endonucleases producing digestions in the P8 regions, three, viz., &lt;i&gt;Ags&lt;/i&gt;I, &lt;i&gt;Apo&lt;/i&gt;I and &lt;i&gt;Tsp&lt;/i&gt;DTI turned out to have recognition sites across all the 98 taxa being studied. When their restriction data were combined, 92 taxa could be discriminated leaving three taxon pairs. However, &lt;i&gt;Acampe papillosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aeranthes arachnites&lt;/i&gt; despite having similar restriction sites differed in their P8 lengths. This is the first report on thorough investigation of the P8 region of &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron for search of species specific restriction sites and hence its use as a potential plant DNA barcode.</description><fingerprint>8165df3</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196680</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1636478e11d:3887d3e:3dd877af</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319962v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>f95f1829</fingerprint><author><name>Yang, L.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME models) enable systems-level computation of proteome allocation coupled to metabolic phenotype.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;California’s Workers’ Compensation System (CAWCS) Department of Industrial Relations questioned the adequacy of the current Medi-Cal fee-schedule pricing and requested analysis of alternatives that maximize price availability and maintain budget neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To compare CAWCS pharmacy-dispensed (PD) drug prices under alternative fee schedules, and identify combinations of alternative benchmarks that have prices available for the largest percentage of PD drugs and that best reach budget neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Claims transaction-level data (2011–2013) from CAWCS were used to estimate total annual PD pharmaceutical payments. Medi-Cal pricing data was from the Workman’s Compensation Insurance System (WCIS). Average Wholesale Prices (AWP), Wholesale Acquisition Costs (WAC), Direct Prices (DP), Federal Upper Limit (FUL) prices, and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) were from Medi-Span. We matched National Drug Codes (NDCs), pricing dates, and drug quantity for comparisons. We report pharmacy-dispensed (PD) claims frequency, reimbursement matching rate, and paid costs by CAWCS as the reference price against all alternative price benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 12,529,977 CAWCS claims for pharmaceutical products 11.6% (1,462,814) were for PD drugs. Prescription drug cost for CAWCS was over $152M; $63.9M, $47.9M, and $40.6M in 2011–2013. Ninety seven percent of these CAWCS PD claims had a Medi-Cal price.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;California’s Workers’ Compensation System (CAWCS) Department of Industrial Relations questioned the adequacy of the current Medi-Cal fee-schedule pricing and requested analysis of alternatives that maximize price availability and maintain budget neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To compare CAWCS pharmacy-dispensed (PD) drug prices under alternative fee schedules, and identify combinations of alternative benchmarks that have prices available for the largest percentage of PD drugs and that best reach budget neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Claims transaction-level data (2011–2013) from CAWCS were used to estimate total annual PD pharmaceutical payments. Medi-Cal pricing data was from the Workman’s Compensation Insurance System (WCIS). Average Wholesale Prices (AWP), Wholesale Acquisition Costs (WAC), Direct Prices (DP), Federal Upper Limit (FUL) prices, and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) were from Medi-Span. We matched National Drug Codes (NDCs), pricing dates, and drug quantity for comparisons. We report pharmacy-dispensed (PD) claims frequency, reimbursement matching rate, and paid costs by CAWCS as the reference price against all alternative price benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 12,529,977 CAWCS claims for pharmaceutical products 11.6% (1,462,814) were for PD drugs. Prescription drug cost for CAWCS was over $152M; $63.9M, $47.9M, and $40.6M in 2011–2013. Ninety seven percent of these CAWCS PD claims had a Medi-Cal price. Alternative mechanisms provided a price for fewer claims; NADAC 94.23%, AWP 90.94%, FUL 73.11%, WAC 66.98%, and DP 14.33%. Among CAWCS drugs with no Medi-Cal price in PD claims, AWP, WAC, NADAC, DP, and FUL provided prices for 96.7%, 63.14%, 24.82%, 20.83%, and 15.08% of claims. Overall CAWCS paid 100.52% of Medi-Cal, 60% of AWP, 97% of WAC, 309.53% of FUL, 103.83% of DP, and 136.27% of NADAC.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CAWCS current Medi-Cal fee-schedule price list for PD drugs is more complete than all alternative fee-schedules. However, all reimbursement approaches would require combinations of pricing benchmarks. We suggest keeping primary reimbursement at 100% of Medi-Cal and for drugs without a primary Medi-Cal price calculating the maximum fee as 60% of AWP and then 97% of WAC. Alternatively, we suggest using NADAC as a primary fee-schedule followed by either 60% AWP and 97% WAC or AWP-40% for drugs with no NADAC price. Fee-schedules may not offer the best price and a formulary approach may provide more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>86d77f6</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197449</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163819a82de:61571da:3dd877af</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5039492?af=R</originId><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5039492?af=R</link><author><name>Susan Perkin</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/19&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 19&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1526887776990</crawled><published>1526530509000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Preface: Special Topic on Chemical Physics of Ionic Liquids</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5039492?af=R</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>be2453a0</fingerprint><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00404/20180524/images/medium/bi-2018-00404a_0006.gif</url><height>270</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_163935c6690:69950:d63e3ae2</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00404</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00404</link><author><name>Dalton R.

Recent studies indicate that lifestyle factors in early life affect breast cancer risk. We therefore explored the association of high consumption of meat, milk, and whole grain products in adolescence and midlife, on breast cancer risk. We used data from the population based AGES-Reykjavik cohort (2002–2006), where 3,326 women with a mean age of 77 years (SD 6.0) participated. For food items and principal component derived dietary patterns we used Cox proportional models to calculate multivariate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). During a mean follow-up of 8.8 years, 97 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. For both adolescence and midlife, daily consumption of rye bread was positively associated with breast cancer (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–2.9, respectively). In contrast, persistent high consumption of oatmeal was negatively associated with breast cancer (0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.9). No association was found for other food items or dietary patterns that included rye bread. High rye bread consumption in adolescence and midlife may increase risk of late-life breast cancer whilst persistent consumption of oatmeal may reduce the risk.</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><published>1527714000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Dietary habits in adolescence and midlife and risk of breast cancer in older women</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198017</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>8db0474d</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfheidur Haraldsdottir, Johanna E.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Higher prevalence of suicide notes could signify more conservatism in accounting and greater proneness to undercounting of suicide by method. We tested two hypotheses: (1) an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011–2013, the study population comprised registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome measure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning suicides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof.

The prevalence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly. Probiotics supplementation have been shown to improve metabolic health in humans. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health and pregnancy complications in pregnant women. The literature search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed, and data were synthesized in accordance with standardized guidelines. Ten randomized clinical trials with eligible data were included in our meta-analysis. For pregnant women with GDM, we found negative correlations between probiotics supplementation and fasting serum insulin (OR -2.94, 95%CI [-5.69, -0.20], p = 0.04) and homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (OR -0.65, 95%CI [-1.18, -0.11], p = 0.02). There were no significant correlations between probiotics supplementation and lipid levels in women with GDM, including total cholesterol (OR -2.72, 95%CI [-17.18, 11.74], P = 0.71), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (OR -0.29, 95%CI [-3.60, 3.03], P = 0.87), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (OR -0.38, 95%CI [-18.54, 17.79], P = 0.97), or triglycerides (OR -12.83, 95%CI [-36.63, 10.97], P = 0.29). For healthy pregnant women, probiotics supplementation were negatively associated with fasting serum insulin (OR -3.76, 95%CI [-4.29, -3.23], P &amp;lt; 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (OR -0.57, 95%CI [-1.08, -0.06], p = 0.03). However, no significant correlations were observed between probiotics supplementation and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (OR -2.02, 95%CI [-5.56, 1.52], p = 0.26). Thus, our study revealed that probiotics supplementation during pregnancy have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, rather than lipid metabolism among pregnant women.</content></content><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><published>1526936400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health in pregnant women: An evidence based meta-analysis</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197771</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jia Zheng, Qianyun Feng, Sheng Zheng, Xinhua Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

We need all the reality checks we can get, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/423&quot;&gt;and this one&lt;/a&gt; (reported by a large multinational team led out of Oxford) uses light scattering to get more mass resolution than I would have thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light scattering by small particles depends on their refractive index and the particle volume. Proteins have basically the same refractive index (the indices of the individual amino acids don’t vary that much, and it’s all averaged out). Likewise, the volume occupied by each amino acid is very similar as well, and putting these together means that if you do very accurate light scattering measurements (using interferometry) the signal you get should be proportional to the number of amino acid residues or the total mass. This effect has been predicted, but recent improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to actually observe this and use it in real applications. The group gives the technique the deliberately memorable name of iSCAMS (interferometric scattering mass spectrometry), and we’ll have to get used to the idea of being able to do “mass spec” with a microscope and visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over a range of proteins (both monomers and larger oligomers), the team found a very good correlation (within 1.8%, plus or minus half a per cent) between the interferomic signature and protein mass, one that (importantly) was not influenced by the three-dimensional shape of the protein itself. The correlation also held for lipid nanodisc species, which is a good sign. And since I was writing just the other day about glycosylated proteins, I note that they also observed various states of a highly glycosylated (up to half the molecular weight) HIV envelope complex, and could spot the differences there as well. So it look like the effect holds for a number of different biomolecule types, although I expect that there will be refinements to the scattering models for these as the technique is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like it could be a very good technique for studying protein-protein interactions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the potential advantage of spatial resolution as well. I’m not sure if you could ever get something like this to work in a living cell (the signal/noise would be a huge problem), but there’s a lot of biomolecular behavior that you could get new details on short of that. There are a lot of variations to try, such as different surfaces, and immobilized binding partners. This could be a good complement to techniques like SPR, only this time at a single-protein level. It’ll be interesting to see if it can get to the point of delivering on- and off-rates, which is one of SPR’s great advantages. As it stands now, the resolution of iSCAMS doesn’t seem good enough to detect small-molecule binding to individual proteins, but it could certainly pick up small molecule effects on protein complexes, and presumably effects on protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-polysaccharide interactions as well. That should keep everyone occupied!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I’m always happy when a new analytical technique is worked out, especially one that’s applicable to biological binding assays, doesn’t require labeling of the species involved, and is orthogonal to the existing methods.

The Toda-Yamamoto test with bootstrapped critical values and the newly proposed non-linear causality test reveal no causal relationship. However, a further application of these tests using series in different time-frequency domain obtained from wavelet decomposition indicates that while energy consumption Granger causes economic growth in the short run, the reverse is true in the medium term.

Understanding complexity in physical, biological, social and information systems is predicated on describing interactions amongst different components. Advances in genomics are facilitating the high-throughput identification of molecular interactions, and graphs are emerging as indispensable tools in explaining how the connections in the network drive organismal phenotypic plasticity. Here, we describe the architectural organization and associated emergent topological properties of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that describe protein-DNA interactions (PDIs) in several model eukaryotes. By analyzing GRN connectivity, our results show that the anticipated scale-free network architectures are characterized by organism-specific power law scaling exponents. These exponents are independent of the fraction of the GRN experimentally sampled, enabling prediction of properties of the complete GRN for an organism. We further demonstrate that the exponents describe inequalities in transcription factor (TF)-target gene recognition across GRNs. These observations have the important biological implication that they predict the existence of an intrinsic organism-specific &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; regulatory landscape that constrains GRN topologies. Consequently, architectural GRN organization drives not only phenotypic plasticity within a species, but is also likely implicated in species-specific phenotype.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6xXxhGM4T7U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525110005493</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/6xXxhGM4T7U/article</href></item></alternate><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Topological and statistical analyses of gene regulatory networks reveal unifying yet quantitatively different emergent properties</title><recrawled>1525110130225</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wilberforce Zachary Ouma, Katja Pogacar, Erich Grotewold&lt;/p&gt;

The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a higher proportion of two gene clusters (&lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt;) were detected in the APN and RC groups than in CO, whereas &lt;i&gt;iutA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; clusters were detected more frequently in APN strains. The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains. In APN strains, &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; was associated with higher biofilm biomass formation, whereas &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KpSMT-K1&lt;/i&gt; were associated with a lower amount of biofilm biomass.

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197048</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

The protein kinase (PK, kinome) family is one of the largest families in plants and regulates almost all aspects of plant processes, including plant development and stress responses. Despite their important functions, comprehensive functional classification, evolutionary analysis and expression patterns of the cotton PK gene family has yet to be performed on PK genes. In this study, we identified the cotton kinomes in the &lt;i&gt;Gossypium raimondii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium arboretum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gossypium barbadense&lt;/i&gt; genomes and classified them into 7 groups and 122–24 subfamilies using software HMMER v3.0 scanning and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis.

The protein kinase (PK, kinome) family is one of the largest families in plants and regulates almost all aspects of plant processes, including plant development and stress responses. Despite their important functions, comprehensive functional classification, evolutionary analysis and expression patterns of the cotton PK gene family has yet to be performed on PK genes. In this study, we identified the cotton kinomes in the &lt;i&gt;Gossypium raimondii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium arboretum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gossypium barbadense&lt;/i&gt; genomes and classified them into 7 groups and 122–24 subfamilies using software HMMER v3.0 scanning and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. Some conserved exon-intron structures were identified not only in cotton species but also in primitive plants, ferns and moss, suggesting the significant function and ancient origination of these PK genes. Collinearity analysis revealed that 16.6 million years ago (Mya) cotton-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) events may have played a partial role in the expansion of the cotton kinomes, whereas tandem duplication (TD) events mainly contributed to the expansion of the cotton RLK group. Synteny analysis revealed that tetraploidization of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; contributed to the expansion of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; PKs. Global expression analysis of cotton PKs revealed stress-specific and fiber development-related expression patterns, suggesting that many cotton PKs might be involved in the regulation of the stress response and fiber development processes. This study provides foundational information for further studies on the evolution and molecular function of cotton PKs.</description><fingerprint>3c6cb368</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197392</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02355/20180430/images/medium/jp-2018-02355k_0006.gif</url><height>295</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_163194ffc49:14728:ed160cc3</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02355</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02355</link><author><name>Max A.

MTC properties (Vastus Lateralis, VL) physiological cross-sectional area (pCSA), quadriceps torque, patella tendon stiffness [K], Young’s modulus, volume, cross-sectional area, and length, circulating levels of TGFβ-1 and IGF-I were assessed at baseline and post RT.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Post RT, there was a significant increase in the mechanical and morphological properties of the MTC in both training groups, compared to ConM/F (p&amp;lt;0.001).

Thus, different loading patterns may be needed to maximize resistance training adaptations in each sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>17aa5de</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197852</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635ff59cc6:31f8d4d:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197136</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197136</link><author><name>Jagamya Vijayaraghavan</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jagamya Vijayaraghavan, Vijay Kumar, Nikhil P.

The bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (LT) breaks down the peptidoglycan (PG) layer during processes such as cell division. We present here crystal structures of the soluble LT Cj0843 from &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; with and without bulgecin A inhibitor in the active site. Cj0843 has a doughnut shape similar but not identical to that of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; SLT70. The C-terminal catalytic domain is preceded by an L-domain, a large helical U-domain, a flexible linker, and a small N-terminal NU-domain. The flexible linker allows the NU-domain to reach over and complete the circular shape, using residues conserved in the Epsilonproteobacteria LT family. The inner surface of the Cj0843 doughnut is mostly positively charged including a pocket that has 8 Arg/Lys residues. Molecular dynamics simulations with PG strands revealed a potential functional role for this pocket in anchoring the negatively charged terminal tetrapeptide of the PG during several steps in the reaction including homing and aligning the PG strand for exolytic cleavage, and subsequent ratcheting of the PG strand to enhance processivity in degrading PG strands.</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526323322054</crawled><published>1526331600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations suggest a processive mechanism of exolytic lytic transglycosylase from &amp;lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197136</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>6ebaf553</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jagamya Vijayaraghavan, Vijay Kumar, Nikhil P.

Background &lt;p&gt;For behaviour-change interventions to be successful they must be acceptable to users and overcome barriers to behaviour change. The Person-Based Approach can help to optimise interventions to maximise acceptability and engagement. This article presents a novel, efficient and systematic method that can be used as part of the Person-Based Approach to rapidly analyse data from development studies to inform intervention modifications. We describe how we used this approach to optimise a digital intervention for patients with hypertension (HOME BP), which aims to implement medication and lifestyle changes to optimise blood pressure control.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In study 1, hypertensive patients (N = 12) each participated in three think-aloud interviews, providing feedback on a prototype of HOME BP. In study 2 patients (N = 11) used HOME BP for three weeks and were then interviewed about their experiences. Studies 1 and 2 were used to identify detailed changes to the intervention content and potential barriers to engagement with HOME BP. In study 3 (N = 7) we interviewed hypertensive patients who were not interested in using an intervention like HOME BP to identify potential barriers to uptake, which informed modifications to our recruitment materials. Analysis in all three studies involved detailed tabulation of patient data and comparison to our modification criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Studies 1 and 2 indicated that the HOME BP procedures were generally viewed as acceptable and feasible, but also highlighted concerns about monitoring blood pressure correctly at home and making medication changes remotely. Patients in study 3 had additional concerns about the safety and security of the intervention. Modifications improved the acceptability of the intervention and recruitment materials.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This paper provides a detailed illustration of how to use the Person-Based Approach to refine a digital intervention for hypertension.

The vertebrate neuroepithelium is composed of elongated progenitors whose reciprocal attachments ensure the continuity of the ventricular wall. As progenitors commit to differentiation, they translocate their nucleus basally and eventually withdraw their apical endfoot from the ventricular surface. However, the mechanisms allowing this delamination process to take place while preserving the integrity of the neuroepithelial tissue are still unclear. Here, we show that Notch signaling, which is classically associated with an undifferentiated state, remains active in prospective neurons until they delaminate. During this transition period, prospective neurons rapidly reduce their apical surface and only later down-regulate N-Cadherin levels. Upon Notch blockade, nascent neurons disassemble their junctions but fail to reduce their apical surface. This disrupted sequence weakens the junctional network and eventually leads to breaches in the ventricular wall. We also provide evidence that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) promotes differentiation by reducing Notch signaling through a &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition mechanism. However, during the delamination process, the ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1) transiently blocks this &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition and sustains Notch activity to defer differentiation. We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111333970</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/OBYDT1hFD-8/article</href></item></alternate><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Mib1 prevents Notch &amp;lt;i&gt;Cis&amp;lt;/i&gt;-inhibition to defer differentiation and preserve neuroepithelial integrity during neural delamination</title><recrawled>1525113004990</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chooyoung Baek, Lucy Freem, Rosette Goïame, Helen Sang, Xavier Morin, Samuel Tozer&lt;/p&gt;

Visual stimuli evoke activity in visual cortical neuronal populations. Neuronal activity can be selectively modulated by particular visual stimulus parameters, such as the direction of a moving bar of light, resulting in well-defined trial averaged tuning properties. However, given any single stimulus parameter, a large number of neurons in visual cortex remain unmodulated, and the role of this untuned population is not well understood. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging to record, in an unbiased manner, from large populations of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex to describe co-varying activity on single trials in neuronal populations consisting of both tuned and untuned neurons. Specifically, we summarize pairwise covariability with an asymmetric partial correlation coefficient, allowing us to analyze the resultant population correlation structure, or functional network, with graph theory. Using the graph neighbors of a neuron, we find that the local population, including both tuned and untuned neurons, are able to predict individual neuron activity on a moment to moment basis, while also recapitulating tuning properties of tuned neurons. Variance explained in total population activity scales with the number of neurons imaged, demonstrating larger sample sizes are required to fully capture local network interactions. We also find that a specific functional triplet motif in the graph results in the best predictions, suggesting a signature of informative correlations in these populations. In summary, we show that unbiased sampling of the local population can explain single trial response variability as well as trial-averaged tuning properties in V1, and the ability to predict responses is tied to the occurrence of a functional triplet motif.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ovpobr3CnkQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525467600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525455692279</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Ovpobr3CnkQ/article</href></item></alternate><published>1525467600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Functional triplet motifs underlie accurate predictions of single-trial responses in populations of tuned and untuned V1 neurons</title><recrawled>1526503332228</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joseph B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Prolonged sitting and low activity—both common in older people—are associated with increased mortality and poorer health. Whether having a more negative attitude to ageing is associated with higher levels of these behaviours is unclear.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We investigated the prospective relationship between attitudes to ageing and objectively measured sedentary and walking behaviour.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants were 271 members of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. At age 72 years, participants completed the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire which assesses attitudes on three domains—Psychosocial loss, Physical change and Psychological growth. At age 79 years, participants wore an activPAL activity monitor for seven days. The outcome measures were average daily time spent sedentary, number of sit-to-stand transitions, and step count.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant associations between any of the Attitude to Ageing domain scores and time spent sedentary or number of sit-to-stand transitions. In sex-adjusted analysis, having a more positive attitude to ageing as regards Physical change was associated with a slightly higher daily step count, for a SD increment in score, average daily step count was greater by 1.5% (95% CI 0.6%, 2.4%). On further adjustment for potential confounding factors these associations were no longer significant.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;We found no evidence that attitudes to ageing at age 72 were predictive of sedentary or walking behaviour seven years later. Future studies should examine whether attitudes to ageing are associated with objectively measured walking or sedentary behaviour at the same point in time.

Repeated concussion is becoming increasingly recognized as a serious public health concern around the world. Moreover, there is a greater awareness amongst health professionals of the potential for repeated pediatric concussions to detrimentally alter the structure and function of the developing brain. To better study this issue, we developed an awake closed head injury (ACHI) model that enabled repeated concussions to be performed reliably and reproducibly in juvenile rats. A neurological assessment protocol (NAP) score was generated immediately after each ACHI to help quantify the cumulative effects of repeated injury on level of consciousness, and basic motor and reflexive capacity. Here we show that we can produce a repeated ACHI (4 impacts in two days) in both male and female juvenile rats without significant mortality or pain. We show that both single and repeated injuries produce acute neurological deficits resembling clinical concussion symptoms that can be quantified using the NAP score. Behavioural analyses indicate repeated ACHI acutely impaired spatial memory in the Barnes maze, and an interesting sex effect was revealed as memory impairment correlated moderately with poorer NAP score performance in a subset of females. These cognitive impairments occurred in the absence of motor impairments on the Rotarod, or emotional changes in the open field and elevated plus mazes. Cresyl violet histology and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that repeated ACHI did not produce significant structural damage. MRI also confirmed there was no volumetric loss in the cortex, hippocampus, or corpus callosum of animals at 1 or 7 days post-ACHI. Together these data indicate that the ACHI model can provide a reliable, high throughput means to study the effects of concussions in juvenile rats.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Repeated mild traumatic brain injury can cause acute neurologic impairment without overt structural damage in juvenile rats</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197187</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Meconi, Ryan C.

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><published>1525899600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A novel soft tissue prediction methodology for orthognathic surgery based on probabilistic finite element modelling</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paul G.

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>First record of &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; formation of ectomycorrhizae in &amp;lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&amp;lt;/i&gt; Sabine, a native Myrtaceae of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196984</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

Cannibalism is a commonly observed phenomenon in arthropod species having relevant consequences for population dynamics and individual fitness. It is a context-dependent behaviour and an understanding of the factors affecting cannibalism rate is crucial to highlight its ecological relevance. In mosquitoes, cannibalism between larval stages has been widely documented, and the role of density, food availability and length of contact between individuals also ascertained. However, although mosquitoes can develop in temporary water habitats with very heterogeneous topologies, the role of the site shape where cannibals and victims co-occur has been instead overlooked. In this paper, we investigated this issue by using a simulation approach and laboratory cannibalism experiments between old (third- and fourth-instars) and young (first-instar) larvae of the tiger mosquito &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. Three virtual spaces with different shapes were simulated and the number of larval encounters was estimated in each one to assess whether the spatial shape affected the number of encounters between cannibal and victims. Then, experimental trials in containers with similar shapes to those used in the simulations were performed, and the cannibalism rate was estimated at 24 and 48h. Our results showed that the spatial shape plays a role on cannibalism interactions, affecting the number of encounters between individuals. Indeed, in the experimental trials performed, we observed the highest cannibalism rate in the container with the highest number of encounters predicted by the simulations. Interestingly, we found also that spatial shape can affect cannibalism not only by affecting the number of encounters, but also the number of encounters “favorable” for cannibalistic events. Temporary waters are inhabited by several species other than mosquitoes. Our results, showing an influence of the spatial shape on cannibalism in &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; larvae, add a new critical factor to those affecting ecological interactions in these habitats.</content></content><updated>1527627600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><published>1527627600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Cannibalism in temporary waters: Simulations and laboratory experiments revealed the role of spatial shape in the mosquito &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198194</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina Mastrantonio, Graziano Crasta, Arianna Puggioli, Romeo Bellini, Sandra Urbanelli, Daniele Porretta&lt;/p&gt;

We propose GraphSeq to accelerate string graph construction by leveraging the distributed computing framework.</description><fingerprint>dab2f854</fingerprint><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321729v1?rss=1</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33bb1:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/468?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>e51a2f8d</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><published>1525369184000</published><unread>True</unread><title>News at a glance</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/468.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/468?rss=1</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Scientific Community</item></keywords><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/468?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00058/20180502/images/medium/ct-2018-00058x_0007.gif</url><height>336</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><id>nWAmhAfvfdY6zhQafSMhdWASYooG1IX3uplCe3rnLYA=_16322dd0c91:5d6bec:d27a8ff7</id><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00058</originId><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00058</link><author><name>Ka Un Lao, John M.

Background &lt;p&gt;The use of immediate breast reconstruction and adjuvant radiation therapy is increasing in breast cancer patients. This study aimed to analyze the aesthetic outcome and changes in flap volume in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy of the surgical site after immediate autologous tissue reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Immediate abdominal free flap breast reconstruction following unilateral mastectomy was performed in 42 patients; 21 patients received adjuvant radiation (study group) and 21 patients did not (control group). To compare flap volume, three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) was performed before and after radiation. Also, aesthetic analysis was performed in both groups to evaluate shape changes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There was a 12.3% flap volume reduction after the completion of radiation in the experimental group that was significantly greater than the 2.6% volume reduction observed in the non-radiation group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). There was no significant difference in the short- and long-term aesthetic results between the groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When performing immediate autologous breast reconstruction, 14% volume overcorrection is recommended for patients in whom adjuvant radiation therapy is anticipated to improve aesthetic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526936400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><published>1526936400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Objective assessment of flap volume changes and aesthetic results after adjuvant radiation therapy in patients undergoing immediate autologous breast reconstruction</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197615</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yujin Myung, Yousung Son, Tae-hyun Nam, Eunyoung Kang, Eun-Kyu Kim, In Ah Kim, Keun-Yong Eom, Chan Yeong Heo, Jae Hoon Jeong&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use in the United Arab Emirates is among the highest in the region. Use of tobacco products other than cigarettes is widespread, but little is known about specific behavior use patterns. There have been no studies that have biochemically verified smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The UAE Healthy Future Study (UAEHFS) seeks to understand the causes of non-communicable diseases through a 20,000-person cohort study. During the study pilot, 517 Emirati nationals were recruited to complete a questionnaire, provide clinical measurements and biological samples. Complete smoking data were available for 428 participants. Validation of smoking status via cotinine testing was conducted based on complete questionnaire data and matching urine samples for 399 participants, using a cut-off of 200ng/ml to indicate active smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use was 36% among men and 3% among women in the sample. However, biochemical verification of smoking status revealed that 42% men and 9% of women were positive for cotinine indicating possible recent tobacco use. Dual and poly-use of tobacco products was fairly common with 32% and 6% of the sample reporting respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study in the region to biochemically verify tobacco use self-report data.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use in the United Arab Emirates is among the highest in the region. Use of tobacco products other than cigarettes is widespread, but little is known about specific behavior use patterns. There have been no studies that have biochemically verified smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The UAE Healthy Future Study (UAEHFS) seeks to understand the causes of non-communicable diseases through a 20,000-person cohort study. During the study pilot, 517 Emirati nationals were recruited to complete a questionnaire, provide clinical measurements and biological samples. Complete smoking data were available for 428 participants. Validation of smoking status via cotinine testing was conducted based on complete questionnaire data and matching urine samples for 399 participants, using a cut-off of 200ng/ml to indicate active smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use was 36% among men and 3% among women in the sample. However, biochemical verification of smoking status revealed that 42% men and 9% of women were positive for cotinine indicating possible recent tobacco use. Dual and poly-use of tobacco products was fairly common with 32% and 6% of the sample reporting respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study in the region to biochemically verify tobacco use self-report data. Tobacco use in this study population was found to be higher than previously thought, especially among women. Misclassification of smoking status was more common than expected. Poly-tobacco use was also very common. Additional studies are needed to understand tobacco use behaviors and the extent to which people may be exposed to passive tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt; Implications &lt;p&gt;This study is the first in the region to biochemically verify self-reported smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b93:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</canonicalUrl><author><name>Miklós Lengyel</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miklós Lengyel, Gábor Czirják, Péter Enyedi&lt;/p&gt;

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are one of the important factors in controlling gene expression and elucidation of their roles has been attracting great interest. We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><published>1525726800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>High-throughput evaluation of T7 promoter variants using biased randomization and DNA barcoding</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196905</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Komura, Wataru Aoki, Keisuke Motone, Atsushi Satomura, Mitsuyoshi Ueda&lt;/p&gt;

Treatment of prosthetic joint infections often involves multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic administration, resulting in a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system. We are exploring a non-invasive method to eradicate biofilm on metal implants utilizing high-frequency alternating magnetic fields (AMF) which can achieve surface induction heating. Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Remote acoustic sensing as a safety mechanism during exposure of metal implants to alternating magnetic fields</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197380</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bingbing Cheng, Yonatan Chatzinoff, Debby Szczepanski, Chenchen Bing, Sumbul Shaikh, Omar Wyman, Cameron E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstetric complications and maternal deaths can be prevented through safe delivery process. Facility based delivery significantly reduces maternal mortality by increasing women’s access to skilled personnel attendance. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, most deliveries take place without skilled attendants and outside health facilities. Utilization of facility-based delivery is affected by socio-cultural norms and several other factors including cost, long distance, accessibility and availability of quality services. This study examined country-level variations of the self-reported causes of not choosing to deliver at a health facility.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional data on 37,086 community dwelling women aged between 15–49 years were collected from DHS surveys in Ethiopia (n = 13,053) and Nigeria (n = 24,033). Outcome variables were the self-reported causes of not delivering at health facilities which were regressed against selected sociodemographic and community level determinants. In total eight items complaints were identified for non-use of facility delivery: 1) Cost too much 2) Facility not open, 3) Too far/no transport, 4) don’t trust facility/poor service, 5) No female provider, 6) Husband/family didn’t allow, 7) Not necessary, 8) Not customary. Multivariable regression methods were used for measuring the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In both countries a large proportion of the women mentioned facility delivery as not necessary, 54.9% (52.3–57.9) in Nigeria and 45.4% (42.0–47.5) in Ethiopia. Significant urban-rural variations were observed in the prevalence of the self-reported causes of non-utilisation. Women in the rural areas are more likely to report delivering at health facility as not customary/not necessary and healthy facility too far/no transport. However, urban women were more likely to complain that husband/family did not allow and that the costs were too high.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Women in the rural were more likely to regard facility delivery as unnecessary and complain about transportation and financial difficulties. In order to achieving the maternal mortality related targets, addressing regional disparities in accessing maternal healthcare services should be regarded as a priority of health promotion programs in Nigeria and Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Why some women fail to give birth at health facilities: A comparative study between Ethiopia and Nigeria</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196896</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanni Yaya, Ghose Bishwajit, Olalekan A.

&lt;i&gt;Lactococcus lactis&lt;/i&gt; is an ovoid bacterium that forms filaments during planktonic and biofilm lifestyles by uncoupling cell division from cell elongation. In this work, we investigate the role of the leading peptidoglycan synthase PBP2b that is dedicated to cell elongation in ovococci. We show that the localization of a fluorescent derivative of PBP2b remains associated to the septal region and superimposed with structural changes of FtsZ during both vegetative growth and filamentation indicating that PBP2b remains intimately associated to the division machinery during the whole cell cycle. In addition, we show that PBP2b-negative cells of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lactis&lt;/i&gt; are not only defective in peripheral growth; they are also affected in septum positioning. This septation defect does not simply result from the absence of the protein in the cell growth machinery since it is also observed when PBP2b-deficient cells are complemented by a catalytically inactive variant of PBP2b. Finally, we show that round cells resulting from β-lactam treatment are not altered in septation, suggesting that shape elongation as such is not a major determinant for selection of the division site. Altogether, we propose that the specific PBP2b transpeptidase activity at the septum plays an important role for tagging future division sites during &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lactis&lt;/i&gt; cell cycle.</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><published>1527109200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>PBP2b plays a key role in both peripheral growth and septum positioning in &amp;lt;i&gt;Lactococcus lactis&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198014</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Blandine David, Marie-Clémence Duchêne, Gabrielle Laurie Haustenne, Daniel Pérez-Núñez, Marie-Pierre Chapot-Chartier, Xavier De Bolle, Eric Guédon, Pascal Hols, Bernard Hallet&lt;/p&gt;

Ongoing acidification of the ocean through uptake of anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is known to affect marine biota and ecosystems with largely unknown consequences for marine food webs. Changes in food web structure have the potential to alter trophic transfer, partitioning, and biogeochemical cycling of elements in the ocean. Here we investigated the impact of realistic end-of-the-century CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations on the development and partitioning of the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica pools in a coastal pelagic ecosystem (Gullmar Fjord, Sweden). We covered the entire winter-to-summer plankton succession (100 days) in two sets of five pelagic mesocosms, with one set being CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enriched (~760 μatm &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the other one left at ambient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. Elemental mass balances were calculated and we highlight important challenges and uncertainties we have faced in the closed mesocosm system. Our key observations under high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were: (1) A significantly amplified transfer of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from primary producers to higher trophic levels, during times of regenerated primary production. (2) A prolonged retention of all three elements in the pelagic food web that significantly reduced nitrogen and phosphorus sedimentation by about 11 and 9%, respectively. (3) A positive trend in carbon fixation (relative to nitrogen) that appeared in the particulate matter pool as well as the downward particle flux. This excess carbon counteracted a potential reduction in carbon sedimentation that could have been expected from patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes. Our findings highlight the potential for ocean acidification to alter partitioning and cycling of carbon and nutrients in the surface ocean but also show that impacts are temporarily variable and likely depending upon the structure of the plankton food web.</content></content><updated>1527282000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><published>1527282000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Enhanced transfer of organic matter to higher trophic levels caused by ocean acidification and its implications for export production: A mass balance approach</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197502</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Boxhammer, Jan Taucher, Lennart T.

There have not been any records of the species outside of Oman.

Because mean diurnal range will not be influenced by climate change in future, the potential distribution of the species is not expected to be changed in 2050. All predicted models were performed with the highest AUC (more than 0.97) using the Maxent method.

Bacteria belonging to the genus &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; have been frequently found in association with a wide variety of marine eukaryotic invertebrate hosts, indicative of their versatile and symbiotic lifestyle. A recent comparison of the sponge-associated &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; genomes has shed light on the mechanisms influencing a successful symbiotic association with sponges. In contrast, the genomic architecture of &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; bacteria associated with other marine hosts has received less attention. Here, we performed genus-wide comparative analyses of 18 &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; isolated from sponges, coral, tunicates, flatworm, and seawater. The analyses revealed a certain degree of commonality among the majority of sponge- and coral-associated bacteria. Isolates from other marine invertebrate host, tunicates, exhibited a genetic repertoire for cold adaptation and specific metabolic abilities including mucin degradation in the Antarctic tunicate-associated bacterium &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; sp.

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526580501938</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/NEnghs1B4I8/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526590800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Firing-rate based network modeling of the dLGN circuit: Effects of cortical feedback on spatiotemporal response properties of relay cells</title><recrawled>1526589728774</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.

Mesothelin is a cell surface protein that is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, liver, and pancreatic tumors. Aberrant expression of mesothelin has been shown to promote tumor progression and metastasis through interaction with established tumor biomarker CA125. Therefore, molecules that specifically bind to mesothelin have potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, no mesothelin-targeting molecules are currently approved for routine clinical use. While antibodies that target mesothelin are in development, some clinical applications may require a targeting molecule with an alternative protein fold. For example, non-antibody proteins are more suitable for molecular imaging and may facilitate diverse chemical conjugation strategies to create drug delivery complexes. In this work, we engineered variants of the fibronectin type III domain (Fn3) non-antibody protein scaffold to bind to mesothelin with high affinity, using directed evolution and yeast surface display. Lead engineered Fn3 variants were solubly produced and purified from bacterial culture at high yield. Upon specific binding to mesothelin on human cancer cell lines, the engineered Fn3 proteins internalized and co-localized to early endosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-antibody proteins engineered to bind mesothelin. The results validate that non-antibody proteins can be engineered to bind to tumor biomarker mesothelin, and encourage the continued development of engineered variants for applications such as targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Fn3 proteins engineered to recognize tumor biomarker mesothelin internalize upon binding</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197029</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allison R.

Limited information is available on influenza virus sequence drift between transmission events. In countries with high HIV burdens, like South Africa, the direct and indirect effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events may be of public health concern. To this end, we measured hemagglutinin sequence diversity between influenza transmission events using data and specimens from a study investigating household transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses in 2 peri-urban communities in South Africa during the 2013 influenza season. Thirty index cases and 107 of 110 eligible household contacts were enrolled into the study, 47% (14/30) demonstrating intra-household laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission. In this study 35 partial hemagglutinin gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing from 11 index cases (sampled at enrolment only) and 16 secondary cases (8 cases sampled at 1 and 8 cases sampled at 2 time-points). Viral sequence identities confirmed matched influenza transmission pairs within the 11 households with corresponding sequenced index and secondary cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 different influenza viral lineages in the 14 households. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains were shown to be genetically distinct between the 2 communities (from distinct geographic regions), which was not observed for the influenza A(H3N2) strains. Intra-host/intra-household influenza A(H3N2) sequence drift was identified in 2 households. The first was a synonymous mutation between the index case and a household contact, and the second a non-synonymous mutation between 2 serial samples taken at days 0 and 4 post enrolment from an HIV-infected secondary case. Limited inter-household sequence diversity was observed as highlighted by sharing of the same influenza strain between different households within each community. The limited intra-household sequence drift is in line with previous studies also using Sanger sequencing, corroborating the presence of strict selective bottlenecks that limit sequence variance. We were not able to directly ascertain the effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events.</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Intra-host and intra-household diversity of influenza A viruses during household transmissions in the 2013 season in 2 peri-urban communities of South Africa</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198101</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ziyaad Valley-Omar, Preetha Iyengar, Claire von Mollendorf, Stefano Tempia, Alexandra Moerdyk, Orienka Hellferscee, Neil Martinson, Meredith McMorrow, Ebrahim Variava, Katlego Masonoke, Adam L.

The limited intra-household sequence drift is in line with previous studies also using Sanger sequencing, corroborating the presence of strict selective bottlenecks that limit sequence variance. We were not able to directly ascertain the effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events.</description><fingerprint>6787ac65</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198101</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1636a23b7f9:4205bdd:3dd877af</id><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaat8531?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/441/eaat8531.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Tully, H.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major mediator of peritoneal fibrosis and reportedly affects expression of the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9. SET7/9-induced H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) critically activates transcription of fibrosis-related genes. In this study, we examined the effect of SET7/9 inhibition on peritoneal fibrosis in mice and in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). We also examined SET7/9 expression in nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Murine peritoneal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) into male C57/BL6 mice over 21 days. Sinefungin, a SET7/9 inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously just before MGO injection (10 mg/kg). SET7/9 expression was elevated in both MGO-injected mice and nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of PD patients. SET7/9 expression was positively correlated with dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine in PD patients. Sinefungin was shown immunohistochemically to suppress expression of mesenchymal cells and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased H3K4me1 levels. Peritoneal equilibration tests showed that sinefungin attenuated the urea nitrogen transport rate from plasma and the glucose absorption rate from the dialysate. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, sinefungin suppressed TGF-β1-induced expression of fibrotic markers and inhibited H3K4me1. These findings suggest that inhibiting the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis.</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Inhibition of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196844</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Tamura, Shigehiro Doi, Ayumu Nakashima, Kensuke Sasaki, Kazuya Maeda, Toshinori Ueno, Takao Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

The source code and web application are available at github.com/dphansti/Coral. html and phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu/Coral respectively.</description><engagementRate>0.5</engagementRate><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/330274</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/330274v1?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26304-9/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26304_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>612</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1638723ede1:6bed1e2:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</link><author><name>Pol Sopeña</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26304-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Za9VfSXdeP8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526980668897</crawled><published>1526972400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Za9VfSXdeP8/s41598-018-26304-9</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26304-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Za9VfSXdeP8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><fingerprint>73e96e44</fingerprint><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</href></item></canonical></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/21.cover-source.jpg?itok=3_ebjn-v</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16388d6a7d9:6ccef74:3dd877af</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5582.short?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5582</canonicalUrl><author><name>Leonardo Fazio, Giulio Pergola, Marco Papalino, Pasquale Di Carlo, Anna Monda, Barbara Gelao, Nicola Amoroso, Sabina Tangaro, Antonio Rampino, Teresa Popolizio, Alessandro Bertolino, Giuseppe Blasi</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) signaling shapes prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during working memory (WM).

The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of xenobiotic mixtures containing persistent organic pollutants isolated from commercial fish oil samples against sex hormone receptors, including estrogen and androgen. The applied bioassay was based on transgenic yeast strains. The mixtures were extracted from the samples using the semi-permeable membrane dialysis technique and analyzed with gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. It turned out that mixtures of chemicals isolated from fish oil may interact with human steroid sex hormone receptors in various ways: the tested samples showed both estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Calculated 17β-estradiol equivalents for the tested samples ranged between 0.003 and 0.073 pg g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat). Anti-androgenic activity expressed as the flutamide equivalent concentration was in the 18.58–216.21 ng g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat) range. Polychlorinated biphenyls and various DDT metabolites were the main fish oil pollutants influencing the receptors. Additivity and/or synergy between chemicals was observed in the ER/AR mediated response.</content></content><updated>1527022800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><published>1527022800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Endocrine disrupting potency of organic pollutant mixtures isolated from commercial fish oil evaluated in yeast-based bioassays</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197907</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marek Łukasz Roszko, Marta Kamińska, Krystyna Szymczyk, Katarzyna Piasecka-Jóźwiak, Beata Chabłowska&lt;/p&gt;

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood.

Alexander D.MacKerellJr.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>In this work, we have combined the polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillator with a continuum Poisson–Boltzmann/solvent‐accessible surface area (PB/SASA) model. In practice, the positions of the Drude particles experiencing the solvent reaction field arising from the fixed charges and induced polarization of the solute must be optimized in a self‐consistent manner. Here, we parameterized the model to reproduce experimental solvation free energies of a set of small molecules. The model reproduces well‐experimental solvation free energies of 70 molecules, yielding a root mean square difference of 0.8 kcal/mol versus 2.5 kcal/mol for the CHARMM36 additive force field. The polarization work associated with the solute transfer from the gas‐phase to the polar solvent, a term neglected in the framework of additive force fields, was found to make a large contribution to the total solvation free energy, comparable to the polar solute–solvent solvation contribution.

In practice, the positions of the Drude particles experiencing the solvent reaction field arising from the fixed charges and induced polarization of the solute must be optimized in a self‐consistent manner. Here, we parameterized the model to reproduce experimental solvation free energies of a set of small molecules. The model reproduces well‐experimental solvation free energies of 70 molecules, yielding a root mean square difference of 0.8 kcal/mol versus 2.5 kcal/mol for the CHARMM36 additive force field. The polarization work associated with the solute transfer from the gas‐phase to the polar solvent, a term neglected in the framework of additive force fields, was found to make a large contribution to the total solvation free energy, comparable to the polar solute–solvent solvation contribution. The Drude PB/SASA also reproduces well the electronic polarization from the explicit solvent simulations of a small protein, BPTI. Model validation was based on comparisons with the experimental relative binding free energies of 371 single alanine mutations. With the Drude PB/SASA model the root mean square deviation between the predicted and experimental relative binding free energies is 3.35 kcal/mol, lower than 5.11 kcal/mol computed with the CHARMM36 additive force field.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest. Socioeconomic status and comorbidity were major confounders of costs. The outcome measures of cardiac arrest should extend beyond the death, and encompass destitution. These findings add to our knowledge of the health economics and indicate future research about healthcare of cardiac arrest survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><published>1525208400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>One-year survival rate and healthcare costs after cardiac arrest in Taiwan, 2006–2012</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196687</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yi-Ming Weng, Chip-Jin Ng, Chen-June Seak, Cheng-Yu Chien, Kuan-Fu Chen, Jr-Rung Lin, Chee-Jen Chang&lt;/p&gt;

A novel α-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 was cloned from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/i&gt;, overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and characterized. The purified enzyme Aga-BC7050 was 85 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and 168 kDa according to gel filtration, indicating that its native structure is a dimer. With &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl-α-d- galactopyranoside (pNPGal) as the substrate, optimal temperature and pH were 55 °C and 6.0, respectively. At 60 °C for 30 min, it retained &gt; 50% of its activity. It was stable at pH 5.0–10.0, and showed remarkable resistance to proteinase K, subtilisin A, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in &amp;lt; 30 min. These characteristics suggest that Aga-BC7050 could be used in feed and food industries and sugar processing.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A novel α-galactosidase from the thermophilic probiotic &amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&amp;lt;/i&gt; with remarkable protease-resistance and high hydrolytic activity</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197067</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ruili Zhao, Rui Zhao, Yishuai Tu, Xiaoming Zhang, Liping Deng, Xiangdong Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Study objectives &lt;p&gt;In order to increase the value of randomized response techniques (RRTs) as tools for studying sensitive issues, the present study investigated whether the prevalence estimate for a sensitive item π^s assessed with the unrelated questionnaire method (UQM) is influenced by changing the probability of receiving the sensitive question &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;A short paper-and-pencil questionnaire was distributed to 1.243 university students assessing the 12-month prevalence of physical and cognitive doping using two versions of the UQM with different probabilities for receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3). Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess whether the prevalence estimates for physical and cognitive doping differed significantly between &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. The order of questions (physical doping and cognitive doping) as well as the probability of receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3) were counterbalanced across participants. Statistical power analyses were performed to determine sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence estimate for physical doping with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 was 22.5% (95% CI: 10.8–34.1), and 12.8% (95% CI: 7.6–18.0) with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. For cognitive doping with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3, the estimated prevalence was 22.5% (95% CI: 11.0–34.1), whereas it was 18.0% (95% CI: 12.5–23.5) with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3.

As global political preeminence gradually shifted from the United Kingdom to the United States, so did the capacity to culturally influence the rest of the world. In this work, we analyze how the world-wide varieties of written English are evolving. We study both the spatial and temporal variations of vocabulary and spelling of English using a large corpus of geolocated tweets and the Google Books datasets corresponding to books published in the US and the UK. The advantage of our approach is that we can address both standard written language (Google Books) and the more colloquial forms of microblogging messages (Twitter). We find that American English is the dominant form of English outside the UK and that its influence is felt even within the UK borders. Finally, we analyze how this trend has evolved over time and the impact that some cultural events have had in shaping it.</content></content><updated>1527282000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><published>1527282000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Mapping the Americanization of English in space and time</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197741</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Gonçalves, Lucía Loureiro-Porto, José J.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutants have been associated with differences in clinical and virological characteristics. Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to alter this process to survive in host cells. In this work, we studied the modulation of autophagy by the replication of HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4, and the naturally occurring mutants BCP and preCore. HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induced accumulation of autophagosomes in hepatoma cells. However, no autophagic protein degradation was observed, indicating a blockage of autophagic flux at later stages. This inhibition of autophagy flux might be due to an impairment of lysosomal acidification in hepatoma cells. Moreover, HBV-mediated autophagy modulation was independent of the viral subgenotypes and enhanced in viruses with BCP and preCore naturally occurring mutations. These results contribute to understand the mechanisms by which different HBV variants contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infections. In addition, this study is the first to describe the role that two highly prevalent naturally occurring mutations exert on the modulation of HBV-induced autophagy.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induces an incomplete autophagic process in hepatocytes: Role of BCP and preCore mutations</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197109</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Mercedes Elizalde, Paula Soledad Pérez, Ina Sevic, Daniel Grasso, Alejandro Ropolo, Luciana Barbini, Rodolfo Héctor Campos, María Inés Vaccaro, Diego Martín Flichman&lt;/p&gt;

Tuberculosis (TB) in animals is a re-emerging disease with a wide range of hosts that causes large economic losses in livestock. Goats are particularly susceptible to TB and, in endemic areas, vaccination may be a valuable measure to control the disease. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of parenteral vaccination of goats with a heat-inactivated &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&lt;/i&gt; (HIMB) vaccine, and compare it to M. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Twenty-four goat kids were divided in 3 groups as following: HIMB vaccinated group (n = 8), BCG vaccinated group (n = 8) and unvaccinated group (n = 8). Afterwards, goats were experimentally challenged with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium caprae&lt;/i&gt; by the endobronchial route. Antigen specific interferon-γ release assays and serology were performed after vaccination and challenge. Pathological and bacteriological parameters were evaluated after necropsy at 9 weeks post-challenge (p.c.). HIMB vaccine showed similar levels of protection to BCG in terms of volume reduction of thoracic TB lesions, presence of extra-pulmonary lesions, as well as a slight reduction of bacterial load in pulmonary lymph nodes. Moreover, HIMB vaccine did not induce interferences on the interferon-γ release assay based on reagents previously developed to differentiate infected from BCG vaccinated individuals. The results indicate that HIMB is a suitable vaccine candidate for further larger-scale trials under field conditions in goats.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><published>1525899600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Efficacy of parenteral vaccination against tuberculosis with heat-inactivated &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&amp;lt;/i&gt; in experimentally challenged goats</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196948</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudia Arrieta-Villegas, Tania Perálvarez, Enric Vidal, Zoë Puighibet, Xavier Moll, Albert Canturri, Iker A.

Monitoring of small ruminants for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has recently become more relevant after two natural scrapie suspected cases of goats were found to be positive for classical BSE (C-BSE). C-BSE probably established itself in this species unrecognized, undermining disease control measures. This opens the possibility that TSEs in goats may remain an animal source for human prion diseases. Currently, there are no data regarding the natural presence of the atypical BSE in caprines. Here we report that C-BSE and L-type atypical BSE (L-BSE) isolates from bovine species are intracerebrally transmissible to goats, with a 100% attack rate and a significantly shorter incubation period and survival time after C-BSE than after L-BSE experimental infection, suggesting a lower species barrier for classical agentin goat. All animals showed nearly the same clinical features of disease characterized by skin lesions, including broken hair and alopecia, and abnormal mental status. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed several differences between C-BSE and L-BSE infection, allowing discrimination between the two different strains. The lymphoreticular involvement we observed in the C-BSE positive goats argues in favour of a peripheral distribution of PrPSc similar to classical scrapie. Western blot and other currently approved screening tests detected both strains in the goats and were able to classify negative control animals. These data demonstrate that active surveillance of small ruminants, as applied to fallen stock and/or healthy slaughter populations in European countries, is able to correctly identify and classify classical and L-BSE and ultimately protect public health.</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Clinical, pathological, and molecular features of classical and L-type atypical-BSE in goats</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198037</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elena Vallino Costassa, Antonio D’Angelo, Maria Mazza, Daniela Meloni, Elisa Baioni, Cristiana Maurella, Silvia Colussi, Nicola Martinelli, Monica Lo Faro, Elena Berrone, Alessandra Favole, Paola Crociara, Silvia Grifoni, Marina Gallo, Guerino Lombardi, Barbara Iulini, Cristina Casalone, Cristiano Corona&lt;/p&gt;

Populations with obesity are more likely to fall and exhibit balance instability. The reason for this is likely multifactorial, but there is some evidence that sensory function is impaired during obesity. We tested the hypothesis that muscle proprioceptor function is compromised in a mouse model of diet induced obesity. An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; muscle-nerve preparation was used to record muscle spindle afferent responses to physiological stretch and sinusoidal vibration. We compared the responses of C57/Bl6 male and female mice on a control diet (10% kcal fat) with those eating a high fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) for 10 weeks (final age 14–15 weeks old). Following HFD feeding, adult mice of both sexes exhibited decreased muscle spindle afferent responses to muscle movement. Muscle spindle afferent firing rates during the plateau phase of stretch were significantly lower in both male and female HFD animals as were two measures of dynamic sensitivity (dynamic peak and dynamic index). Muscle spindle afferents in male mice on a HFD were also significantly less likely to entrain to vibration. Due to the importance of muscle spindle afferents to proprioception and motor control, decreased muscle spindle afferent responsiveness may contribute to balance instability during obesity.</content></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><published>1525294800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Diet induced obesity alters muscle spindle afferent function in adult mice</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196832</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lubayna S.

To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/282269</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282269v3?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f5:f3bf0074</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005056</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005056</link><author><name>Antoine Frenoy</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;
The stress-induced mutagenesis hypothesis postulates that in response to stress, bacteria increase their genome-wide mutation rate, in turn increasing the chances that a descendant is able to better withstand the stress. This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell divisions are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YW43eur48VA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060694416</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/YW43eur48VA/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Death and population dynamics affect mutation rate estimates and evolvability under stress in bacteria</title><recrawled>1527181201615</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Achieving proper rotational alignment of the femoral component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for valgus knee is challenging because of lateral condylar hypoplasia and lateral cartilage erosion. Gap-based navigation-assisted TKA enables surgeons to determine the angle of femoral component rotation (FCR) based on the posterior condylar axis. This study evaluated the possible factors that affect the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Between 2008 and 2016, 28 knees were enrolled. The dependent variable for this study was FCR based on the posterior condylar axis, which was obtained from the navigation system archives. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might predict FCR, including body mass index (BMI), Kellgren-Lawrence grade (K-L grade), lateral distal femoral angles obtained from the navigation system and radiographs (NaviLDFA, XrayLDFA), hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis, lateral gap under varus stress (LGVS), medial gap under valgus stress (MGVS), and side-to-side difference (STSD, MGVS − LGVS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean FCR was 6.1° ± 2.0°. Of all the potentially predictive factors evaluated in this study, only NaviLDFA (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = −0.668) and XrayLDFA (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = −0.714) predicted significantly FCR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The LDFAs, as determined using radiographs and the navigation system, were both predictive of the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis in gap-based TKA for valgus knee. A 1° increment with NaviLDFA led to a 0.668° decrement in FCR, and a 1° increment with XrayLDFA led to a 0.714° decrement. This suggests that symmetrical lateral condylar hypoplasia of the posterior and distal side occurs in lateral compartment end-stage osteoarthritis with valgus deformity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><published>1526418000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Factors affecting femoral rotational angle based on the posterior condylar axis in gap-based navigation-assisted total knee arthroplasty for valgus knee</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197335</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sung-Sahn Lee, Yong-In Lee, Dong-Uk Kim, Dae-Hee Lee, Young-Wan Moon&lt;/p&gt;

Using 3D anatomical landmarks from adult human head MRIs, we assessed the magnitude of inter-operator differences in Procrustes-based geometric morphometric analyses. An in depth analysis of both absolute and relative error was performed in a subsample of individuals with replicated digitization by three different operators. The effect of inter-operator differences was also explored in a large sample of more than 900 individuals. Although absolute error was not unusual for MRI measurements, including bone landmarks, shape was particularly affected by differences among operators, with up to more than 30% of sample variation accounted for by this type of error. The magnitude of the bias was such that it dominated the main pattern of bone and total (all landmarks included) shape variation, largely surpassing the effect of sex differences between hundreds of men and women. In contrast, however, we found higher reproducibility in soft-tissue nasal landmarks, despite relatively larger errors in estimates of nasal size. Our study exemplifies the assessment of measurement error using geometric morphometrics on landmarks from MRIs and stresses the importance of relating it to total sample variance within the specific methodological framework being used. In summary, precise landmarks may not necessarily imply negligible errors, especially in shape data; indeed, size and shape may be differentially impacted by measurement error and different types of landmarks may have relatively larger or smaller errors. Importantly, and consistently with other recent studies using geometric morphometrics on digital images (which, however, were not specific to MRI data), this study showed that inter-operator biases can be a major source of error in the analysis of large samples, as those that are becoming increasingly common in the &apos;era of big data&apos;.</content></content><updated>1527022800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><published>1527022800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Procrustes-based geometric morphometrics on MRI images: An example of inter-operator bias in 3D landmarks and its impact on big datasets</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197675</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amro Daboul, Tatyana Ivanovska, Robin Bülow, Reiner Biffar, Andrea Cardini&lt;/p&gt;

Cave roosting bats represent an important component of Southeast Asian bat diversity and are vulnerable to human disturbance during critical reproductive periods (pregnancy, lactation and weaning). Because dramatic growth of cave tourism in recent decades has raised concerns about impacts on cave bats in the region, we assessed the reproductive phenology of two insectivorous species (&lt;i&gt;Hipposideros larvatus&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato and &lt;i&gt;Taphozous melanopogon&lt;/i&gt;) at three caves in Cambodia for 23 months in 2014–2016 and evaluated human visitation to these sites between 2007 and 2014. Despite the differing foraging strategies employed by the two taxa, the temporal consistency observed in proportions of pregnant, lactating and juvenile bats indicates that their major birth peaks coincide with the time of greatest cave visitation annually, particularly for domestic visitors and namely during the Cambodian new year in April. They also reflect rainfall patterns and correspond with the reproductive phenology of insectivorous cave bats in Vietnam. These findings were predictable because 1) insect biomass and thus food availability for insectivorous bats are optimal for ensuring survival of young following this period, and 2) the Khmer new year is the most significant month for religious ceremonies and thus domestic cave visitation nationally, due to the abundance of Buddhist shrines and temples in Cambodian caves. While the impact of visitor disturbance on bat population recruitment cannot be empirically assessed due to lack of historical data, it is nonetheless likely to have been considerable and raises a conservation concern. Further, because growing evidence suggests that insectivorous cave bats exhibit reproductive synchrony across continental Southeast Asia where countless cave shrines are heavily frequented during April in Theravada Buddhist countries (e.g., Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos), our results may have wider applicability in the region. We consequently advocate for increased emphasis on sustainable cave management practices in Cambodia and further investigations to determine whether our findings present a broader concern for cave bat conservation in Southeast Asia.</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Insectivorous bat reproduction and human cave visitation in Cambodia: A perfect conservation storm?</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196554</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thona Lim, Julien Cappelle, Thavry Hoem, Neil Furey&lt;/p&gt;

This paper presents a robust 3D point cloud registration algorithm based on bidirectional Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC). Comparing with traditional registration algorithm based on the mean square error (MSE), using the MCC is superior in dealing with complex registration problem with non-Gaussian noise and large outliers. Since the MCC is considered as a probability measure which weights the corresponding points for registration, the noisy points are penalized. Moreover, we propose to use bidirectional measures which can maximum the overlapping parts and avoid the registration result being trapped into a local minimum. Both of these strategies can better apply the information theory method to the point cloud registration problem, making the algorithm more robust. In the process of implementation, we integrate the fixed-point optimization technique based on the iterative closest point algorithm, resulting in the correspondence and transformation parameters that are solved iteratively. The comparison experiments under noisy conditions with related algorithms have demonstrated good performance of the proposed algorithm.</content></content><updated>1527282000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><published>1527282000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Robust 3D point cloud registration based on bidirectional Maximum Correntropy Criterion</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197542</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuetao Zhang, Libo Jian, Meifeng Xu&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5–60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)—Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-Lung&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)—as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT—because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer—are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift). Patients with a negative AABT, and those scheduled for CT surveillance alone, are assumed to have periodic CT screenings to detect rapid growth and thus to have their lung cancers diagnosed—on average—at more advanced stages.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 1,000 patients who have incidentally detected nodules 8–30 mm, have an intermediate-risk of lung cancer, and are evaluated by CT surveillance alone, 95 (9.5%) are assumed to have lung cancer (local, 73.6%; regional, 22.0%; distant, 4.4%). With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 41%/93% (stage shift = 10.8%), although expected costs would be higher by $949,442 ($949 per person), life years would be higher by 53 (0.05 per person), resulting in a cost per life-year gained of $18,029 and a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $24,330. With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 28%/98% (stage shift = 7.4%), corresponding cost-effectiveness ratios would be $18,454 and $24,833.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Under our base-case assumptions, and reasonable variations thereof, using AABT as an aid in the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules who are estimated to be at intermediate risk of lung cancer and are scheduled for CT surveillance alone is likely to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527022800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><published>1527022800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (&amp;lt;i&gt;Early&amp;lt;/i&gt;CDT-Lung) as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197826</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by John Edelsberg, Derek Weycker, Mark Atwood, Geoffrey Hamilton-Fairley, James R.

Systematics is considered important for effective toothbrushing. A theoretical concept of systematics in toothbrushing and a validated index to quantify it using observational data is suggested. The index consists of three components: completeness (all areas of the dentition reached), isochronicity (all areas brushed equally long) and consistency (avoiding frequent alternations between areas). Toothbrushing should take a sufficient length of time; therefore, this parameter is part of the index value calculation. Quantitative data from video observations were used including the number of changes between areas, number of areas reached, absolute brushing time and brushing time per area. These data were fed into two algorithms that converted the behaviour into two index values (each with values between 0 and 1) and were summed as the Toothbrushing Systematics Index (TSI) value; 0 indicates completely unsystematic and 2 indicates perfectly systematic brushing. The index was developed using theoretical data. The data matrices revealed the highest values when all areas are reached and brushed equally long. Few changes occurred between the areas when the brushing duration was ≥90 s; the lowest values occurred under opposite conditions. Clinical applicability was tested with data from re-analysed videos from an earlier intervention study aiming to establish a pre-defined toothbrushing sequence. Subjects who fully adopted this sequence had a baseline TSI of 1.30±0.26, which increased to 1.74±0.09 after the intervention (p≤0.001). When the participants who only partially adopted the sequence were included, the respective values were 1.25±0.27 and 1.69±0.14 (p≤0.001). The suggested new TS-index can cover a variety of clinically meaningful variations of systematic brushing, validly quantifies the changes in toothbrushing systematics and has discriminative power.</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Toothbrushing Systematics Index (TSI) – A new tool for quantifying systematics in toothbrushing behaviour</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196497</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadine Schlueter, Katrin Winterfeld, Vicenç Quera, Tobias Winterfeld, Carolina Ganss&lt;/p&gt;

We date the emergence of this pathogen to the early 20th century, coinciding with the global expansion of commercial trade in amphibians, and we show that intercontinental transmission is ongoing. Our findings point to East Asia as a geographic hotspot for &lt;i&gt;B. dendrobatidis&lt;/i&gt; biodiversity and the original source of these lineages that now parasitize amphibians worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>892449e0</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/621.full</canonicalUrl><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/621?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>29</engagement><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163820416dc:6443f07:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04402-6</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04402-6</link><author><name>Anastasia Felker</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continuous addition of progenitors forms the cardiac ventricle in zebrafish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous addition of progenitors forms the cardiac ventricle in zebrafish, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04402-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04402-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Late-differentiating second heart field progenitors contribute to atrium, ventricle, and outflow tract in the zebrafish heart but how remains unclear.

These data establish a link between C1q and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell metabolism and may explain how C1q protects against lupus, with implications for the role of viral infections in the perpetuation of autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><keywords><item>Immunology</item></keywords><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/558?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>146</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05254-2/d41586-018-05254-2_15785370.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1639310bcbe:810d041:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05254-2</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05254-2</link><author><name>Elizabeth Gibney</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muons: the little-known particles helping to probe the impenetrable&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muons: the little-known particles helping to probe the impenetrable, Published online: 24 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05254-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05254-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The ubiquitous particles are helping to map the innards of pyramids and volcanoes, and spot missing nuclear waste.</content></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527180737726</crawled><published>1527145200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Muons: the little-known particles helping to probe the impenetrable</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05254-2</href></item></alternate><engagementRate>1.28</engagementRate><fingerprint>7b25ef87</fingerprint><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muons: the little-known particles helping to probe the impenetrable&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muons: the little-known particles helping to probe the impenetrable, Published online: 24 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05254-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05254-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The ubiquitous particles are helping to map the innards of pyramids and volcanoes, and spot missing nuclear waste.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163b0e0c785:265d271:3dd877af</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31879</originId><fingerprint>a0b2077e</fingerprint><author><name>frankel@cgl.ucsf.edu (Alan D Frankel)</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The HIV-1 Tat protein hijacks P-TEFb kinase to activate paused RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) at the viral promoter.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cancer and factor V Leiden mutation are both risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Cancer critically increases the thrombotic risk whereas Factor V Leiden is the most common pro-thrombotic mutation. The impact of the factor V Leiden on the risk of VTE in cancer patients remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the impact of factor V Leiden mutation in cancer-associated thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The EDITH hospital-based case-control study enrolled 182 patients with cancer and VTE as well as 182 control patients with cancer, matched for gender, age and cancer location, between 2000 and 2012, in the University Hospital of Brest. All cases and controls were genotyped for the factor V Leiden mutation and interviewed with a standardized questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty one of 182 (11.5%) patients with cancer-associated thrombosis carried the factor V Leiden mutation and 4 of 182 (2.2%) controls with cancer but no venous thrombosis. In multivariate analysis including cancer stage and family history of VTE, cancer patients with factor V Leiden mutation had a seven-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.04; 95% CI, 2.01–24.63).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The pro-thrombotic Factor V Leiden mutation was found to be an independent additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients and might therefore be considered in the individual thrombotic risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><published>1526677200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Risk of venous thromboembolism in association with factor V leiden in cancer patients – The EDITH case-control study</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194973</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adeline Heraudeau, Aurélien Delluc, Mickaël Le Henaff, Karine Lacut, Christophe Leroyer, Benoit Desrues, Francis Couturaud, Cécile Tromeur&lt;/p&gt;

HIV acquisition during pregnancy and breastfeeding significantly contributes toward paediatric HIV infection; however, little is known about risk behaviours in HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted twenty-six in-depth-interviews between July and December 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide among HIV-uninfected pregnant and recently postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition (defined as reporting ≥1 of the following: partner’s serostatus unknown or HIV-infected, recent condomless sex in pregnancy, and/or alcohol use during pregnancy) who attended primary healthcare services. Our study contextualizes factors related to risky sexual behaviours during pregnancy and postpartum periods and assesses knowledge and hypothetical acceptability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy. Translated and transcribed data were coded and analysed by three researchers using a thematic analysis approach. In interviews with HIV-uninfected pregnant/postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition, we identified common themes associated with sexual risk behaviours during pregnancy, including: lack of control over decisions in sex and condom use in pregnancy, low perceived risk (e.g. beliefs that their partner has the same HIV-negative serostatus), and socio-cultural beliefs around condom use during pregnancy (e.g. contact with sperm is essential for baby’s development).

HIV acquisition during pregnancy and breastfeeding significantly contributes toward paediatric HIV infection; however, little is known about risk behaviours in HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted twenty-six in-depth-interviews between July and December 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide among HIV-uninfected pregnant and recently postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition (defined as reporting ≥1 of the following: partner’s serostatus unknown or HIV-infected, recent condomless sex in pregnancy, and/or alcohol use during pregnancy) who attended primary healthcare services. Our study contextualizes factors related to risky sexual behaviours during pregnancy and postpartum periods and assesses knowledge and hypothetical acceptability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy. Translated and transcribed data were coded and analysed by three researchers using a thematic analysis approach. In interviews with HIV-uninfected pregnant/postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition, we identified common themes associated with sexual risk behaviours during pregnancy, including: lack of control over decisions in sex and condom use in pregnancy, low perceived risk (e.g. beliefs that their partner has the same HIV-negative serostatus), and socio-cultural beliefs around condom use during pregnancy (e.g. contact with sperm is essential for baby’s development). PrEP knowledge was low among HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women, and potential acceptability was good, though primary concerns were around the potential impact on the infant. While mothers presented a clear desire to protect themselves from HIV acquisition once pregnant, they also reported lack of control, and socio-cultural beliefs, like sex is good for the baby, that increased their risk of seroconversion. Mothers had limited PrEP awareness but reported hypothetical willingness to use PrEP because of concerns over HIV acquisition and onward mother to child transmission.</description><fingerprint>1f55ceaf</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197143</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7dd:93d646dc</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-f?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>860fb560</fingerprint><author><name>Zahn, L.

We have developed our original tissue engineering technology “cell sheet engineering” utilizing temperature-responsive culture dishes. The cells are confluently grown on a temperature-responsive culture dish and can be harvested as a cell sheet by lowering temperature without enzymatic digestion. Cell sheets are high-cell-density tissues similar to actual living tissues, maintaining their structure and function. Based on this “cell sheet engineering”, we are trying to create functional cardiac tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells, for regenerative therapy and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing. Toward this purpose, it is necessary to evaluate the contractility of engineered cardiac cell sheets. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a contractile force measurement system and evaluated the contractility of human iPSC-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissues. By attaching the cardiac cell sheets on fibrin gel sheets, we created dynamically beating cardiac cell sheet-tissues. They were mounted to the force measurement system and the contractile force was measured stably and clearly. The absolute values of contractile force were around 1 mN, and the mean force value per cross-sectional area was 3.3 mN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are equivalent to or larger than many previously reported values, indicating the functionality of our engineered cardiac cell sheets. We also confirmed that both the contractile force and beating rate were significantly increased by the administration of adrenaline, which are the physiologically relevant responses for cardiac tissues. In conclusion, the force measurement system developed in the present study is valuable for the evaluation of engineered cardiac cell sheet-tissues, and for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing as well.</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><published>1527109200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Contractile force measurement of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissue</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198026</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daisuke Sasaki, Katsuhisa Matsuura, Hiroyoshi Seta, Yuji Haraguchi, Teruo Okano, Tatsuya Shimizu&lt;/p&gt;

The objectives of this study are to analyze the associations between educational levels and poor self-rated health (SRH) among adults in Brazil and to assess trends in the prevalence of poor self-rated health across educational groups between 1998 and 2013. Individual-level data came from the 1998, 2003 and 2008 Brazilian National Household Survey and the 2013 National Health Survey. We estimate prevalence rates of poor SRH by education. Using multivariable regressions, we assess the associations between educational levels and poor self-rated health. We use these regressions to predict the estimated ratios between the prevalence rates of those in low vs. high education in order to assess if relative changes in poor SRH have narrowed over time. Finally, we tested for statistically significant time trends in adult chronic disease inequalities by education. Results indicate a clear educational gradient in poor SRH. Prevalence ratios show that Brazilian adults with no education have levels of poor SRH that are 7 to 9 times higher than those with some college or more. The difference between those with lowest and highest education increased from 1998 to 2013. Compared to those with no education, there were increases in the prevalence of poor SRH among those with primary and secondary incomplete as well as among those with secondary complete in 2008 and 2013. In conclusion, there is a positive association between poor SRH and low education. Brazil has many social and geographic inequalities in health. Even though educational levels are increasing, there is no improvement in the general subjective health of Brazilians. Health inequalities by race and region highlight the need to improve the health of socially disadvantaged groups in Brazil. Addressing chronic conditions and mental health is needed to improve self-perceptions of health in Brazil as well.</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Increasing educational inequalities in self-rated health in Brazil, 1998-2013</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196494</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Flavia Cristina Drumond Andrade, Jeenal Deepak Mehta&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting C/EBPβ-LIP may offer new possibilities to treat age-related diseases and to prolong healthspan.</description><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item></keywords><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34985</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163b2809226:2a34c02:2835af05</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/146035v3?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>25ba39ed</fingerprint><author><name>DevoWorm Group,</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The relatively new field of connectomics provides us with a unique window into nervous system function.

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular method for measuring transcript abundance. The most commonly used method of interpretation is relative quantification and thus necessitates the use of normalization controls (i.e. reference genes) to standardize transcript abundance. The most popular gene targets for RT-qPCR are housekeeping genes because they are thought to maintain a static transcript level among a variety of samples. However, more recent studies have shown, several housekeeping genes are not reliably stable. This is the first study to examine the potential of several reference genes for use in RT-qPCR normalization during barley malting. The process of malting barley mechanizes the imbibition and subsequent germination of barley seeds under controlled conditions. Malt quality is controlled by many pleiotropic genes that are determined by examining the result of physiological changes the barley seed undergoes during the malting process. We compared the stability of 13 reference genes across both two-and six-row malting barleys (Conrad and Legacy, respectfully) throughout the entirety of the malting process. Initially, primer target specificity, amplification efficiency and average Ct values were determined for each of the selected primer pairs. Three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to rank the stability of each reference gene. Rankings were similar between the two- and six-row with the exception of BestKeeper’s ranking of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;). A consensus ranking among programs was determined using RefFinder. Our results show that Actin (A&lt;i&gt;CT&lt;/i&gt;) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (&lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) were the most stable throughout micromalting, while &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and Cyclophilin (&lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) were the least stable. Two reference genes are necessary for stable transcript normalization according to geNorm and the best two reference genes (&lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) provided a sufficient level of stability.</content></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><published>1525813200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Evaluation and selection of internal reference genes from two- and six-row U.S. malting barley varieties throughout micromalting for use in RT-qPCR</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196966</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jason G.

Testudinid herpesviruses (TeHVs) have a worldwide distribution among tortoises. However, information such as risk factors promoting the occurrence or the recrudescence of the associated disease and the mid-term sequelae of an outbreak comprising the extent and dynamic of the viral shedding have been only minimally investigated. Critical management information is also lacking or anecdotal. Furthermore, major aspects of the viral pathogenesis including the likelihood of vertical transmission of the virus are virtually unknown. The present study describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of &lt;i&gt;Testudinid herpesvirus&lt;/i&gt; genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of chelonians. Clinical, pathological, molecular and serological characterization of the outbreak were carried out. Seventy-five percent of the infected tortoises died. Complementation of molecular and serological testing was a critical point for successful management implementations. A case-control study was performed to analyze possible risk factors associated with the infection. Furthermore, a subgroup of six asymptomatic infected tortoises was monitored for two consecutive seasons after the outbreak: all the infected tortoises were determined to be intermittent shedders, except one, which was a persistent shedder. Post-hibernation was associated with the highest number of shedders. Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus was obtained for the first time.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Clinical, virological and epidemiological characterization of an outbreak of Testudinid Herpesvirus 3 in a chelonian captive breeding facility: Lessons learned and first evidence of TeHV3 vertical transmission</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197169</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Luisa Marenzoni, Lorenzo Santoni, Andrea Felici, Carmen Maresca, Valentina Stefanetti, Monica Sforna, Maria Pia Franciosini, Patrizia Casagrande Proietti, Francesco Carlo Origgi&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus was obtained for the first time.</description><fingerprint>d9a2aea0</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197169</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e22:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197915</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197915</canonicalUrl><author><name>Moris Sangineto</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Moris Sangineto, Giusi Graziano, Simona D’Amore, Roberto Salvia, Giuseppe Palasciano, Carlo Sabbà, Michele Vacca, Marica Cariello&lt;/p&gt;
Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic disorder characterized by an immune-mediated reaction to gluten and a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Currently, the main treatment of CD is represented by adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which determines the resolution of symptoms, and the normalization of the serology and of the duodenal villous atrophy. In the present study, we aimed to identify changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of celiac patients on GFD for at least 2 years, in order to identify novel disease biomarkers and candidate targets for putative therapeutic approaches. Microarray analysis was performed on PBMCs from 17 celiac patients on long-term GFD and 20 healthy controls. We identified 517 annotated genes that were significantly modulated between celiac patients and controls. Significant biological pathways were functionally clustered using the Core Function of Ingenuity System Pathway Analysis (IPA). Intriguingly, despite being on a GFD, celiac patients exhibited a peculiar PBMC profile characterized by an aberrant expression of genes involved in the regulation of immunity, inflammatory response, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Random forest algorithm was then used to validate the prediction ability of core genes as classifiers of the “celiac status”. In conclusion, our study identified a characteristic PBMCs signature profile in clinically asymptomatic celiac patient.</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Identification of peculiar gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of celiac patients on gluten free diet</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197915</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Moris Sangineto, Giusi Graziano, Simona D’Amore, Roberto Salvia, Giuseppe Palasciano, Carlo Sabbà, Michele Vacca, Marica Cariello&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;In two concurrent studies, we aimed to a) confirm the acute effect of 0.3 g·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight (BW) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) supplementation on central and peripheral mechanisms associated with explosive power (Study 1) and b) determine whether chronic NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation would improve the adaptive response of the neuromuscular system during a 10-week resistance training program (Study 2).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight resistance trained participants volunteered after providing written consent. The experimental design consisted of a week of baseline testing, followed by ten weeks of training with progress measures performed in Week 5. Study 1 involved neuromuscular measurements before and after the leg extension portion of a power based training session performed in Week 1. Changes in maximal torque (MVT) and rates of torque development (RTD), along with other variables derived from femoral nerve stimulation (e.g. voluntary activation, neural recruitment) were analysed to determine the extent of fatigue under NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or placebo conditions. Changes in these same variables, coupled with functional 1-repetition maximum leg extension strength, were measured in Study 2 from baseline (Week 0) to Week 5, and again at Week 10.&lt;/p&gt; Results and conclusion &lt;p&gt;In Study 1, we observed a decline after the leg extension task in both MVT (~ 30%) and rates of torque production (RTD) irrespective of acid-base status, however the decline in maximal RTD (RTD&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;) was nearly 20% less in the NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; condition when compared to placebo (mean difference of 294.8 ± 133.4 Nm·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (95% CI -583.1 to -6.5 Nm, p &amp;lt; 0.05)). The primary finding in Study 2, however, suggests that introducing NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; repeatedly during a 10-week RT program does not confer any additional benefit to the mechanisms (and subsequent adaptive processes) related to explosive power production.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><published>1525294800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Acute attenuation of fatigue after sodium bicarbonate supplementation does not manifest into greater training adaptations after 10-weeks of resistance training exercise</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196677</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jason C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Integrin α8 (ITGA8) heterodimerizes with integrin β1 and is highly expressed in stromal cells of the lung. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ+) cells constitute a major population of contractile myofibroblasts in the lung following bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Integrin α8β1 is upregulated in fibrotic foci in bleomycin-induced lung injury. However, the functional role of ITGA8 in fibrogenesis has not been characterized. In this study, we examined whether genetic deletion of ITGA8 from PDGFRβ+ cells in the lung altered fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pdgfrb-Cre/+;&lt;i&gt;Itga8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/-&lt;/sup&gt; or Pdgfrb-Cre/+;&lt;i&gt;Itga8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt; (Cre+) and control mice (Cre-) were used for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.

However, Cre- and Cre+ animals showed no significant difference in measures of acute lung injury or fibrosis following bleomycin challenge.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;While ITGA8 deletion in lung PDGFRβ+ stromal cells showed evidence of greater &lt;i&gt;Col1a1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression after TGFβ treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, no functional difference was detected &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>1fdab7cf</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197937</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f80:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197340</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197340</canonicalUrl><author><name>Naveed Ahmad</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naveed Ahmad, M.

Characterisation and thermal deterioration of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk is presented for the first time using the potential of Fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission bands in non-heated desi ghee centred at 375 nm is labelled for vitamin D, 390 nm for vitamin K, 440–460 nm for isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), 490 nm for vitamin A and the region 620–700 nm is assigned to chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission spectra from all the heated and non-heated ghee samples were recorded using excitation wavelengths at 280, and 410 nm which were found best for getting maximum spectral signatures. Heating of desi ghee affects its molecular composition, however, the temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be defined safe for cooking /frying where it does not lose much of its molecular composition. Further, the rise in temperature induces prominent spectral variations which confirm the deterioration of valuable vitamins, isomers of CLA and chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission peak at 552 nm shows oxidation product and an increase in its intensity with the rise in temperature is observed. In order to classify heated samples at different temperatures, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on heated and non-heated ghee samples that further elucidated the temperature effects.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><published>1526072400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Studying heating effects on desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk using fluorescence spectroscopy</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197340</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naveed Ahmad, M.

&lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; is a cell-cycle regulator. &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; has been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, but few researchers have studied &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; in shrimps. We cloned &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; from the black tiger shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Penaeus monodon&lt;/i&gt;). The full-length cDNA sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. The lowest &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression was noted in stage III of ovarian development in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression decreased significantly after injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and eyestalk ablation in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; ovaries.

Success rates for catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation patients are currently low; however, there is a subset of patients for whom electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins alone is a successful treatment strategy. It is difficult to identify these patients because there are a multitude of factors affecting arrhythmia susceptibility and maintenance, and the individual contributions of these factors are difficult to determine clinically. We hypothesised that the combination of pulmonary vein (PV) electrophysiology and atrial body fibrosis determine driver location and effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We used bilayer biatrial computer models based on patient geometries to investigate the effects of PV properties and atrial fibrosis on arrhythmia inducibility, maintenance mechanisms, and the outcome of PVI. Short PV action potential duration (APD) increased arrhythmia susceptibility, while longer PV APD was found to be protective. Arrhythmia inducibility increased with slower conduction velocity (CV) at the LA/PV junction, but not for cases with homogeneous CV changes or slower CV at the distal PV. Phase singularity (PS) density in the PV region for cases with PV fibrosis was increased. Arrhythmia dynamics depend on both PV properties and fibrosis distribution, varying from meandering rotors to PV reentry (in cases with baseline or long APD), to stable rotors at regions of high fibrosis density. Measurement of fibrosis and PV properties may indicate patient specific susceptibility to AF initiation and maintenance. PV PS density before PVI was higher for cases in which AF terminated or converted to a macroreentry; thus, high PV PS density may indicate likelihood of PVI success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rn0Tfj7bu6A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527184669816</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rn0Tfj7bu6A/article</href></item></alternate><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Variability in pulmonary vein electrophysiology and fibrosis determines arrhythmia susceptibility and dynamics</title><recrawled>1527194529092</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Caroline H.

In the 5‐step carboxylase reaction, the substrate Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP) first binds Rubisco and undergoes enolization before binding the second substrate, CO2. Hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex is followed by CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation. However, details of the roles and protonation states of active‐site residues, and sources of protons and water, remain highly speculative. Large‐scale computations on active‐site models provide a means to better understand this complex chemical mechanism. The computational protocol comprises a combination of hybrid semi‐empirical quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics within constrained molecular dynamics simulations, together with constrained gradient minimization calculations using density functional theory. Alternative pathways for hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex and associated active‐site protonation networks and proton and water sources were investigated. The main findings from analysis of the resulting energetics advocate major revision to existing mechanisms such that: hydration takes place anti to the CO2; both hydration and CC bond scission require early protonation of CO2 in the RuBP.CO2 complex; CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation reactions are concerted and, effectively, there is only one stable intermediate, the C3‐gemdiolate complex. Our main conclusions for interpreting enzyme kinetic results are that the gemdiolate may represent the elusive Michaelis–Menten‐like complex corresponding to the empirical Km (=Kc) with turnover to product via bond scission concerted with stereospecific protonation consistent with the observed catalytic rate. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><crawled>1526330805274</crawled><published>1526281661000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Revised mechanism of carboxylation of ribulose‐1,5‐biphosphate by rubisco from large scale quantum chemical calculations</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25343?af=R</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>60a40e84</fingerprint><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><description>Here, we describe a computational approach for studying enzymes that catalyze complex multi‐step reactions and apply it to Ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme that fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide within photosynthesis.

Thus, we identified a regulatory pathway involving nuclear PTEN–mediated miRNA generation that limits the production of MyD88 and thereby limits sepsis-associated mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/528/eaai9085.full</canonicalUrl><origin><title>Science Signaling current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/528/eaai9085?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163a5aab38d:1587651:3dd877af</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025720?af=R</originId><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025720?af=R</link><author><name>Douglas J.

Aim &lt;p&gt;To determine choroidal thickness in healthy Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study; healthy Indian subjects (n = 230) with no history of ocular and/or systemic disorders were enrolled in the study. Choroidal thickness was measured for 230 eyes using SS-OCT. Subjects were divided into six age groups. Main outcome measures were subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular choroidal thickness (MCT) up to 3 mm at 500-micron interval from the fovea was measured in eight different quadrants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean SFCT was 307±79 μm and mean MCT was 285±75 μm. No difference in the choroidal thickness was found among genders. Mean SFCT of the different age groups was 327±68 μm (12–18 years), 364±70 μm (18.1–30 years), 321±78 μm (30.1–40 years), 304±79 μm (40.1–50 years), 283±69 μm (50.1–60 years) and 262±72μm (above 60 years; p &amp;lt;0.001; One way ANOVA). Mean macular choroidal thickness was 305±60 μm, 342±61 μm, 306±72 μm, 282±79 μm, 261±66 μm, 238±68μm respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001; one way ANOVA). A significant weak negative correlation was found between age with SFCT (r = -0.368, p&amp;lt;0.001) and MCT (r = -0.40, p&amp;lt;0.001).

Ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest and especially during sleep, suggesting that changes in the autonomic modulation may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher &lt;i&gt;HF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;nu&lt;/sub&gt; values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (&lt;i&gt;AUC&lt;/i&gt; = 0.92 ± 0.01; &lt;i&gt;Se&lt;/i&gt; = 0.91 ± 0.06; &lt;i&gt;Sp&lt;/i&gt; = 0.90 ± 0.05).

Therefore, based on these findings, some of the analyzed HRV markers and the proposed model could be useful for risk stratification in Brugada syndrome.</description><fingerprint>b94cb53c</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197367</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16339790828:2611d99:3dd877af</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5036928?af=R</originId><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5036928?af=R</link><author><name>Derrick Ampadu Boateng</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1525677623336</crawled><published>1525232217000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Erratum: “Dissociation dynamics of 3- and 4-nitrotoluene radical cations: Coherently driven C–NO2 bond homolysis” [J.

Regulating membrane potential and synaptic function contributes significantly to the energetic costs of brain signaling, but the relative costs of action potentials (APs) and synaptic transmission during high-frequency firing are unknown. The continuous high-frequency (200-600Hz) electric organ discharge (EOD) of &lt;i&gt;Eigenmannia&lt;/i&gt;, a weakly electric fish, underlies its electrosensing and communication. EODs reflect APs fired by the muscle-derived electrocytes of the electric organ (EO). Cholinergic synapses at the excitable posterior membranes of the elongated electrocytes control AP frequency. Based on whole-fish O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption, ATP demand per EOD-linked AP increases exponentially with AP frequency. Continual EOD-AP generation implies first, that ion homeostatic processes reliably counteract any dissipation of posterior membrane E&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; and second that high frequency synaptic activation is reliably supported. Both of these processes require energy. To facilitate an exploration of the expected energy demands of each, we modify a previous excitability model and include synaptic currents able to drive APs at frequencies as high as 600 Hz. Synaptic stimuli are modeled as pulsatile cation conductance changes, with or without a small (sustained) background conductance. Over the full species range of EOD frequencies (200–600 Hz) we calculate frequency-dependent “Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-entry budgets” for an electrocyte AP as a surrogate for required 3Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/2K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase activity. We find that the cost per AP of maintaining constant-amplitude APs increases nonlinearly with frequency, whereas the cost per AP for synaptic input current is essentially constant. This predicts that Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel density should correlate positively with EOD frequency, whereas AChR density should be the same across fish. Importantly, calculated costs (inferred from Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-entry through Nav and ACh channels) for electrocyte APs as frequencies rise are much less than expected from published whole-fish EOD-linked O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption. For APs at increasingly high frequencies, we suggest that EOD-related costs external to electrocytes (including packaging of synaptic transmitter) substantially exceed the direct cost of electrocyte ion homeostasis.</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A model for studying the energetics of sustained high frequency firing</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196508</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bela Joos, Michael R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Paritaprevir inhibits organic anion–transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, which transport bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinemia is an adverse event reported during hepatitis C treatment. Gadoxetic acid is also transported by OATP1B1/1B3. We evaluated whether the enhancement effect in gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could predict the plasma concentration of paritaprevir and might anticipate the development of hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective study evaluated 27 patients with hepatitis C who underwent gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging prior to treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir. The contrast enhancement index (CEI), a measure of liver enhancement during the hepatobiliary phase, was assessed. Plasma trough concentrations, and concentrations at 2, 4, and 6 h after dosing were determined 7 d after the start of treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven patients (26%) developed hyperbilirubinemia (≥ 1.6 mg/dl). Paritaprevir trough concentration (C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt;) was significantly higher in patients with hyperbilirubinemia than in those without (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022). We found an inverse relationship between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; (r = 0.612, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), while there was not a significantly weak inverse relationship between AUC&lt;sub&gt;0–6 h&lt;/sub&gt; and CEI (r = −0.338, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.085). The partial correlation coefficient between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; was −0.425 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034), while excluding the effects of albumin and the FIB-4 index. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the CEI was relatively accurate in predicting hyperbilirubinemia, with area under the ROC of 0.882. Multivariate analysis showed that the CEI &amp;lt; 1.61 was the only independent predictor related to the development of hyperbilirubinemia, with an odds ratio of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 1.05–78.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hepatic enhancement with gadoxetic acid was independently related to paritaprevir concentration and was an independent pretreatment factor in predicting hyperbilirubinemia. Gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging can therefore be useful in determining the risk of paritaprevir-induced hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to predict paritaprevir-induced hyperbilirubinemia during treatment of hepatitis C</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196747</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hironao Okubo, Hitoshi Ando, Yushi Sorin, Eisuke Nakadera, Hiroo Fukada, Junichi Morishige, Akihisa Miyazaki, Kenichi Ikejima&lt;/p&gt;

We evaluated whether the enhancement effect in gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could predict the plasma concentration of paritaprevir and might anticipate the development of hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective study evaluated 27 patients with hepatitis C who underwent gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging prior to treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir. The contrast enhancement index (CEI), a measure of liver enhancement during the hepatobiliary phase, was assessed. Plasma trough concentrations, and concentrations at 2, 4, and 6 h after dosing were determined 7 d after the start of treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven patients (26%) developed hyperbilirubinemia (≥ 1.6 mg/dl). Paritaprevir trough concentration (C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt;) was significantly higher in patients with hyperbilirubinemia than in those without (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022). We found an inverse relationship between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; (r = 0.612, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), while there was not a significantly weak inverse relationship between AUC&lt;sub&gt;0–6 h&lt;/sub&gt; and CEI (r = −0.338, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.085). The partial correlation coefficient between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; was −0.425 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034), while excluding the effects of albumin and the FIB-4 index. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the CEI was relatively accurate in predicting hyperbilirubinemia, with area under the ROC of 0.882. Multivariate analysis showed that the CEI &amp;lt; 1.61 was the only independent predictor related to the development of hyperbilirubinemia, with an odds ratio of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 1.05–78.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hepatic enhancement with gadoxetic acid was independently related to paritaprevir concentration and was an independent pretreatment factor in predicting hyperbilirubinemia. Gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging can therefore be useful in determining the risk of paritaprevir-induced hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><fingerprint>701eb9f7</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196747</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e51:fc1f8953</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196574</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196574</canonicalUrl><author><name>Manuel Muñoz</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Manuel Muñoz, Berta Ausín, Ana B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorders (AUD) in older people have been the subject of increasing interest in Europe and worldwide. However, thus far, no reliable data exist regarding the prevalence of AUD in people over the age of 65 years in Europe.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the current (past month), 12-month and lifetime prevalence of alcohol use, abuse and dependence in people aged 65–84 years.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;The MentDis_ICF65+ study was a representative stepwise cross-sectional survey that was conducted in six European and associated cities (Hamburg, Germany; Ferrara, Italy; London/Canterbury, England; Madrid, Spain; Geneva, Switzerland and Jerusalem, Israel).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;In total, 3,142 community-dwelling people aged between 65 and 84 years who lived in participating cities were assessed with an age-sensitive diagnostic interview (CIDI65+).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of lifetime alcohol use was 81% for the overall sample. The observed AUD (DSM-IV-TR) prevalence was as follows: current, 1.1%; 12-month, 5.3% and lifetime, 8.8%. Alcohol consumption and AUD were more prevalent in males, and a significant interaction between gender and city was observed; greater gender differences in the prevalence of these disorders were observed in Hamburg, London/Canterbury and Geneva in comparison to the other cities. The prevalence of lifetime alcohol consumption and 12-month AUD tended to be lower in older persons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results highlight the appropriateness of using age-adjusted diagnostic tools (CIDI65+) to identify alcohol use and AUD in older people. Different alcohol use patterns were observed in males and females. The results seem to indicate the presence of different alcohol use patterns between northern and southern European countries. Specialized services are proposed, including brief and/or more intensive interventions framed intensive and more simple interventions framed in stepped care strategies, to improve the social and health resources available for older people across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Alcohol use, abuse and dependence in an older European population: Results from the MentDis_ICF65+ study</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196574</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Manuel Muñoz, Berta Ausín, Ana B.

Primary brain microvessels (BrMV) maintain the cellular characters and molecular signatures as displayed in vivo, and serve as a vital tool for biomedical research of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the development/optimization of brain drug delivery. The variations of relative purities or cellular composition among different BrMV samples may have significant consequences in data interpretation and research outcome, especially for experiments with high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable reference gene (RG) for accurate normalization of real-time RT-qPCR analysis, and determine the proper marker genes (MG) for relative purity assessment in BrMV samples. Out of five housekeeping genes, β-actin was selected as the most suitable RG that was validated by quantifying mRNA levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in BrMV isolated from mice with one or two expressing alleles. Four marker genes highly/selectively expressed in BBB-forming capillary endothelial cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR for purity assessment, resulting in &lt;i&gt;Cldn&lt;/i&gt;5 and &lt;i&gt;Pecam1&lt;/i&gt; as most suitable MGs that were further confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis of cellular components. &lt;i&gt;Plvap&lt;/i&gt; proved to be an indicator gene for the presence of fenestrated vessels in BrMV samples.

The purple sea urchin, &lt;i&gt;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&lt;/i&gt;, has a complex and robust immune system that is mediated by a number of multi-gene families including the &lt;i&gt;SpTransformer&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt;) gene family (formerly &lt;i&gt;Sp185/333&lt;/i&gt;). In response to immune challenge from bacteria and various pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the &lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt; genes are up-regulated in sea urchin phagocytes and express a diverse array of SpTrf proteins. We show here that SpTrf proteins from coelomocytes and isolated by nickel affinity (cNi-SpTrf) bind to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and to Baker’s yeast, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, with saturable kinetics and specificity. cNi-SpTrf opsonization of the marine bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Vibrio diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt;, augments phagocytosis, however, opsonization by the recombinant protein, rSpTrf-E1, does not. Binding by cNi-SpTrf proteins retards growth rates significantly for several species of bacteria. SpTrf proteins, previously thought to be strictly membrane-associated, are secreted from phagocytes in short term cultures and bind &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt; that are located both outside of and within phagocytes. Our results demonstrate anti-microbial activities of native SpTrf proteins and suggest variable functions among different SpTrf isoforms.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The pathogenic role of the lysophospholipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate and its receptor S1PR2 in lung fibrosis is unknown. We show here that genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; strikingly attenuated lung fibrosis induced by repeated injections of bleomycin in mice. We observed by using &lt;i&gt;S1pr&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice that S1PR2 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells in the lung and that S1PR2-expressing cells accumulated in the fibrotic legions. Bone marrow chimera experiments suggested that S1PR2 in bone marrow–derived cells contributes to the development of lung fibrosis. Depletion of macrophages greatly attenuated lung fibrosis. Bleomycin administration stimulated the mRNA expression of the profibrotic cytokines IL-13 and IL-4 and the M2 markers including arginase 1, Fizz1/&lt;i&gt;Retnla&lt;/i&gt;, Ccl17 and Ccl24 in cells collected from broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), and &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; deletion markedly diminished the stimulated expression of these genes. BALF cells from bleomycin–administered wild-type mice showed a marked increase in phosphorylation of STAT6, a transcription factor which is activated downstream of IL-13, compared with saline–administered wild-type mice.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The pathogenic role of the lysophospholipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate and its receptor S1PR2 in lung fibrosis is unknown. We show here that genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; strikingly attenuated lung fibrosis induced by repeated injections of bleomycin in mice. We observed by using &lt;i&gt;S1pr&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice that S1PR2 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells in the lung and that S1PR2-expressing cells accumulated in the fibrotic legions. Bone marrow chimera experiments suggested that S1PR2 in bone marrow–derived cells contributes to the development of lung fibrosis. Depletion of macrophages greatly attenuated lung fibrosis. Bleomycin administration stimulated the mRNA expression of the profibrotic cytokines IL-13 and IL-4 and the M2 markers including arginase 1, Fizz1/&lt;i&gt;Retnla&lt;/i&gt;, Ccl17 and Ccl24 in cells collected from broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), and &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; deletion markedly diminished the stimulated expression of these genes. BALF cells from bleomycin–administered wild-type mice showed a marked increase in phosphorylation of STAT6, a transcription factor which is activated downstream of IL-13, compared with saline–administered wild-type mice. Interestingly, in bleomycin–administered &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, STAT6 phosphorylation in BALF cells was substantially diminished compared with wild-type mice. Finally, pharmacological S1PR2 blockade in &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice alleviated bleomycin–induced lung fibrosis. Thus, S1PR2 facilitates lung fibrosis through the mechanisms involving augmentation of IL-13 expression and its signaling in BALF cells, and represents a novel target for treating lung fibrosis.</description><fingerprint>33641c1d</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197604</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce93e:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/871-c?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/871.3.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Kiberstis, P.

&lt;i&gt;Grapevine Pinot gris virus&lt;/i&gt; (GPGV) is a widely distributed grapevine pathogen that has been associated to the grapevine leaf mottling and deformation disease. With the aim of better understanding the disease epidemiology and providing efficient control strategies a specific and quantitative duplex TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay has been developed. This method has allowed reliable quantitation of the GPGV titer ranging from 30 up to 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; transcript copies, with a detection limit of 70 viral copies in plant material. The assay targets a grapevine internal control that reduces the occurrence of false negative results, thus increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of the technique. Viral isolates both associated and non-associated to symptoms from Greece, Slovakia and Spain have been successfully detected. The method has also been applied to the absolute quantitation of GPGV in its putative transmission vector &lt;i&gt;Colomerus vitis&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the viral titer present in single mites has been determined. In addition, in the current study a new polymorphism in the GPGV genome responsible for a shorter movement protein has been found. A phylogenetic study based on this genomic region has shown a high variability among Spanish isolates and points to a different evolutionary origin of this new polymorphism. The methodology here developed opens new possibilities for basic and epidemiological studies as well as for the establishment of efficient control strategies.</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><published>1526418000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>A novel specific duplex real-time RT-PCR method for absolute quantitation of &amp;lt;i&gt;Grapevine Pinot gris virus&amp;lt;/i&gt; in plant material and single mites</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197237</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Félix Morán, Antonio Olmos, Leonidas Lotos, Lukáš Predajňa, Nikolaos Katis, Miroslav Glasa, Varvara Maliogka, Ana B.

The method has also been applied to the absolute quantitation of GPGV in its putative transmission vector &lt;i&gt;Colomerus vitis&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the viral titer present in single mites has been determined. In addition, in the current study a new polymorphism in the GPGV genome responsible for a shorter movement protein has been found. A phylogenetic study based on this genomic region has shown a high variability among Spanish isolates and points to a different evolutionary origin of this new polymorphism. The methodology here developed opens new possibilities for basic and epidemiological studies as well as for the establishment of efficient control strategies.</description><fingerprint>90d694f2</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197237</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1636320fcdf:3602ebd:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04294-6</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04294-6</link><author><name>Cheng Chen</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Functionalized boron nitride membranes with ultrafast solvent transport performance for molecular separation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functionalized boron nitride membranes with ultrafast solvent transport performance for molecular separation, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04294-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04294-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;2D materials show promise for membrane filtration technologies, but their permeance to organic solvents is typically poor.

V.</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Cellular signalling involves networks of small, interacting molecular populations and requires precise event timing, despite the presence of noise. The Poisson channel is an important communication model for such noisy interactions, providing a fundamental link between timing precision, information transfer and the rate of signalling. Constraints on this rate limit the Poisson channel capacity, which in turn bounds the precision with which molecular networks can solve estimation problems. We investigate these bounds as a function of signalling rate constraints, for problems in which information about a target molecular species, to be estimated, is encoded in the birth rate of a signalling species. Birth-following is a known heuristic encoder that asserts the maximum signalling rate until every target birth is recorded, then deactivates. Here we derive birth-following as a minimum time signalling (bang-bang) code, and prove that it outperforms these precision bounds for general target birth rate functions over arbitrary signalling network architectures. The simplest of these networks commonly models the dynamics of long-lived proteins. Birth-following is therefore an important reference strategy when the maximum signalling rate is high and the mean rate is no smaller than that of the target molecule. Discreteness is important in this regime. We examine the limit of this regime by removing the maximum signalling constraint. This leads to a Poisson channel with infinite capacity, which should allow completely precise timing. However, we find perfect estimation unrealisable unless the mean condition is maintained.

The Poisson channel is an important communication model for such noisy interactions, providing a fundamental link between timing precision, information transfer and the rate of signalling. Constraints on this rate limit the Poisson channel capacity, which in turn bounds the precision with which molecular networks can solve estimation problems. We investigate these bounds as a function of signalling rate constraints, for problems in which information about a target molecular species, to be estimated, is encoded in the birth rate of a signalling species. Birth-following is a known heuristic encoder that asserts the maximum signalling rate until every target birth is recorded, then deactivates. Here we derive birth-following as a minimum time signalling (bang-bang) code, and prove that it outperforms these precision bounds for general target birth rate functions over arbitrary signalling network architectures. The simplest of these networks commonly models the dynamics of long-lived proteins. Birth-following is therefore an important reference strategy when the maximum signalling rate is high and the mean rate is no smaller than that of the target molecule. Discreteness is important in this regime. We examine the limit of this regime by removing the maximum signalling constraint. This leads to a Poisson channel with infinite capacity, which should allow completely precise timing. However, we find perfect estimation unrealisable unless the mean condition is maintained. The relationship between estimation and information is therefore not as simple or intuitive as in analogous problems on Gaussian channels. Higher Poisson capacities do not always imply better precision and realisable performance is more dependent on finding suitable encoders that capitalise on the information structure of the signalling problem of interest. There is a need for new information-theoretic metrics that can better account for both the gap between achievable and theoretical precision, and the idiosyncrasies of the Poisson channel.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/13/319889</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319889v1?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-chemrxiv-7984736271254/11294447/thumb.png</url><height>354</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><width>250</width></visual><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163210d49c5:4936b2:93d646dc</id><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/A_New_Adsorption_Rate_Equation_in_Batch_Systems/6209984</originId><fingerprint>34910f6</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>In

Multicellular spheroids generated through cellular self-assembly provide cytoarchitectural complexities of native tissue including three-dimensionality, extensive cell-cell contacts, and appropriate cell-extracellular matrix interactions. They are increasingly suggested as building blocks for larger engineered tissues to achieve shapes, organization, heterogeneity, and other biomimetic complexities. Application of these tissue culture platforms is of particular importance in cardiac research as the myocardium is comprised of distinct but intermingled cell types. Here, we generated scaffold-free 3D cardiac microtissue spheroids comprised of cardiac myocytes (CMs) and/or cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and used them as building blocks to form larger microtissues with different spatial distributions of CMs and CFs. Characterization of fusing homotypic and heterotypic spheroid pairs revealed an important influence of CFs on fusion kinetics, but most strikingly showed rapid fusion kinetics between heterotypic pairs consisting of one CF and one CM spheroid, indicating that CMs and CFs self-sort &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into the intermixed morphology found in the healthy myocardium. We then examined electrophysiological integration of fused homotypic and heterotypic microtissues by mapping action potential propagation. Heterocellular elongated microtissues which recapitulate the disproportionate CF spatial distribution seen in the infarcted myocardium showed that action potentials propagate through CF volumes albeit with significant delay. Complementary computational modeling revealed an important role of CF sodium currents and the spatial distribution of the CM-CF boundary in action potential conduction through CF volumes. Taken together, this study provides useful insights for the development of complex, heterocellular engineered 3D tissue constructs and their engraftment via tissue fusion and has implications for arrhythmogenesis in cardiac disease and repair.</content></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><published>1525208400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Directed fusion of cardiac spheroids into larger heterocellular microtissues enables investigation of cardiac action potential propagation via cardiac fibroblasts</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196714</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tae Yun Kim, Celinda M.

The results were verified using Sanger sequencing data for the same dataset in a supporting publication.NeST offers a user-friendly pipeline for variant calling with standardized outputs and minimal computational demands for easy deployment for use with various organisms and applications.</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/21/323535</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323535v3?rss=1</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8f:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197442</originId><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197442</canonicalUrl><author><name>Xueshui Guo</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xueshui Guo, Natalia A.

The Hedgehog family of morphogens has long been known to utilize, through the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), the heterotrimeric G protein G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in both canonical and noncanonical forms of signaling. Other G proteins, while not specifically utilized by Smo, may nonetheless provide access to some of the events controlled by it. We reported several years ago that the G protein G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; activates one or more forms of the Gli family of transcription factors. While the Gli transcription factors are well known targets for Smo, the uncertain mechanism of activation by G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and the identity of the targeted Gli(s) limited predictions as to the extent to which G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; might mimic Smo’s actions. We evaluate here the potential for overlap in G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and Smo signaling using C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells as models of osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We find in C3H10T1/2 cells that a constitutively active form of Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL) increases Gli1 mRNA, as does a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoA1). We find as well that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL induces alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenesis, albeit the induction is far less substantial than that achieved by SmoA1. In 3T3-L1 cells both Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 markedly suppress adipogenic differentiation as determined by triglyceride accumulation. RNA sequencing reveals that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 regulate many of the same genes but that quantitative and qualitative differences exist. Differences also exist, we find, between SmoA1 and purmorphamine, an agonist for Smo. Therefore, while comparisons of constitutively active proteins are informative, extrapolations to the setting of agonists require care.</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><published>1526418000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Overlap in signaling between Smoothened and the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G&amp;lt;sub&gt;13&amp;lt;/sub&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197442</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xueshui Guo, Natalia A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Young breast cancer survivors in Mexico face distinct psychosocial challenges that have not been characterized. This study aims to describe the psychosocial needs of young breast cancer survivors in Mexico at 5 or more years of survivorship, identifying areas of focus for early interventions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Breast cancer patients diagnosed at age 40 or prior with 5 or more years since diagnosis were invited to participate in one-on-one 30–60 minute semi-structured audio-recorded interviews at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología in Mexico City. Transcripts were coded using thematic analysis with NVivo software.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;25 women participated. Five major phenomena emerged from analysis: (1) minimization of fertility concerns; (2) persistence of body image disturbance over time; (3) barriers to employment during survivorship; (4) impact on family relationships and social networks; &amp;amp; (5) unmet psychological care and informational needs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Early interventions with a focus on fertility loss education, access to reconstructive surgery and body image support, guidance during return-to-work, assistance with childcare, integration of psychological care and the fulfillment of informational needs could ameliorate long-term psychological and social distress for young breast cancer survivors in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527022800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><published>1527022800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Psychosocial needs of young breast cancer survivors in Mexico City, Mexico</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197931</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Harper G.

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß.

Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours.

They also regulate immune responses and the size of blood cells. Activation of SK channels requires calmodulin (CaM), but how CaM binds and opens SK channels has been unclear. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a human SK4-CaM channel complex in closed and activated states at 3.4- and 3.5-angstrom resolution, respectively. Four CaM molecules bind to one channel tetramer.

They also regulate immune responses and the size of blood cells. Activation of SK channels requires calmodulin (CaM), but how CaM binds and opens SK channels has been unclear. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a human SK4-CaM channel complex in closed and activated states at 3.4- and 3.5-angstrom resolution, respectively. Four CaM molecules bind to one channel tetramer.

Although performance feedback is widely employed as a means to improve motivation, the efficacy and reliability of performance feedback is often obscured by individual differences and situational variables. The joint role of these moderating variables remains unknown. Accordingly, we investigate how the motivational impact of feedback is moderated by personality and task-difficulty. Utilizing three samples (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 916), we explore how Big Five personality traits moderate the motivational impact of false positive and negative feedback on playful, neutral, and frustrating puzzle tasks, respectively. Conscientious and Neurotic individuals together appear particularly sensitive to task difficulty, becoming significantly more motivated by negative feedback on playful tasks and demotivated by negative feedback on frustrating tasks. Results are discussed in terms of Goal-Setting and Self Determination Theory.

Genome-scale metabolic models have become the tool of choice for the global analysis of microorganism metabolism, and their reconstruction has attained high standards of quality and reliability. Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “à la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV3GF0mvv-g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527098195054</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/oV3GF0mvv-g/article</href></item></alternate><published>1527109200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Traceability, reproducibility and wiki-exploration for “à-la-carte” reconstructions of genome-scale metabolic models</title><recrawled>1527108127143</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Méziane Aite, Marie Chevallier, Clémence Frioux, Camille Trottier, Jeanne Got, María Paz Cortés, Sebastián N.

For about 70 years, L-glucose had been considered non-metabolizable by either mammalian or bacterial cells. Recently, however, an L-glucose catabolic pathway has been discovered in &lt;i&gt;Paracoccus laeviglucosivorans&lt;/i&gt;, and the genes responsible cloned. &lt;i&gt;Scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase is involved in the first step in the pathway that oxidizes L-glucose to produce L-glucono-1,5-lactone with concomitant reduction of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent manner. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex of &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and L-glucono-1,5-lactone at 1.8 Å resolution. The enzyme adopts a homo-tetrameric structure, similar to those of the inositol dehydrogenase family, and the electron densities of the bound sugar was clearly observed, allowing identification of the residues responsible for interaction with the substrate in the catalytic site. In addition to the conserved catalytic residues (Lys106, Asp191, and His195), another residue, His318, located in the loop region of the adjacent subunit, is involved in substrate recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of these residues in catalytic activity. We also report the complex structures of the enzyme with &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol and &lt;i&gt;scyllo&lt;/i&gt;-inosose. The Arg178 residue located in the flexible loop at the entrance of the catalytic site is also involved in substrate recognition, and plays an important role in accepting both L-glucose and inositols as substrates. On the basis of these structural features, which have not been identified in the known inositol dehydrogenases, and a phylogenetic analysis of IDH family enzymes, we suggest a novel subfamily of the GFO/IDH/MocA family. Since many enzymes in this family have not biochemically characterized, our results could promote to find their activities with various substrates.</content></content><updated>1527282000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><published>1527282000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Structural basis of L-glucose oxidation by &amp;lt;i&gt;scyllo&amp;lt;/i&gt;-inositol dehydrogenase: Implications for a novel enzyme subfamily classification</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198010</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazuhiro Fukano, Kunio Ozawa, Masaya Kokubu, Tetsu Shimizu, Shinsaku Ito, Yasuyuki Sasaki, Akira Nakamura, Shunsuke Yajima&lt;/p&gt;

Wild bees are essential pollinators whose survival partly depends on the capacity of their environment to offer a sufficient amount of nectar and pollen. Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, &lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&lt;/i&gt;, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.</content></content><updated>1527022800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><published>1527022800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Current and previous spatial distributions of oilseed rape fields influence the abundance and the body size of a solitary wild bee, &amp;lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&amp;lt;/i&gt;, in permanent grasslands</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197684</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Colin Van Reeth, Gaël Caro, Christian Bockstaller, Nadia Michel&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;We sought to develop a novel risk assessment tool to predict the clinical outcomes after heat-related illness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Prospective, multicenter observational study. Patients who transferred to emergency hospitals in Japan with heat-related illness were registered. The sample was divided into two parts: 60% to construct the score and 40% to validate it. A binary logistic regression model was used to predict hospital admission as a primary outcome. The resulting model was transformed into a scoring system.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,001 eligible patients were analyzed. There was no difference in variables between development and validation cohorts. Based on the result of a logistic regression model in the development phase (n = 1,805), the J-ERATO score was defined as the sum of the six binary components in the prehospital setting (respiratory rate≥22 /min, Glasgow coma scale&amp;lt;15, systolic blood pressure≤100 mmHg, heart rate≥100 bpm, body temperature≥38°C, and age≥65 y), for a total score ranging from 0 to 6. In the validation phase (n = 1,196), the score had excellent discrimination (C-statistic 0.84; 95% CI 0.79–0.89, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and calibration (P&gt;0.2 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The observed proportion of hospital admission increased with increasing J-ERATO score (score = 0, 5.0%; score = 1, 15.0%; score = 2, 24.6%; score = 3, 38.6%; score = 4, 68.0%; score = 5, 85.2%; score = 6, 96.4%). Multivariate analyses showed that the J-ERATO score was an independent positive predictor of hospital admission (adjusted OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.06–2.87; P&amp;lt;0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3.73; 2.95–4.72; P&amp;lt;0.001) and in-hospital mortality (1.65; 1.18–2.32; P = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The J-ERATO score is simply assessed and can facilitate the identification of patients with higher risk of heat-related hospitalization.

Isomaltodextrin (IMD) is a novel dietary fiber-like polysaccharide: a type of α-glucan produced from starch using enzymes derived from microorganisms. The results of cohort studies show that dietary fiber can prevent cardiovascular disorders caused by lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of excess fat absorption by dietary fiber is known to be one of the mechanisms, and it is also known that the actions of dietary fiber vary depending on factors such as its structure or origin. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory actions of IMD on fat absorption, and analyzed its mechanism of action. In rats, the absorption of fat given by gavage was significantly lower at 1, 2, and 6 hours after IMD administration than after vehicle administration. In humans, IMD was associated with a lesser increase in blood triglycerides in subjects whose blood triglycerides were otherwise apt to rise.

Isomaltodextrin (IMD) is a novel dietary fiber-like polysaccharide: a type of α-glucan produced from starch using enzymes derived from microorganisms. The results of cohort studies show that dietary fiber can prevent cardiovascular disorders caused by lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of excess fat absorption by dietary fiber is known to be one of the mechanisms, and it is also known that the actions of dietary fiber vary depending on factors such as its structure or origin. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory actions of IMD on fat absorption, and analyzed its mechanism of action. In rats, the absorption of fat given by gavage was significantly lower at 1, 2, and 6 hours after IMD administration than after vehicle administration. In humans, IMD was associated with a lesser increase in blood triglycerides in subjects whose blood triglycerides were otherwise apt to rise. We also found by in vitro emulsion studies that IMD, which had no effect on digestive enzyme activity or emulsion formation, stabilized the micro size micelle by inducing enlarged micelle particle size and increased zeta potential. In conclusion, the mechanism of inhibition of fat absorption by IMD may be a delay in micelle particles accessing the intestinal epithelium through changes in the surface structure and the physical properties of the micelle particles.</description><fingerprint>c77a2e72</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1638963164f:7024851:93d646dc</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/310946v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>4c9bfea5</fingerprint><author><name>Guzman, G.

Bacterial blight (BB) in rice caused by &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas oryzae&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;oryzae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Xoo&lt;/i&gt;) is a major global production constraint, particularly in irrigated and rain-fed lowland areas. Improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM) is an elite, high-yielding, fine-grain type, BB-resistant rice variety possessing three BB-resistant genes (&lt;i&gt;Xa21&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;xa13&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;xa5&lt;/i&gt;) and is highly popular in the southern parts of India. As the BB pathogen is highly dynamic and the evolution of pathogen virulence against the deployed resistance genes is common, we added a novel BB-resistant gene, &lt;i&gt;Xa38&lt;/i&gt;, into ISM through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) to increase the spectrum and durability of BB resistance. The breeding line PR 114 (Xa38) was used as the donor for &lt;i&gt;Xa38&lt;/i&gt;, whereas ISM was used as the recurrent parent. Foreground selection was conducted using PCR-based gene-specific markers for the target genes, whereas background selection was conducted using a set of polymorphic SSR markers between the parents and backcrossing that continued until the third generation. Eighteen homozygous BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plants possessing all four BB-resistant genes in the homozygous state and with a recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery of more than 92% were identified and advanced to the BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; generation.

While many tropical countries are experiencing rapid deforestation, some have experienced forest transition (FT) from net deforestation to net reforestation. Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980–2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009.

While many tropical countries are experiencing rapid deforestation, some have experienced forest transition (FT) from net deforestation to net reforestation. Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980–2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.</description><fingerprint>1730ca12</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163706f8a05:4d963b3:93d646dc</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324541v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>919acfbd</fingerprint><author><name>Asiedu, M.

Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an essential exonuclease in mammalian cells, and numerous in vivo and in vitro data evidenced its participation in immunity regulation and in genotoxicity remediation. In these very complicated cellular functions, the molecular mechanisms by which duplex DNA substrates are processed are mostly elusive because of the lack of structure information. Here, we report multiple crystal structures of TREX1 complexed with various substrates to provide the structure basis for overhang excision and terminal unwinding of DNA duplexes. The substrates were designed to mimic the intermediate structural DNAs involved in various repair pathways. The results showed that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster of TREX1 served to cap the nonscissile 5′-end of the DNA for precise removal of the short 3′-overhang in L- and Y-structural DNA or to wedge into the double-stranded region for further digestion along the duplex. Biochemical assays were also conducted to demonstrate that TREX1 can indeed degrade double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to a full extent. Overall, this study provided unprecedented knowledge at the molecular level on the enzymatic substrate processing involved in prevention of immune activation and in responses to genotoxic stresses. For example, Arg128, whose mutation in TREX1 was linked to a disease state, were shown to exhibit consistent interaction patterns with the nonscissile strand in all of the structures we solved. Such structure basis is expected to play an indispensable role in elucidating the functional activities of TREX1 at the cellular level and in vivo.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nbs4P4qHduo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525715435876</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/nbs4P4qHduo/article</href></item></alternate><published>1525726800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Structural basis for overhang excision and terminal unwinding of DNA duplexes by TREX1</title><recrawled>1525716787382</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Wei Huang, Tung-Chang Liu, Ruei-Yue Liang, Lee-Ya Chu, Hiu-Lo Cheng, Jhih-Wei Chu, Yu-Yuan Hsiao&lt;/p&gt;

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><published>1525899600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Visual perceptual training reconfigures post-task resting-state functional connectivity with a feature-representation region</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196866</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;

Multifractal analysis offers a number of advantages to measure spatial economic segregation and inequality, as it is free of categories and boundaries definition problems and is insensitive to some shape-preserving changes in the variable distribution. We use two datasets describing Kyoto land prices in 1912 and 2012 and derive city models from this data to show that multifractal analysis is suitable to describe the heterogeneity of land prices. We found in particular a sharp decrease in multifractality, characteristic of homogenisation, between older Kyoto and present Kyoto, and similarities both between present Kyoto and present London, and between Kyoto and Manhattan as they were a century ago. In addition, we enlighten the preponderance of spatial distribution over variable distribution in shaping the multifractal spectrum. The results were tested against the classical segregation and inequality indicators, and found to offer an improvement over those.</content></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><published>1525122000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Uncovering inequality through multifractality of land prices: 1912 and contemporary Kyoto</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196737</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hadrien Salat, Roberto Murcio, Keiji Yano, Elsa Arcaute&lt;/p&gt;

Lumbar spinal stenosis causes cauda equina and nerve root compression, resulting in neurological symptoms. Although trunk flexion during level walking may alleviate these symptoms by enabling spinal canal decompression, some patients do not use this strategy. We aimed to identify the kinetic and kinematic variables that affect trunk flexion in patients during level walking. Gait was recorded in 111 patients using a three-dimensional motion capture system and six force plates. From the data recorded, walking velocity, bilateral step length, cycle time, maximum trunk flexion angle, forward pelvic tilt angle, pelvic rotation angle, maximum and minimum joint angles, and moment and power of the lower limb were calculated. Then a step-wise multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion. The maximum hip extension angle (β = 0.416), maximum hip flexion moment (β = -0.348), and step length (β = 0.257) were identified as variables significantly affecting the trunk flexion angle. The coefficient of determination adjusted for the degree of freedom was 0.294 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis choose one of two strategies to alleviate symptoms during walking. One strategy is gait with trunk flexion posture to increase step length and hip extension angle. The other strategy is gait with trunk upright posture to decrease step length and hip extension angle.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion during level walking in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197228</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Igawa, Junji Katsuhira, Akira Hosaka, Kenta Uchikoshi, Shinichi Ishihara, Ko Matsudaira&lt;/p&gt;

Availability: Skyhawk is easy to use and freely available at https://github.com/aquaskyline/Skyhawk</description><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/01/311985</canonicalUrl><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/311985v1?rss=1</link></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163693c73d4:4056c3c:3dd877af</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38361</originId><fingerprint>3e581cfd</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526478959572</crawled><published>1526428800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Quantifying the contribution of Plasmodium falciparum malaria to febrile illness amongst African children</title><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38361</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38361</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Epidemiology and Global Health</item></keywords><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38361</link></item><item><engagement>78</engagement><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d801:93d646dc</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/660?rss=1</originId><keywords><item>Medicine, Diseases</item></keywords><author><name>NA</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain tumor that carries a poor prognosis.

Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells primarily by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in the β-cell membrane. The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><published>1526590800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Binding of sulphonylureas to plasma proteins – A K&amp;lt;sub&gt;ATP&amp;lt;/sub&gt; channel perspective</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Proks, Holger Kramer, Elizabeth Haythorne, Frances M.

We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</description><fingerprint>9be6efb0</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</link></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163456295f2:c1a1d4:2835af05</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318139v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>d43c309e</fingerprint><author><name>Warmenhoven, J.

Background &lt;p&gt;While there is strong evidence showing the survival advantage of elite athletes, much less is known about those engaged in mind sports such as chess. This study aimed to examine the overall as well as regional survival of International Chess Grandmasters (GMs) with a reference to the general population, and compare relative survival (RS) of GMs with that of Olympic medallists (OMs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Information on 1,208 GMs and 15,157 OMs, respectively, from 28 countries were extracted from the publicly available data sources. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rates of the GMs. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust the survival for region, year at risk, age at risk and sex, and to estimate the life expectancy of the GMs. The RS rate was computed by matching each GM or OM by year at risk, age at risk and sex to the life table of the country the individual represented.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The survival rates of GMs at 30 and 60 years since GM title achievement were 87% and 15%, respectively. The life expectancy of GMs at the age of 30 years (which is near the average age when they attained a GM title) was 53.6 ([95% CI]: 47.7–58.5) years, which is significantly greater than the overall weighted mean life expectancy of 45.9 years for the general population. Compared to Eastern Europe, GMs in North America (HR [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.29–0.88]) and Western Europe (HR [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.34–0.83]) had a longer lifespan. The RS analysis showed that both GMs and OMs had a significant survival advantage over the general population, and there was no statistically significant difference in the RS of GMs (RS [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.08–1.20]) compared to OMs: (RS [95% CI]: 1.09 [1.07–1.11]) at 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Elite chess players live longer than the general population and have a similar survival advantage to elite competitors in physical sports.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Longevity of outstanding sporting achievers: Mind versus muscle</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by An Tran-Duy, David C.

Objective &lt;p&gt;We investigated the characteristics of pediatric emergency department (ED) patients in Korea and determined factors associated with hospital admission after ED treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Korea Health Panel data from 2008 through 2013 were analyzed retrospectively; we included patients under 18 years old who visited the ED at least once. We collected patient and household epidemiologic data such as sex, age group, region of residence, disability, chronic disease, household income quintile, national health insurance type, use of private insurance, and annual frequency of ED visits. We also examined data related to each ED visit, such as reason for visit, medical service provided, and hospital size/ownership. We then investigated which factors were correlated with case disposition (discharge home or hospital admission) after ED treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 3,160 pediatric ED visits occurred during the six-year period. Males (57.5%) and children aged 0–5 years (47.7%) made more visits than females and older children, respectively. The proportion of ED visits for disease (67.7%) was much higher than for injury or poisoning (32.2%), and 452 cases (14.3%) required hospital admission. For hospital admission, the odds ratio (OR) of females was 0.73 compared to males, and the OR of children aged 6–11 was 0.68 compared to children aged 0–5. The OR of capital residents was 0.69 compared to province residents, and the OR of the highest income quintile was 0.51 compared to the lowest quintile. The OR of children with private insurance coverage was 0.49 compared to those lacking private insurance, and the OR of ED visits due to disease was 1.82 compared to visits due to injury/poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This analysis of clinical and demographic characteristics of pediatric ED visits and hospital admissions can serve as the foundation of future prospective studies required for establishing appropriate policies for the Korean pediatric emergency medical system.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><published>1527195600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The characteristics of pediatric emergency department visits in Korea: An observational study analyzing Korea Health Panel data</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197929</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dong Hyun Seo, Min Joung Kim, Kyung Hwan Kim, Junseok Park, Dong Wun Shin, Hoon Kim, Woochan Jeon, Hyunjong Kim, Joon Min Park&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. Bovine NK-lysins, a type of AMP, have been predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells. Bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides demonstrate antimicrobial activity against various bacterial pathogens, including several involved in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in cattle; however, such studies are yet to be performed with one important contributor to the BRDC, &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Thirty-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the functional region helices 2 and 3 of bovine NK-lysins NK1, NK2A, NK2B, and NK2C were evaluated for killing activity on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Among four peptides, NK2A and NK2C showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested. All four NK-lysin peptides induced rapid plasma membrane depolarization in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; at two concentrations tested. However, based on propidium iodide uptake, only NK2A and NK2C appeared capable of causing structural damage to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; plasma membrane. Confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy further suggested NK-lysin-induced damage to the plasma membrane. Taken together, the findings in this study suggest that plasma membrane depolarization alone was insufficient to induce lethality, but disruption/permeabilization of the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; plasma membrane was the cause of lethality.</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><published>1526590800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma bovis&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197677</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rohana P.

Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 72.71% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 86.64%, indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq (pred) is 67.45%, which is not very high, indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms.

Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 72.71% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 86.64%, indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq (pred) is 67.45%, which is not very high, indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 73.32% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 79.49%, indicating that 79.49% of the response variability can be explained by the model. Using the optimization software MODE Frontier (Optimization, MOGA-II, 2014), four types of response surfaces for the three considered response variables were tested for the data of DOE.

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Measles is an infectious disease that represents a serious public health problem worldwide, being associated with increased susceptibility to secondary infections, especially in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The aim of this study was to evaluate sCD163 and sCD14 levels in measles virus (MV) infected patients, as markers of immune activation, in order to better understand their role in the pathogenesis of the disease. TNF-α plasma levels were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;sCD163, sCD14 and TNF-α were measured by ELISA in plasma samples of 27 MV infected patients and 27 healthy donors (HD) included as controls.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At the time of hospital admission, sCD163 and sCD14 levels were significantly higher in MV infected patients than in HD, while a decrease in TNF-α levels were found even if without statistical significance. sCD163 and sCD14 levels were significantly decreased after two months from acute infection compared to hospital admission although they remained significantly higher compared to HD. TNF-α levels increased significantly during the follow-up period.

Loss or gain of copy number of the gene encoding the transcription factor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (Rett and MeCP2 duplication syndrome), indicating that precisely regulated MeCP2 expression during development is critical for mental health. Consistent with this idea, MeCP2 null mutants exhibit synaptic regression in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual relay center in the thalamus, a phenotype resembling that of animals reared in the dark during the visual sensitive period. It remains unclear how MeCP2 expression is regulated during circuit formation and maturation, especially in excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons. We found that, concomitant with the initiation of the dark-rearing sensitive period, MeCP2 protein levels were elevated in glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons of the dLGN. Moreover, MeCP2 expression in glutamatergic populations was selectively reduced by dark-rearing. Therefore, we propose that visual experience–dependent MeCP2 induction in glutamatergic populations is essential for synaptic maturation within the dLGN.</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><published>1527714000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Experience-dependent MeCP2 expression in the excitatory cells of mouse visual thalamus</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198268</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>1d70d078</fingerprint><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Yagasaki, Goichi Miyoshi, Mariko Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><published>1525986000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>The impact of being bullied at school on psychological distress and work engagement in a community sample of adult workers in Japan</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;

We investigated differences in the achievement of glycemic control among newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes patients according to gender using a multi-clinic retrospective cohort study. Optimal glycemic control was defined as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of less than 6.5% after 1 year of diabetes management. A generalized linear mixed model, which controlled for the fixed effects of baseline characteristics and prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA), was used to calculate the probability of achieving the target HbA1c. The study included 2,253 newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes patients who completed 1 year of diabetic management, including OHA, in the 36 participating primary clinics. Within the study population, the women had an older average age, were less likely to smoke or drink alcohol, and showed lower levels of fasting blood glucose and HbA1c at the time of diagnosis. There were no significant differences by sex in prescribed OHA or median number of visits. After 1 year of diabetes management, 38.9% of women and 40.6% of men achieved the target HbA1c—a small but significant difference. This suggests that type-2 diabetes is managed less well in women than in men.</content></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><published>1525294800000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Women are less likely than men to achieve optimal glycemic control after 1 year of treatment: A multi-level analysis of a Korean primary care cohort</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196719</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung-Ah Choe, Joo Yeong Kim, Young Sun Ro, Sung-Il Cho&lt;/p&gt;

For the last 100 years, it has been uncontroversial to state that the plant germline is set aside late in development, but there is surprisingly little evidence to support this view. In contrast, much evolutionary theory and several recent empirical studies seem to suggest the opposite—that the germlines of some and perhaps most plants may be set aside early in development. But is this really the case? How much does it matter? How can we reconcile the new evidence with existing knowledge of plant development? And is there a way to reliably establish the timing of germline segregation in both model and nonmodel plants? Answering these questions is vital to understanding one of the most fundamental aspects of plant development and evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0LiCyHbkEf4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1526493856788</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/0LiCyHbkEf4/article</href></item></alternate><published>1526504400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Do plants have a segregated germline?</title><recrawled>1526494327964</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Lanfear&lt;/p&gt;

Electroporation of zygotes represents a rapid alternative to the elaborate pronuclear injection procedure for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mice. However, current protocols for electroporation either require the investment in specialized electroporators or corrosive pre-treatment of zygotes which compromises embryo viability. Here, we describe an easily adaptable approach for the introduction of specific mutations in C57BL/6 mice by electroporation of intact zygotes using a common electroporator with synthetic CRISPR/Cas9 components and minimal technical requirement. Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring. Hence, our novel approach for Easy Electroporation of Zygotes (EEZy) allows highly efficient generation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic mice while reducing the numbers of animals required.</content></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><published>1525381200000</published><unread>True</unread><title>An optimized electroporation approach for efficient CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in murine zygotes</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196891</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simon E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, especially by using rapid molecular assays, can reduce transmission of drug resistant tuberculosis in communities.

Sequence analysis of the &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt; rifampicin-resistance determining region (&lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR) revealed mutations in six codons: 588, 531, 526, 516, 513, and 511, of which Ser531Leu was the most frequent (40%, 18/45). Overall, the three mutations (Ser531Leu, His526Tyr, Asp516Tyr) frequently associated with rifampicin-resistance occurred in 76% of the rifampicin resistant isolates while 18% (8/45) of the rifampicin-resistant isolates lacked mutations in &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR. Furthermore, sequence analysis of &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter revealed mainly the Ser315Thr (76%, 38/50) and C(-15)T (8%, 4/50) mutations, respectively. These two mutations combined, which are frequently associated with isoniazid-resistance, occurred in 88% of the isoniazid resistant isolates. However, 20% (10/50) of the isoniazid-resistant isolates lacked mutations both in &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter. The sensitivity of sequence analysis of &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR for rifampicin-resistance via detection of high confidence mutations (Ser531Leu, His526Tyr, Asp516Tyr) was 81%, while it was 77% for analysis of &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter to detect isoniazid-resistance via detection of high confidence mutations (Ser315Thr, C(-15)T, T(-8)C).

Background &lt;p&gt;Accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, especially by using rapid molecular assays, can reduce transmission of drug resistant tuberculosis in communities. However, the frequency of resistance conferring mutations varies with geographic location of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, and this affects the efficiency of rapid molecular assays in detecting resistance.
