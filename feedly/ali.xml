Interleukin 17 (IL-17)–producing γδ T cells (γδ17 T cells) have been recently found to promote tumor growth and metastasis formation. How such γδ17 T-cell responses may be regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we report that tumor-associated neutrophils can display an overt antitumor role by strongly suppressing γδ17 T cells. Tumor-associated neutrophils inhibited the proliferation of murine CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells via induction of oxidative stress, thereby preventing them from constituting the major source of pro-tumoral IL-17 in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that low expression of the antioxidant glutathione in CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells renders them particularly susceptible to neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistently, superoxide deficiency, or the administration of a glutathione precursor, rescued CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T-cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, human Vδ1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ T cells, which contain most γδ17 T cells found in cancer patients, also displayed low glutathione levels and were potently inhibited by ROS. This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>d05a552a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004990</link><crawled>1526060694416</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f4:f3bf0074</id><author><name>Sofia Mensurado</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Mensurado, Margarida Rei, Telma Lança, Marianna Ioannou, Natacha Gonçalves-Sousa, Hiroshi Kubo, Marie Malissen, Venizelos Papayannopoulos, Karine Serre, Bruno Silva-Santos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; is a cell-cycle regulator. &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; has been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, but few researchers have studied &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; in shrimps. We cloned &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; from the black tiger shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Penaeus monodon&lt;/i&gt;). The full-length cDNA sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. The lowest &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression was noted in stage III of ovarian development in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression decreased significantly after injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and eyestalk ablation in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; ovaries. RNA interference experiments were undertaken to examine the expression of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PmCDC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PmCyclin B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in the ovaries and hepatopancreas by dsRNA-Chk1 was successful. The localization and level of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression in the hepatopancreas was studied using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, which showed that data were in accordance with those of qRT-PCR. The Gonadosomatic Index of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; after dsRNA-Chk1 injection was significantly higher than that after injection of dsRNA-GFP or phosphate-buffered saline.

Invasions of Ponto-Caspian fish species into north-western European river basins accelerated since the opening of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal in 1992. Since 2002, at least five Ponto-Caspian alien fish species have arrived in The Netherlands. Four species belong to the Gobiidae family (&lt;i&gt;Neogobius fluviatilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neogobius melanostomus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ponticola kessleri&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Proterorhinus semilunaris&lt;/i&gt;) and one to the Cyprinidae family (&lt;i&gt;Romanogobio belingi&lt;/i&gt;). These species are expected to be potentially deleterious for the populations of four native benthic fish species: &lt;i&gt;Gobio gobio&lt;/i&gt; (Cyprinidae), &lt;i&gt;Barbatula barbatula&lt;/i&gt; (Nemacheilidae), &lt;i&gt;Cottus perifretum&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rhenanus&lt;/i&gt; (Cottidae). Invasion success may be dependent on competitive trophic interactions with native species, which are enabled and/or constrained by feeding-related morphological traits. Twenty-two functional feeding traits were measured in nine species (in total 90 specimens). These traits were quantitatively linked to the mechanical, chemical and behavioral properties of a range of aquatic resource categories, using a previously developed food-fish model (FFM). The FFM was used to predict the trophic profile (TP) of each fish: the combined capacities to feed on each of the resource types. The most extreme TPs belonged to three alien species, indicating that they were most specialized among the studied species. Of these three, only &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kessleri&lt;/i&gt; overlapped with the two native &lt;i&gt;Cottus&lt;/i&gt; species, indicating potential trophic competition. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fluviatilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;belingi&lt;/i&gt; did not show any overlap, indicating that there is low trophic competition. The two remaining alien goby species (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanostomus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;semilunaris&lt;/i&gt;) had average TPs and could be considered generalist feeders. They overlapped with each other and with &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gobio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbatula&lt;/i&gt;, indicating potential trophic competition. This study suggests that both generalist and specialist species can be successful invaders. Since the FFM predicts potential interactions between species, it provides a tool to support horizon scanning and rapid risk assessments of alien species.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>2</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>e4068387</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197636</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f42:2835af05</id><author><name>Leopold A.

Retention in care remains an important issue for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs according to WHO guidelines, formerly called the “Option B+” approach. The objective of this study was to examine how poverty, gender, and health system factors interact to influence women’s participation in PMTCT services. We used qualitative research, literature, and hypothesized variable connections to diagram causes and effects in causal loop models. We found that many factors, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, service design and quality, stigma, disclosure, spouse/partner influence, decision-making autonomy, and knowledge about PMTCT, influence psychosocial health, which in turn affects women’s participation in PMTCT services. Thus, interventions to improve psychosocial health need to address many factors to be successful. We also found that the design of PMTCT services, a modifiable factor, is important because it affects several other factors. We identified 66 feedback loops that may contribute to policy resistance—that is, a policy’s failure to have its intended effect. Our findings point to the need for a multipronged intervention to encourage women’s continued participation in PMTCT services and for longitudinal research to quantify and test our causal loop model.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>27e78eeb</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197239</link><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721e:2835af05</id><author><name>Jennifer Yourkavitch</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Yourkavitch, Kristen Hassmiller Lich, Valerie L.

Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells primarily by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in the β-cell membrane. The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated><fingerprint>9be6efb0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543a:93d646dc</id><author><name>Peter Proks</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Proks, Holger Kramer, Elizabeth Haythorne, Frances M.

investigate and manipulate nanocolloids.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335554v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>cytometree: a binary tree algorithm for automatic gating in cytometry analysis [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/31/335554</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335554v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Flow cytometry is a powerful technology that allows the high-throughput quantification of dozens of surface and intracellular proteins at the single-cell level.

A common challenge in systems biology is quantifying the effects of unknown parameters and estimating parameter values from data. For many systems, this task is computationally intractable due to expensive model evaluations and large numbers of parameters. In this work, we investigate a new method for performing sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of complex biological models using techniques from uncertainty quantification. The primary advance is a significant improvement in computational efficiency from the replacement of model simulation by evaluation of a polynomial surrogate model. We demonstrate the method on two models of mating in budding yeast: a smaller ODE model of the heterotrimeric G-protein cycle, and a larger spatial model of pheromone-induced cell polarization. A small number of model simulations are used to fit the polynomial surrogates, which are then used to calculate global parameter sensitivities. The surrogate models also allow rapid Bayesian inference of the parameters via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) by eliminating model simulations at each step. Application to the ODE model shows results consistent with published single-point estimates for the model and data, with the added benefit of calculating the correlations between pairs of parameters. On the larger PDE model, the surrogate models allowed convergence for the distribution of 15 parameters, which otherwise would have been computationally prohibitive using simulations at each MCMC step. We inferred parameter distributions that in certain cases peaked at values different from published values, and showed that a wide range of parameters would permit polarization in the model. Strikingly our results suggested different diffusion constants for active versus inactive Cdc42 to achieve good polarization, which is consistent with experimental observations in another yeast species &lt;i&gt;S. pombe&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sRhq-0CxzAI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>1110d50</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006181</link><crawled>1527617284143</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163ad15e82f:1385da8:c2c34441</id><author><name>Marissa Renardy</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marissa Renardy, Tau-Mu Yi, Dongbin Xiu, Ching-Shan Chou&lt;/p&gt;

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) patients frequently show autonomic symptoms which may be associated with a hypothalamic dysfunction. This study aimed to explore circadian rhythm patterns in rest and activity and distal skin temperature (DST) and their association with self-reported outcome measures, in CFS/ME patients and healthy controls at two different times of year. Ten women who met both the 1994 CDC/Fukuda definition and 2003 Canadian criteria for CFS/ME were included in the study, along with ten healthy controls matched for age, sex and body mass index. Self-reported measures were used to assess fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, autonomic function and health-related quality of life. The ActTrust actigraph was used to record activity, DST and light intensity, with data intervals of one minute over seven consecutive days. Sleep variables were obtained through actigraphic analysis and from subjective sleep diary. The circadian variables and the spectral analysis of the rhythms were calculated. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the rhythmic variables and clinical features. Recordings were taken in the same subjects in winter and summer. Results showed no differences in rhythm stability, sleep latency or number of awakenings between groups as measured with the actigraph.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) patients frequently show autonomic symptoms which may be associated with a hypothalamic dysfunction. This study aimed to explore circadian rhythm patterns in rest and activity and distal skin temperature (DST) and their association with self-reported outcome measures, in CFS/ME patients and healthy controls at two different times of year. Ten women who met both the 1994 CDC/Fukuda definition and 2003 Canadian criteria for CFS/ME were included in the study, along with ten healthy controls matched for age, sex and body mass index. Self-reported measures were used to assess fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, autonomic function and health-related quality of life. The ActTrust actigraph was used to record activity, DST and light intensity, with data intervals of one minute over seven consecutive days. Sleep variables were obtained through actigraphic analysis and from subjective sleep diary. The circadian variables and the spectral analysis of the rhythms were calculated. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the rhythmic variables and clinical features. Recordings were taken in the same subjects in winter and summer. Results showed no differences in rhythm stability, sleep latency or number of awakenings between groups as measured with the actigraph. However, daily activity, the relative amplitude and the stability of the activity rhythm were lower in CFS/ME patients than in controls. DST was sensitive to environmental temperature and showed lower nocturnal values in CFS/ME patients than controls only in winter. A spectral analysis showed no differences in phase or amplitude of the 24h rhythm, but the power of the second harmonic (12h), revealed differences between groups (controls showed a post-lunch dip in activity and peak in DST, while CFS/ME patients did not) and correlated with clinical features. These findings suggest that circadian regulation and skin vasodilator responses may play a role in CFS/ME.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/G6Rj1eYsm-U/acs.biochem.8b00296</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Repurposed HisC Aminotransferases Complete the Biosynthesis of Some Methanobactins</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00296/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00296t_0005.gif</url><height>227</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00296</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00296</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00296/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00296t_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00296&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Intercropping is an important agronomic practice adopted to increase crop production and resource efficiency in areas with intensive agricultural production. Two sequential field trials were conducted in 2015–2016 to investigate the effect of shading on the morphological features, leaf structure, and photosynthetic characteristics of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system. Three treatments were designed on the basis of different row configurations A1 (“50 cm + 50 cm” one row of maize and one row of soybean with a 50 cm spacing between the rows), A2 (“160 cm + 40 cm” two rows of maize by wide-narrow row planting, where two rows of soybean were planted in the wide rows with a width of 40 cm, and with 60 cm row spacing was used between the maize and soybean rows), and CK (sole cropping of soybean, with 70 cm rows spacing). Results showed that the photosynthetically active radiation transmittances of soybean canopy at V5 stage under A2 treatment (31.1%) were considerably higher than those under A1 (8.7%) treatment, and the red-to-far-red ratio was reduced significantly under A1 (0.7) and A2 (1.0) treatments compared with those under CK (1.2). By contrast with CK, stem diameter, total aboveground biomass, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate decreased significantly except plant height under A1 and A2. The thickness of palisade tissue and spongy tissue of soybean leaf under A1 and A2 were significantly reduced at V5 stage compared with CK. The leaf thicknesses under A1 and A2 were lower than those in CK by 39.5% and 18.2%, respectively. At the R1 stage of soybean (after maize harvest), the soybean plant height, stem biomass, leaf biomass and petiole biomass under A1 and A2 treatments were still significantly lower than those under CK, but no significant differences were observed in Chl a/b, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, epidermis thickness and spongy tissue thickness of soybean leaves in A2 compared with CK. In addition, the soybean yields (g plant&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) under A1 and A2 were 54.69% and 16.83% lower than those in CK, respectively. These findings suggested that soybean plants can regulate its morphological characteristics and leaf anatomical structures under different light environments.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>50982e0b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198159</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b945:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Yuanfang Fan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanfang Fan, Junxu Chen, Yajiao Cheng, Muhammad Ali Raza, Xiaoling Wu, Zhonglin Wang, Qinlin Liu, Rui Wang, Xiaochun Wang, Taiwen Yong, Weiguo Liu, Jiang Liu, Junbo Du, Kai Shu, Wenyu Yang, Feng Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Human interpretation of diagnostic indicators from visual inspection is qualitative, subjective and has high inter-observer discordance, which could lead both to adverse outcomes for the patient and unnecessary follow-ups. In this work, we propose methods for (1) automatic feature extraction and classification for VIA and VILI cervigrams and (2) combining features of VIA/VILI cervigrams for improved performance.

Human interpretation of diagnostic indicators from visual inspection is qualitative, subjective and has high inter-observer discordance, which could lead both to adverse outcomes for the patient and unnecessary follow-ups. In this work, we propose methods for (1) automatic feature extraction and classification for VIA and VILI cervigrams and (2) combining features of VIA/VILI cervigrams for improved performance. Cervix images (cervigrams) were acquired with a low-cost, miniature, digital colposcope. We describe algorithms to pre-process pathology-labeled cervigrams and extract simple but powerful color and textural-based features. The features are used to train a support vector machine(SVM) to classify cervigrams based on pathology for VIA, VILI, and combination of the two contrasts.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Treatment failures in advanced lung cancer are frequent events affecting patients during or after first-line chemotherapy. International guidelines recommend second-line chemotherapy. However, around one half of patients who experience disease progression enter a systemic second-line therapy. In the herein qualitative study, we investigated patients&apos; thoughts and attitudes determining the decision to undergo a second-line chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Thirty-three purposively selected patients who recently accepted second-line or palliative chemotherapy were invited to participate in this survey consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Grounded theory was applied to investigate participants’ perceptions of the context that have surrounded their decision to undergo palliative chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For most patients, tumor burden and reduced quality of life in relation with lung cancer itself were major drivers of the decision-making process. There was a balance between two different attitudes: making a decision to undergo a new line of chemotherapy or starting a psychological process in order to accept end of life. Choosing between these two attitudes allowed the patient to keep the matter of palliative care at a distance. Even in case of low chance of success, many patients who worried about their life partner&apos;s future would accept a new chemotherapy line. Some patients experienced ambivalent thoughts regarding social network, particularly about their family as daily function impairment required an increased need for relative&apos;s support. The initial &amp;quot;Worrying about others&amp;quot; thoughts left place to in an increasing self-need of care as those provided by relatives; this phenomenon might increase patients&apos; self- perception of being a burden for others. Confidence previously established with formal caregiver support was another major decision driver: some patients with sustained confidence in their medical staff may have privileged this formal support rather than family support when the latter was perceived as weak, insufficient or intrusive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study identified three domains involved into a complex interplay for lung cancer patients’ decision regarding second-line palliative chemotherapy: (i) perception of the definitive loss of health, (ii) interactions between idiosyncrasy (hope, disease burden) and environment (healthcare and social network support), and (iii) patient&apos;s subjective evaluation of chemotherapy benefit–risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>8ee70238</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197605</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd70:3dd877af</id><author><name>Jean-Louis Pujol</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jean-Louis Pujol, Benoît Roch, Caroline Roth, Jean-Pierre Mérel&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Mobile Health (mHealth) programs have increasingly been used to tackle maternal and child health problems in low and middle income countries. However, few studies have evaluated how these programs have been perceived by intended users and beneficiaries. Therefore, we explored perceptions of healthcare officials and beneficiaries regarding RapidSMS Rwanda, an mHealth system used by Community Health Workers (CHWs) that was scaled up nationwide in 2013.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders, providers, and beneficiaries of maternal and child health services at both the national and community levels. Semi-structured interviews were used to assess perceptions about the impact of and challenges facing the RapidSMS system. Interviews and focus group discussions were recorded (with the exception of one), transcribed verbatim, and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We conducted a total of 28 in-depth interviews and 10 focus group discussions (93 total participants). A majority of respondents believed that RapidSMS contributed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. RapidSMS was generally accepted by both CHWs and parents. Participants identified insufficient training, a lack of equipment, and low CHW motivation as the main challenges facing RapidSMS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that an mHealth program can be well accepted by both policymakers, health providers, and the community. We also found significant technical challenges that have likely reduced its impact. Addressing these challenges will serve to strengthen future mHealth programs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>f767e69b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198725</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b313:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Angele Musabyimana</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angele Musabyimana, Hinda Ruton, Erick Gaju, Atakilt Berhe, Karen A.

Dill, Adam M.R. de Graff&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;The accumulation of protein damage in aging organisms is thought to contribute to many aging-related diseases. Yet the properties determining which proteins are most susceptible remain poorly understood. Are certain conformations more vulnerable? Which chaperones are the main guardians? We address these questions with a system-wide model of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; proteostasis. By predicting how proteins with different folding properties respond to each chaperone&apos;s concentration, the model computes “damage fingerprints” that identify unfolded conformations as the major damage target. What matters most is not a protein&apos;s stability or difficulty of folding, but its dwell time in an unfolded state. The main guardian chaperone is DnaK because its client proteins spend more time unfolded than clients of GroEL, providing a mechanism for why the cell&apos;s capacity to handle stress is more sensitive to DnaK levels. Also, we find that chaperones are protectors, not recyclers.

Dill, Adam M.R. de Graff&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;The accumulation of protein damage in aging organisms is thought to contribute to many aging-related diseases. Yet the properties determining which proteins are most susceptible remain poorly understood. Are certain conformations more vulnerable? Which chaperones are the main guardians? We address these questions with a system-wide model of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; proteostasis. By predicting how proteins with different folding properties respond to each chaperone&apos;s concentration, the model computes “damage fingerprints” that identify unfolded conformations as the major damage target. What matters most is not a protein&apos;s stability or difficulty of folding, but its dwell time in an unfolded state. The main guardian chaperone is DnaK because its client proteins spend more time unfolded than clients of GroEL, providing a mechanism for why the cell&apos;s capacity to handle stress is more sensitive to DnaK levels. Also, we find that chaperones are protectors, not recyclers. This model describes how cells resist stress and indicates that designing chaperone-targeting drugs may require whole-cell, system-wide modeling.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img width=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2405471218301893-fx1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot;&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Teaser&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div&gt;We present a computational model of cell-wide proteostasis in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to understand the role of chaperones in regulating oxidative damage.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The pathogenic role of the lysophospholipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate and its receptor S1PR2 in lung fibrosis is unknown. We show here that genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; strikingly attenuated lung fibrosis induced by repeated injections of bleomycin in mice. We observed by using &lt;i&gt;S1pr&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice that S1PR2 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells in the lung and that S1PR2-expressing cells accumulated in the fibrotic legions. Bone marrow chimera experiments suggested that S1PR2 in bone marrow–derived cells contributes to the development of lung fibrosis. Depletion of macrophages greatly attenuated lung fibrosis. Bleomycin administration stimulated the mRNA expression of the profibrotic cytokines IL-13 and IL-4 and the M2 markers including arginase 1, Fizz1/&lt;i&gt;Retnla&lt;/i&gt;, Ccl17 and Ccl24 in cells collected from broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), and &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; deletion markedly diminished the stimulated expression of these genes. BALF cells from bleomycin–administered wild-type mice showed a marked increase in phosphorylation of STAT6, a transcription factor which is activated downstream of IL-13, compared with saline–administered wild-type mice. Interestingly, in bleomycin–administered &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, STAT6 phosphorylation in BALF cells was substantially diminished compared with wild-type mice. Finally, pharmacological S1PR2 blockade in &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice alleviated bleomycin–induced lung fibrosis. Thus, S1PR2 facilitates lung fibrosis through the mechanisms involving augmentation of IL-13 expression and its signaling in BALF cells, and represents a novel target for treating lung fibrosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>33641c1d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197604</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761233:93d646dc</id><author><name>Juanjuan Zhao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juanjuan Zhao, Yasuo Okamoto, Yuya Asano, Kazuhiro Ishimaru, Sho Aki, Kazuaki Yoshioka, Noriko Takuwa, Takashi Wada, Yutaka Inagaki, Chiaki Takahashi, Takumi Nishiuchi, Yoh Takuwa&lt;/p&gt;

The ease with which the &lt;i&gt;ykkC&lt;/i&gt; aptamer acquires new specificity represents a striking case of evolvability in RNA.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36381</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/_RskXu-lKvk/acs.biochem.8b00385</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Characterization and Structural Analysis of a Novel exo-Type Enzyme Acting on ß-1,2-Glucooligosaccharides from Parabacteroides distasonis</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00385/20180525/images/medium/bi-2018-00385t_0009.gif</url><height>156</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00385</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00385</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00385/20180525/images/medium/bi-2018-00385t_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00385&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours. This might allow a timely administration of a suitable treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>ae2ccf24</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197436</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8c:93d646dc</id><author><name>Martina Tassinari</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Tassinari, Silvia Zannoli, Patrizia Farabegoli, Maria Federica Pedna, Anna Pierro, Antonio Mastroianni, Riccardo Fontan, Luciano Luongo, Giuseppe Sarnataro, Elisa Menegatti, Assunta Caruso, Vittorio Sambri&lt;/p&gt;

Newcastle disease (ND) causes severe economic loss to poultry industry worldwide. Frequent outbreaks of ND in commercial chickens vaccinated with live vaccines suggest a need to develop improved vaccines that are genetically matched against circulating Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains. In this study, the fusion protein cleavage site (FPCS) sequence of NDV strain Banjarmasin/010 (Banj), a genotype VII NDV, was individually modified using primer mutagenesis to those of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes 2, 7 and 8 and compared with the recombinant Banjarmasin (rBanj) with avirulent NDV LaSota cleavage site (rBanj-LaSota). These FPCS mutations changed the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell-to-cell fusion activity and made rBanj FPCS mutant viruses highly attenuated in chickens. When chickens immunized with the rBanj FPCS mutant viruses and challenged with the virulent Banj, there was reduced challenge virus shedding observed compared to chickens immunized with the heterologous vaccine strain LaSota. Among the genotype VII NDV Banj vaccine candidates, rBanj-LaSota and rBanj containing FPCS of APMV-8 induced highest neutralizing antibody titers and protected chickens with reduced challenge virus shedding. These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>721947cc</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197253</link><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219d:93d646dc</id><author><name>Vinoth K.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To facilitate precise local ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a setting of combined ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), we evaluated accuracy and efficiency of a novel technique for navigated positioning of ablation probes using intrahepatic tumor referencing and electromagnetic (EM) guidance, in a porcine model.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An angiographic wire with integrated EM reference sensor at its tip was inserted via a transarterial femoral access and positioned in the vicinity of artificial liver tumors. The resulting offset distance between the tumor center and the intrahepatic endovascular EM reference was calculated. Subsequently, EM tracked ablation probes were inserted percutaneously and navigated toward the tumor center, relying on continuous EM guidance via the intrahepatic reference. Targeting accuracy was assessed as the Euclidean distance between the tip of the ablation probe and the tumor center (Target Positioning Error, TPE). Procedural efficiency was assessed as time efforts for tumor referencing and tumor targeting.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 6 animals, 124 targeting measurements were performed with an offset distance &amp;lt; 30 mm (clinically most feasible position), resulting in a mean TPE of 2.9 ± 1.6 mm. No significant correlation between the TPE and different intrahepatic offset distances (range 21 to 61 mm, n = 365) was shown as long as the EM reference was placed within the liver. However, the mean TPE increased when placing the EM reference externally on the animal skin (p &amp;lt; 0.01). TPE was similar when targeting under continuous ventilation or in apnea (p = 0.50). Mean time for tumor referencing and navigated targeting was 6.5 ± 3.8 minutes and 14 ± 8 seconds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The proposed technique allows precise and efficient navigated positioning of ablation probes into liver tumors in the animal model.

The immortal strand hypothesis poses that stem cells could produce differentiated progeny while conserving the original template strand, thus avoiding accumulating somatic mutations. However, quantitating the extent of non-random DNA strand segregation in human stem cells remains difficult &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that the change of the mean and variance of the mutational burden with age in healthy human tissues allows estimating strand segregation probabilities and somatic mutation rates. We analysed deep sequencing data from healthy human colon, small intestine, liver, skin and brain.

The immortal strand hypothesis poses that stem cells could produce differentiated progeny while conserving the original template strand, thus avoiding accumulating somatic mutations. However, quantitating the extent of non-random DNA strand segregation in human stem cells remains difficult &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that the change of the mean and variance of the mutational burden with age in healthy human tissues allows estimating strand segregation probabilities and somatic mutation rates. We analysed deep sequencing data from healthy human colon, small intestine, liver, skin and brain. We found highly effective non-random DNA strand segregation in all adult tissues (mean strand segregation probability: 0.98, standard error bounds (0.97,0.99)). In contrast, non-random strand segregation efficiency is reduced to 0.87 (0.78,0.88) in neural tissue during early development, suggesting stem cell pool expansions due to symmetric self-renewal.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that visual cortex engages in spatio-temporal sequence learning and prediction. The cellular basis of this learning remains unclear, however. Here we present a spiking neural network model that explains a recent study on sequence learning in the primary visual cortex of rats. The model posits that the sequence learning and prediction abilities of cortical circuits result from the interaction of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. It also reproduces changes in stimulus-evoked multi-unit activity during learning. Furthermore, it makes precise predictions regarding how training shapes network connectivity to establish its prediction ability. Finally, it predicts that the adapted connectivity gives rise to systematic changes in spontaneous network activity. Taken together, our model establishes a new conceptual bridge between the structure and function of cortical circuits in the context of sequence learning and prediction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zOLtDY7_1Wk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>452d7645</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006187</link><crawled>1528220849540</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163d10f9584:14e7082:a96d255</id><author><name>Christian Klos</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Klos, Daniel Miner, Jochen Triesch&lt;/p&gt;

Aim &lt;p&gt;To determine choroidal thickness in healthy Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study; healthy Indian subjects (n = 230) with no history of ocular and/or systemic disorders were enrolled in the study. Choroidal thickness was measured for 230 eyes using SS-OCT. Subjects were divided into six age groups. Main outcome measures were subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular choroidal thickness (MCT) up to 3 mm at 500-micron interval from the fovea was measured in eight different quadrants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean SFCT was 307±79 μm and mean MCT was 285±75 μm. No difference in the choroidal thickness was found among genders. Mean SFCT of the different age groups was 327±68 μm (12–18 years), 364±70 μm (18.1–30 years), 321±78 μm (30.1–40 years), 304±79 μm (40.1–50 years), 283±69 μm (50.1–60 years) and 262±72μm (above 60 years; p &amp;lt;0.001; One way ANOVA). Mean macular choroidal thickness was 305±60 μm, 342±61 μm, 306±72 μm, 282±79 μm, 261±66 μm, 238±68μm respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001; one way ANOVA). A significant weak negative correlation was found between age with SFCT (r = -0.368, p&amp;lt;0.001) and MCT (r = -0.40, p&amp;lt;0.001). No significant correlation was found with refractive error, axial length and ocular perfusion pressure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that mean SFCT and MCT was 307±79μm and 285±75 μm, respectively, among healthy Indian subjects.

Background &lt;p&gt;The typical degeneration of the vertebral endplate shown in MRI imaging is Modic change. The aim of this study was to observe the distribution of the Modic changes of vertebral endplate in degenerative thoracolumbar/lumbar kyphosis (DTK/LK) patients and analyse the correlation between spinal-pelvic parameters and Modic changes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The imaging data of 58 patients diagnosed with DTK/LK (coronal Cobb angle&amp;lt;10°with sagittal imbalance) in our hospital from March 2016 to May 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Observe the prevalence, type and distribution characteristics of Modic changes occurred at the vertebral endplate from T10 to S1;analyse the correlation between Modic changes and disc degeneration, the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT) and pelvic incidence (PI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 928 intervertebral endplates from 58 patients, Modic changes occurred at 90 endplates (9.7%) of 30 patients (51.7%). 5 endplates (0.5%) of 3 patients (5.2%) were classified as type I, 68 endplates (7.3%) of 25 patients (43.1%) as type II, 17 endplates (1.8%) of 9 patients (15.5%) as type III. The location of the degenerative endplates: 2 (2.2%) superior and inferior endplates of L1, 3 (3.3%) inferior endplates of T11and T12, 4 (4.4%) superior endplates of L2, 6 (6.7%) inferior endplates of L2 and L4, 8 (8.9%) superior endplates of S1, 9 (10%) superior endplates of L3, 11 (12.2%) inferior endplates of L3 and L5 and superior endplates of L4, 12 (13.3%) superior endplates of L5.

Background &lt;p&gt;The typical degeneration of the vertebral endplate shown in MRI imaging is Modic change. The aim of this study was to observe the distribution of the Modic changes of vertebral endplate in degenerative thoracolumbar/lumbar kyphosis (DTK/LK) patients and analyse the correlation between spinal-pelvic parameters and Modic changes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The imaging data of 58 patients diagnosed with DTK/LK (coronal Cobb angle&amp;lt;10°with sagittal imbalance) in our hospital from March 2016 to May 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Observe the prevalence, type and distribution characteristics of Modic changes occurred at the vertebral endplate from T10 to S1;analyse the correlation between Modic changes and disc degeneration, the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT) and pelvic incidence (PI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 928 intervertebral endplates from 58 patients, Modic changes occurred at 90 endplates (9.7%) of 30 patients (51.7%). 5 endplates (0.5%) of 3 patients (5.2%) were classified as type I, 68 endplates (7.3%) of 25 patients (43.1%) as type II, 17 endplates (1.8%) of 9 patients (15.5%) as type III. The location of the degenerative endplates: 2 (2.2%) superior and inferior endplates of L1, 3 (3.3%) inferior endplates of T11and T12, 4 (4.4%) superior endplates of L2, 6 (6.7%) inferior endplates of L2 and L4, 8 (8.9%) superior endplates of S1, 9 (10%) superior endplates of L3, 11 (12.2%) inferior endplates of L3 and L5 and superior endplates of L4, 12 (13.3%) superior endplates of L5. Modic changes were significantly correlated with intervertebral disc degeneration (r = 0.414, p&amp;lt;0.01); the amount of Modic changes were significantly correlated with LL (r = -0.562, p = 0.012), SS (r = -0.46, p = 0.048), PT (r = 0.516, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most of the Modic changes of vertebral endplates in DTK/LK patients are type II which are prevalently located at L3/4, L4/5 and L5/S1.

Peptidergic sensory neurons play a critical role in nociceptive pathways. To precisely define the function and plasticity of sensory neurons in detail, new tools such as transgenic mouse models are needed. We employed electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry to characterize in detail dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons expressing an inducible CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt; (CGRP-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); and compared them to DRG neurons expressing Nav1.8&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; (Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; (TRPV1-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and TRPV1-GFP (V1-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Tamoxifen effectively induced CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt; production in DRG. ≈87% of CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt;-expressing neurons were co-labeled CGRP antibody. Three small and two medium-large-sized (5HT3a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NPY2R&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and NPY2R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neuronal groups with unique electrophysiological profiles were CGRP-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were detected in all CGRP-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups, as well as in 5 additional neuronal groups: MrgprD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, MrgprD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CGRP&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, vGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ≈30% of trkC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Differences between TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; and Nav1.8&lt;sup&gt;cre&lt;/sup&gt; reporters were that unlike TRPV1-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; expression was detected in non-nociceptive vGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and trkC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; populations. Many TRPV1-cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons did not respond to capsaicin. In contrast, V1-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were in 4 groups, each of which was capsaicin-sensitive. Finally, none of the analyzed reporter lines showed &lt;i&gt;cre&lt;/i&gt;-recombination in trkB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, calbindin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, 70% of trkC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or parvalbumin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, which together encompassed ≈20% of Nav1.8-cre&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons. The data presented here increases our knowledge of peptidergic sensory neuron characteristics, while showing the efficiency and specificity manipulation of peptidergic neurons by the CGRP&lt;sup&gt;cre-ER&lt;/sup&gt; reporter. We also demonstrate that manipulation of all C- and A-nociceptors is better achieved with TRPV1-cre reporter. Finally, the described approach for detailed characterization of sensory neuronal groups can be applied to a variety of reporter mice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>fdb407f0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198601</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b794:3dd877af</id><author><name>Mayur J.

We propose an optoelectronic system for stimulation of living neurons. The system consists of an electronic circuit based on the FitzHugh–Nagumo model, an optical fiber, and a photoelectrical converter. We used this system for electrical stimulation of hippocampal living neurons in acute hippocampal brain slices (350-μm thick) obtained from a 20–28 days old C57BL/6 mouse or a Wistar rat. The main advantage of our system over other similar stimulators is that it contains an optical fiber for signal transmission instead of metallic wires. The fiber is placed between the electronic circuit and stimulated neurons and provides galvanic isolation from external electrical and magnetic fields. The use of the optical fiber allows avoiding electromagnetic noise and current flows which could affect metallic wires. Furthermore, it gives us the possibility to simulate “synaptic plasticity” by adaptive signal transfer through optical fiber. The proposed optoelectronic system (hybrid neural circuit) provides a very high efficiency in stimulating hippocampus neurons and can be used for restoring brain activity in particular regions or replacing brain parts (neuroprosthetics) damaged due to a trauma or neurodegenerative diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>d6ccead6</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198396</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8454e:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Mikhail A.

Inadequate care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and may be associated with adverse outcomes after dialysis. The nationwide pre-end-stage renal disease pay for performance program (P4P) has been implemented in Taiwan to improve quality of CKD care. However, the effectiveness of the P4P program in improving the outcomes of pre-dialysis care and dialysis is uncertain. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study. Patients who newly underwent long-term dialysis (≥3 mo) between 2007 and 2009 were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Based on the patient enrolment of the P4P program, they were categorized into P4P or non-P4P groups. We analysed pre-dialysis care, healthcare expenditures, and mortality between two groups. Among the 26 588 patients, 25.5% participated in the P4P program. The P4P group received significantly better quality of care, including a higher frequency of glomerular filtration rate measurement and CKD complications survey, a higher rate of vascular access preparation, and more frequent use of arteriovenous fistulas than the non-P4P group did. The P4P group had a 68.4% reduction of the 4-year total healthcare expenditure (excluding dialysis fee), which is equivalent to US$345.7 million, and a significant 22% reduction in three-year mortality after dialysis (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.75–0.82, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with the non-P4P group.

A new labeling reagent for vitamin analysis, 2-amino-10-ethyl acridine ketone (AEAO), has been synthesized and successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples. The reaction of AEAO with vitamins could proceed easily and quickly in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) as condensing reagent within 45 min. The derivatives exhibited excellent fluorescence property with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 430 nm, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to the optimization of pre-column derivatization. Solid phase extraction with HLB cartridges was used for the extraction and purification of water-soluble vitamins in tea samples. The LODs for vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 were 2.56 and 2.22 ng mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to obtain population norms and to assess test-retest reliability of EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF for the Indonesian population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A representative sample of 1056 people aged 17–75 years was recruited from the Indonesian general population. We used a multistage stratified quota sampling method with respect to residence, gender, age, education level, religion and ethnicity. Respondents completed EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF with help from an interviewer. Norms data for both instruments were reported. For the test-retest evaluations, a sub-sample of 206 respondents completed both instruments twice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The total sample and test-retest sub-sample were representative of the Indonesian general population. The EQ-5D-5L shows almost perfect agreement between the two tests (Gwet’s AC: 0.85–0.99 and percentage agreement: 90–99%) regarding the five dimensions. However, the agreement of EQ-VAS and index scores can be considered as poor (ICC: 0.45 and 0.37 respectively). For the WHOQOL-BREF, ICCs of the four domains were between 0.70 and 0.79, which indicates moderate to good agreement. For EQ-5D-5L, it was shown that female and older respondents had lower EQ-index scores, whilst rural, younger and higher-educated respondents had higher EQ-VAS scores. For WHOQOL-BREF: male, younger, higher-educated, high-income respondents had the highest scores in most of the domains, overall quality of life, and health satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study provides representative estimates of self-reported health status and quality of life for the general Indonesian population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L and WHOQOL-BREF instruments. The descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L and the WHOQOL-BREF have high test-retest reliability while the EQ-VAS and the index score of EQ-5D-5L show poor agreement between the two tests. Our results can be useful to researchers and clinicians who can compare their findings with respect to these concepts with those of the Indonesian general population.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>832143f1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197098</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f75:2835af05</id><author><name>Fredrick Dermawan Purba</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fredrick Dermawan Purba, Joke A.

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by inter-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>582b2a9d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006188</link><crawled>1526935170348</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163846dad2c:e40dc:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Linda Dib</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;

The dopamine (DA) hypothesis of cognitive deficits suggests that too low or too high extracellular DA concentration in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can severely impair the working memory (WM) maintenance during delay period. Thus, there exists only an optimal range of DA where the sustained-firing activity, the neural correlate of WM maintenance, in the cortex possesses optimal firing frequency as well as robustness against noisy distractions. Empirical evidences demonstrate changes even in the D1 receptor (D1R)-sensitivity to extracellular DA, collectively manifested through D1R density and DA-binding affinity, in the PFC under neuropsychiatric conditions such as ageing and schizophrenia. However, the impact of alterations in the cortical D1R-sensitivity on WM maintenance has yet remained poorly addressed. Using a quantitative neural mass model of the prefronto-mesoprefrontal system, the present study reveals that higher D1R-sensitivity may not only effectuate shrunk optimal DA range but also shift of the range to lower concentrations. Moreover, higher sensitivity may significantly reduce the WM-robustness even within the optimal DA range and exacerbates the decline at abnormal DA levels. These findings project important clinical implications, such as dosage precision and variability of DA-correcting drugs across patients, and failure in acquiring healthy WM maintenance even under drug-controlled normal cortical DA levels.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>7645fa2b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198136</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c23:3dd877af</id><author><name>Melissa Reneaux</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa Reneaux, Rahul Gupta&lt;/p&gt;

Using data provided by a ride-hailing platform, this paper examines the factors that affect taxi driver response behavior to ride-hailing requests. The empirical investigation from a driver’s perspective is of great importance for ride-hailing service providers, given that approximately 40% of the hailing requests receive no response from any driver. To comprehensively understand taxi driver response behavior, we use a rich dataset to generate variables related to the spatio-temporal supply-demand intensities, the economic incentives, the requests’ and the drivers’ characteristics. The results show that drivers are more likely to respond to requests with economic incentives (especially a firm subsidy), and those with a lower spatio-temporal demand intensity or a higher spatio-temporal supply intensity. In addition, drivers are more likely to respond to requests involving rides covering a greater geographical distance and to those with a smaller number of repeated submissions. The drivers’ characteristics, namely, the number of requests received and the number of requests responded, however, have relatively little impacts on their response probability to the current request. Our findings contribute to the related literature and provide managerial implications for ride-hailing service providers.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>20335237</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198605</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0b7:2835af05</id><author><name>Ke Xu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ke Xu, Luping Sun, Jingchen Liu, Hansheng Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic drug, has activity in preclinical models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Potential mechanisms of action include degrading constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) or inhibiting other drug-resistance pathways (e.g., Wnt-signaling). Published pharmacokinetics data suggests that niclosamide has poor oral bioavailability, potentially limiting its use as a cancer drug. Therefore, we launched a Phase I study testing oral niclosamide in combination with enzalutamide, for longer and at higher doses than those used to treat helminthic infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a Phase I dose-escalation study testing oral niclosamide plus standard-dose enzalutamide in men with metastatic CRPC previously treated with abiraterone. Niclosamide was given three-times-daily (TID) at the following dose-levels: 500, 1000 or 1500mg. The primary objective was to assess safety. Secondary objectives, included measuring AR-V expression from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the AdnaTest assay, evaluating PSA changes and determining niclosamide’s pharmacokinetic profile.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;20 patients screened and 5 enrolled after passing all screening procedures. 13(65%) patients had detectable CTCs, but only one was AR-V+. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 3 patients on the 500mg TID cohort; however, both (N = 2) subjects on the 1000mg TID cohort experienced DLTs (prolonged grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; and colitis). The maximum plasma concentration ranged from 35.7–82 ng/mL and was not consistently above the minimum effective concentration in preclinical studies. There were no PSA declines in any enrolled subject. Because plasma concentrations at the maximum tolerated dose (500mg TID) were not consistently above the expected therapeutic threshold, the Data Safety Monitoring Board closed the study for futility.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Oral niclosamide could not be escalated above 500mg TID, and plasma concentrations were not consistently above the threshold shown to inhibit growth in CRPC models.

Background &lt;p&gt;Nursing notes have not been widely used in prediction models for clinical outcomes, despite containing rich information. Advances in natural language processing have made it possible to extract information from large scale unstructured data like nursing notes. This study extracted the sentiment—impressions and attitudes—of nurses, and examined how sentiment relates to 30-day mortality and survival.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study applied a sentiment analysis algorithm to nursing notes extracted from MIMIC-III, a public intensive care unit (ICU) database. A multiple logistic regression model was fitted to the data to correlate measured sentiment with 30-day mortality while controlling for gender, type of ICU, and SAPS-II score. The association between measured sentiment and 30-day mortality was further examined in assessing the predictive performance of sentiment score as a feature in a classifier, and in a survival analysis for different levels of measured sentiment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Nursing notes from 27,477 ICU patients, with an overall 30-day mortality of 11.02%, were extracted. In the presence of known predictors of 30-day mortality, mean sentiment polarity was a highly significant predictor in a multiple logistic regression model (Adjusted OR = 0.4626, p &amp;lt; 0.001, 95% CI: [0.4244, 0.5041]) and led to improved predictive accuracy (AUROC = 0.8189 versus 0.8092, 95% BCI of difference: [0.0070, 0.0126]). The Kaplan Meier survival curves showed that mean sentiment polarity quartiles are positively correlated with patient survival (log-rank test: p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study showed that quantitative measures of unstructured clinical notes, such as sentiment of clinicians, correlate with 30-day mortality and survival, thus can also serve as a predictor of patient outcomes in the ICU. Therefore, further research is warranted to study and make use of the wealth of data that clinical notes have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>2bd69d09</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198687</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:668335a:3dd877af</id><author><name>Ian E.

Fossil evidence indicates that modern assemblages of temperate nonmarine planktonic diatoms began near the middle/late Miocene boundary when the genus &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt;, an important constituent of lacustrine planktonic diatom assemblages during the early to middle Miocene, was replaced by genera of the family Stephanodiscaceae. This floral turnover has been confirmed in many regions of the world, except eastern Asia where taxonomic data about early and middle Miocene planktonic diatom assemblages have until recently been scarce. Our analysis of Lower and Middle Miocene lacustrine diatomaceous rocks in Japan confirms that species of nonmarine &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; were important constituents of lake phytoplankton there as well. The appearance of nonmarine &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; species near the beginning of the Miocene may have resulted from the introduction of euryhaline species into lacustrine environments during a highstand of sea level at that time. Similarly, it is possible that species of Stephanodiscaceae evolved from marine thalassiosiroid ancestors that invaded high latitude lacustrine environments during multiple Paleogene highstands, resulting in a polyphyletic origin of the family. The turnover from nonmarine &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; to Stephanodiscaceae genera near the middle/late Miocene boundary may be linked to a contemporaneous increase in silica concentrations in lakes caused by active volcanism, increased weathering of silicate rocks due to orogeny, and the expansion of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; grasslands. This turnover may also have been influenced by enhanced seasonal environmental changes in the euphotic zone caused by the initiation of monsoon conditions and a worldwide increase in meridional temperature gradients during the late Miocene. Morphological characteristics of Stephanodiscaceae genera, such as strutted processes and small size, suggest their species were better adapted to seasonal environmental changes than nonmarine species of &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; because of their superiority in floating and drifting capabilities and possibly metabolism, intrinsic growth rate, and reproductivity.

Background &lt;p&gt;Integrin α8 (ITGA8) heterodimerizes with integrin β1 and is highly expressed in stromal cells of the lung. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ+) cells constitute a major population of contractile myofibroblasts in the lung following bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Integrin α8β1 is upregulated in fibrotic foci in bleomycin-induced lung injury. However, the functional role of ITGA8 in fibrogenesis has not been characterized. In this study, we examined whether genetic deletion of ITGA8 from PDGFRβ+ cells in the lung altered fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pdgfrb-Cre/+;&lt;i&gt;Itga8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/-&lt;/sup&gt; or Pdgfrb-Cre/+;&lt;i&gt;Itga8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt; (Cre+) and control mice (Cre-) were used for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies. Primary cultures of PDGFRβ+ cells were exposed to TGFβ, followed by RNA isolation for qPCR. For &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies, Cre+ and Cre- mice were characterized at baseline and after bleomycin-induced fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;PDGFRβ-selected cells from Cre+ animals showed higher levels of &lt;i&gt;Col1a1&lt;/i&gt; expression after treatment with TGFβ.

That’s how it is in drug research, and how it is in science in general. The problems and questions we’re working on are bigger than any one nationality; we’re tackling these things as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s disquieting to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/584?rss=1&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. That article reports that the (quite nationalist) government in Hungary is causing trouble for universities there, specifically the Central European University, accusing it and some of its faculty members of being in the pay of opponents of the government. It’s especially sad to see the national science funding agency participate in such actions. Hungarian scientists were a profound influence on the 20th century; the country produced a run of mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and chemists that had colleagues at Los Alamos joking that they must be Martians in disguise. But they didn’t get to that point by trying to do only Pure Hungarian Research, because there’s no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than there is Pure American, Pure German, or Pure Chinese Research.A look at what Germany did to its own scientific establishment under the National Socialist government should be all that’s needed as an argument, but apparently not. These things are dangerous fantasies, because talent comes from everywhere (and it often doesn’t conform to any given government’s ideology, either). I have a strong feeling that the current Hungarian government would be denouncing John von Neumann as a secret agent of George Soros were he or his like alive today. And they’re doing their best to make sure that the country never produces another such figure, which is a loss for the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/china-to-roll-back-regulations-for-traditional-medicine-despite-safety-concerns-1.23038&quot;&gt;Here’s another example&lt;/a&gt; of nationalism at work, this time in drug research. The Chinese government is apparently planning to drop requirements for safety and efficacy testing of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies. Xi Jinping himself is a big advocate, and what more do you need? Students who want to become TCM practitioners no longer need to pass the national medical exam to open their practices. Not only are these preparations getting easy regulatory treatment – the government is making it harder and harder for anyone to express any contrary opinions about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With strong government support for the alternative medicines industry, Chinese censors have been quick to remove posts from the Internet that question its efficacy. On 23 October, an article on a medical news site that called for closer attention to the risks of aristolochic acid was removed from social media site WeChat. The story had been viewed more than 700,000 times in three days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debate over TCMs has been silenced before in China. Last year, a Beijing think tank — the Development Research Center of the State Council — proposed banning the practice of extracting Asiatic black bear bile, another common ingredient in TCMs. The think tank’s report questioned the remedy’s efficacy and suggested using synthetic alternatives. It was removed from the think tank’s website after the Chinese Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which supports the development of TCM, called it biased and demanded an apology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04886-8&quot;&gt;go to jail&lt;/a&gt; for criticizing this stuff. Now, I think the way that the US regulates (or doesn’t regulate) “dietary supplements” &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/11/04/the_herbal_supplement_industry_is_not_a_very_funny_joke&quot;&gt;is a disgrace&lt;/a&gt;, but this is insanely worse. China has a great many excellent scientists, in a great many fields, and in drug research in particular they’re working on joining the short list of countries who have their own research-based drug industry that can produce new therapies to help patients around the world. But this effort will not be aided by making it easier for the black bear bile industry. I leave aside for another time discussion of how some of these “remedies” are driving animals around the world to extinction, but that’s just another argument for actually seeing if any of these things work (or even cause actual harm instead), and &lt;em&gt;taking them off the market&lt;/em&gt; if they don’t. But the Chinese government has made the cynical calculation that promoting this stuff will pay off politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? There’s a connection between these two examples. Guess what the Hungarian government is interested in promoting? Traditional Chinese medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government spokespeople declined to answer specific questions about CEU, but did address another flash point: the country’s growing embrace of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). On 16 April, Hungary’s University of Szeged signed an agreement with the Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine in Xianyang, China, to bring TCM researchers, medical experts, and lecturers to teach in the region. The University of Pécs in Hungary has had a similar arrangement since 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year, the Hungarian government also announced plans to allocate about €4.5 million ($5.3 million) to build a new institute with a whole floor dedicated to TCM at Semmelweis University, one of the most prestigious medical schools in Hungary. The government says it wants to bridge the gap between Western medicine and Eastern alternatives to improve Hungarian health care, and also strengthen the economic, political, and cultural ties between Hungary and China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess that the most important word in that last sentence is “economic”. It’s pretty strange to see the Hungarian government deciding that the honor of Hungary has to be protected by embracing Chinese herbal remedies, but I’m sure that there are plenty of idiotic speeches laying this connection out in soul-eroding detail. No, this sort of thing is bad news. The reason science works is that we ask questions, investigate them to the best of our abilities, and build on the results that we get &lt;em&gt;whether we like them or not&lt;/em&gt;. Wishful thinking doesn’t work so well. The physical world does what it does independent of anyone’s political agenda or nationalist sloganeering, and pretending otherwise is shameful and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>78</engagement><published>1526042727000</published><fingerprint>9bff70fd</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13530</link><crawled>1526043198836</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1634f434574:1c26329:2835af05</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>I would guess that, at this point, I’ve worked with people from every region of the planet except Greenland and Antarctica.

The aim of this study was to examine eye movements and postural control performance among dyslexic children while reading a text and performing the Landolt reading task. Fifteen dyslexic and 15 non-dyslexic children were asked to stand upright while performing two experimental visual tasks: text reading and Landolt reading. In the text reading task, children were asked to silently read a text displayed on a monitor, while in the Landolt reading task, the letters in the text were replaced by closed circles and Landolt rings, and children were asked to scan each circle/ring in a reading-like fashion, from left to right, and to count the number of Landolt rings. Eye movements (Mobile T2&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SuriCog) and center of pressure excursions (Framiral&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, Grasse, France) were recorded. Visual performance variables were total reading time, mean duration of fixation, number of pro- and retro-saccades, and amplitude of pro-saccades. Postural performance variable was the center of pressure area. The results showed that dyslexic children spent more time reading the text and had a longer duration of fixation than non-dyslexic children. However, no difference was observed between dyslexic and non-dyslexic children in the Landolt reading task. Dyslexic children performed a higher number of pro- and retro-saccades than non-dyslexic children in both text reading and Landolt reading tasks. Dyslexic children had smaller pro-saccade amplitude than non-dyslexic children in the text reading task. Finally, postural performance was poorer in dyslexic children than in non-dyslexic children. Reading difficulties in dyslexic children are related to eye movement strategies required to scan and obtain lexical and semantic meaning. However, postural control performance, which was poor in dyslexic children, is not related to lexical and semantic reading requirements and might not also be related to different eye movement behavior.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>a609e40b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198001</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e31:2835af05</id><author><name>Milena Razuk</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Milena Razuk, José Angelo Barela, Hugo Peyre, Christophe Loic Gerard, Maria Pia Bucci&lt;/p&gt;
The aim of this study was to examine eye movements and postural control performance among dyslexic children while reading a text and performing the Landolt reading task. Fifteen dyslexic and 15 non-dyslexic children were asked to stand upright while performing two experimental visual tasks: text reading and Landolt reading. In the text reading task, children were asked to silently read a text displayed on a monitor, while in the Landolt reading task, the letters in the text were replaced by closed circles and Landolt rings, and children were asked to scan each circle/ring in a reading-like fashion, from left to right, and to count the number of Landolt rings. Eye movements (Mobile T2&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SuriCog) and center of pressure excursions (Framiral&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, Grasse, France) were recorded. Visual performance variables were total reading time, mean duration of fixation, number of pro- and retro-saccades, and amplitude of pro-saccades. Postural performance variable was the center of pressure area. The results showed that dyslexic children spent more time reading the text and had a longer duration of fixation than non-dyslexic children. However, no difference was observed between dyslexic and non-dyslexic children in the Landolt reading task. Dyslexic children performed a higher number of pro- and retro-saccades than non-dyslexic children in both text reading and Landolt reading tasks. Dyslexic children had smaller pro-saccade amplitude than non-dyslexic children in the text reading task. Finally, postural performance was poorer in dyslexic children than in non-dyslexic children. Reading difficulties in dyslexic children are related to eye movement strategies required to scan and obtain lexical and semantic meaning.

Recent studies indicate that lifestyle factors in early life affect breast cancer risk. We therefore explored the association of high consumption of meat, milk, and whole grain products in adolescence and midlife, on breast cancer risk. We used data from the population based AGES-Reykjavik cohort (2002–2006), where 3,326 women with a mean age of 77 years (SD 6.0) participated. For food items and principal component derived dietary patterns we used Cox proportional models to calculate multivariate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). During a mean follow-up of 8.8 years, 97 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. For both adolescence and midlife, daily consumption of rye bread was positively associated with breast cancer (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–2.9, respectively). In contrast, persistent high consumption of oatmeal was negatively associated with breast cancer (0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.9). No association was found for other food items or dietary patterns that included rye bread. High rye bread consumption in adolescence and midlife may increase risk of late-life breast cancer whilst persistent consumption of oatmeal may reduce the risk.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>8db0474d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198017</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb91a:3dd877af</id><author><name>Alfheidur Haraldsdottir</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfheidur Haraldsdottir, Johanna E.

A plantation of 5-year-old poplar &lt;i&gt;Populus × euramericana cv&lt;/i&gt;. ‘Neva’ was used to study the regulatory effects of root pruning on nutrients, photosynthetic characteristics, and water-use efficiency (WUE) of leaves and growth rates of diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.3 m), tree height, and volume. Six root-pruning treatments were conducted with different combinations of intensity (at a distance of six, eight or ten times DBH from the trunk) and orientation (on two or four sides of the trees). Results showed that the N, P, K, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance of leaves were all significantly decreased by root pruning over the initial period following root pruning (30 days), but increased in the subsequent investigations. The values of the above indexes peaked in 8–2 treatment (i.e., eight times DBH distance on two sides). The leaf WUE in 8–2 treatment, and average growth rates of DBH, tree height and volume, were the highest among all treatments within 3 years of root pruning. The results indicated that the root pruning based on the appropriate selection of intensity and orientation had significant positive effects on leaf nutrients, photosynthesis, and growth of trees in a closed-canopy poplar plantation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>1eeeac98</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197515</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122c:93d646dc</id><author><name>Da-wei Jing</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Da-wei Jing, Zhen-yu Du, Ming-you Wang, Qing-hua Wang, Hai-lin Ma, Fang-chun Liu, Bing-yao Ma, Yu-feng Dong&lt;/p&gt;

To avoid a global collapse in our ability to control fungal infections and to avoid critical failures in medicine and food security, we must improve our stewardship of extant chemicals, promote new antifungal discovery, and leverage emerging technologies for alternative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/739?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328559v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>Exploring the impact of inoculum dose on host immunity and morbidity to inform model-based vaccine design [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/22/328559</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328559v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Background: Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used.

We used the model to predict the level of immune protection and morbidity for different inoculum doses and to explore what an optimal inoculum dose might be. Results: We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. We find that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity depends on the pathogen and both protection and morbidity do not always increase with increasing inoculum dose. An intermediate inoculum dose can provide the best balance between immune protection and morbidity, though this depends on the specific weighting of protection and morbidity.

Primates sample their visual environment actively through saccades and microsaccades (MSs). Saccadic eye movements not only modulate neural spike rates but might also affect temporal correlations (synchrony) among neurons. Neural synchrony plays a role in neural coding and modulates information transfer between cortical areas. The question arises of how eye movements shape neural synchrony within and across cortical areas and how it affects visual processing. Through local field recordings in macaque early visual cortex while monitoring eye position and through neural network simulations, we find 2 distinct synchrony regimes in early visual cortex that are embedded in a 3- to 4-Hz MS-related rhythm during visual fixation. In the period shortly after an MS (“transient period”), synchrony was high within and between cortical areas. In the subsequent period (“sustained period”), overall synchrony dropped and became selective to stimulus properties. Only mutually connected neurons with similar stimulus responses exhibited sustained narrow-band gamma synchrony (25–80 Hz), both within and across cortical areas. Recordings in macaque V1 and V2 matched the model predictions. Furthermore, our modeling provides predictions on how (micro)saccade-modulated gamma synchrony in V1 shapes V2 receptive fields (RFs). We suggest that the rhythmic alternation between synchronization regimes represents a basic repeating sampling strategy of the visual system.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OJjb-Xb_Rf8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>d52fcdd0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004132</link><crawled>1527789422282</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163b75886ca:c89e2:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Eric Lowet</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Lowet, Bart Gips, Mark J.

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>72055f13</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196866</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed5:2835af05</id><author><name>Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, we analyze first whether there is a common spatial distribution of child maltreatment (CM) and intimate partner violence (IPV), and second, whether the risks of CM and IPV are influenced by the same neighborhood characteristics, and if these risks spatially overlap. To this end we used geocoded data of CM referrals (N = 588) and IPV incidents (N = 1450) in the city of Valencia (Spain). As neighborhood proxies, we used 552 census block groups. Neighborhood characteristics analyzed at the aggregated level (census block groups) were: Neighborhood concentrated disadvantage (neighborhood economic status, neighborhood education level, and policing activity), immigrant concentration, and residential instability. A Bayesian joint modeling approach was used to examine the spatial distribution of CM and IPV, and a Bayesian random-effects modeling approach was used to analyze the influence of neighborhood-level characteristics on small-area variations of CM and IPV risks. For CM, 98% of the total between-area variation in risk was captured by a shared spatial component, while for IPV the shared component was 77%. The risks of CM and IPV were higher in neighborhoods characterized by lower levels of economic status and education, and higher levels of policing activity, immigrant concentration, and residential instability. The correlation between the log relative risk of CM and IPV was .85. Most census block groups had either low or high risks in both outcomes (with only 10.5% of the areas with mismatched risks). These results show that certain neighborhood characteristics are associated with an increase in the risk of family violence, regardless of whether this violence is against children or against intimate partners. Identifying these high-risk areas can inform a more integrated community-level response to both types of family violence. Future research should consider a community-level approach to address both types of family violence, as opposed to individual-level intervention addressing each type of violence separately.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>6155a1b0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198684</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:6683358:3dd877af</id><author><name>Enrique Gracia</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enrique Gracia, Antonio López-Quílez, Miriam Marco, Marisol Lila&lt;/p&gt;

The invasive yellow-legged hornet, &lt;i&gt;Vespa velutina nigrithorax&lt;/i&gt; Lepeletier, 1836 (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), is native to Southeast Asia. It was first detected in France (in the southwest) in 2005. It has since expanded throughout Europe and has caused significant harm to honeybee populations. We must better characterize the hornet’s flight capacity to understand the species’ success and develop improved control strategies. Here, we carried out a study in which we quantified the flight capacities of &lt;i&gt;V. velutina&lt;/i&gt; workers using computerized flight mills. We observed that workers were able to spend around 40% of the daily 7-hour flight tests flying. On average, they flew 10km to 30km during each flight test, although there was a large amount of variation. Workers sampled in early summer had lower flight capacities than workers sampled later in the season. Flight capacity decreased as workers aged. However, in the field, workers probably often die before this decrease becomes significant. During each flight test, workers performed several continuous flight phases of variable length that were separated by rest phases. Based on the length of those continuous flight phases and certain key assumptions, we estimated that &lt;i&gt;V. velutina&lt;/i&gt; colony foraging radius is at least 700 m (half that in early summer); however, some workers are able to forage much farther. While these laboratory findings remain to be confirmed by field studies, our results can nonetheless help inform &lt;i&gt;V. velutina&lt;/i&gt; biology and control efforts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>918f05f1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198597</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0b5:2835af05</id><author><name>Daniel Sauvard</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Sauvard, Vanessa Imbault, Éric Darrouzet&lt;/p&gt;

BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1–10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>91</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>fcf2691b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005998</link><crawled>1525975049460</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e37:abeb7260</id><author><name>Arturo Blazquez-Navarro</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arturo Blazquez-Navarro, Thomas Schachtner, Ulrik Stervbo, Anett Sefrin, Maik Stein, Timm H.

People who have been advocating this for years will now get a chance to see how it works out in practice – and in fact, I would encourage them to go ahead and put down some predictions about what they think might happen. Predicting that not much will change, or that it will be hard to notice the effects, etc., is not (to my mind) a particularly good answer for supporters of this approach, because one then wonders why it was worth going to the trouble at all. But I’m not a supporter, so that’s my prediction: little change, with potential for harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/10/right_to_try_here_we_go&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/20/stem_cells_the_center_of_right_to_try&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt; many times before, but in case my views aren’t clear, here we go: I think Right to Try laws are largely useless, and have the potential to cause actual harm disproportionate to the good they might do. I think that there are sincere, principled advocates for them, but at the same time, there are many people on that side of the issue who are either ill-informed about medical research or who are simply grandstanding for votes and popular support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, my biggest reasons for thinking this way are: (1) most investigational drugs don’t work. The failure rate in human clinical trials is around 90 per cent, and it’s been that way for a long time. (2) there are disease areas where a tragedy-of-the-commons situation will mean that controlled clinical trials (which are still the only way to determine if a new drug works) will be much more difficult to run under a “why wait for proof?” system (I have to note that the current bill restricts right-to-try to those patients who are ineligible for clinical trials, which is a good provision). (3) opening up unproven therapies could lead to a moral hazard, where it becomes lucrative to put useless-but-harmless “drug candidates” into “clinical trials” so you can charge desperate patients at “cost”. I mean every quotation mark in that last sentence. I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-24/right-to-try-drug-law-risks-exploiting-desperate-patients&quot;&gt;not the only person&lt;/a&gt; who thinks this way. My own suggestion for the last point has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dereklowe/status/826761000032600064&quot;&gt;already been made&lt;/a&gt;: antioxidant phytonutrients – i.e., dried grape juice pills – for Alzheimer’s. Won’t do a thing, but hey, you have the right to try ’em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/372440-hundreds-sign-on-to-letter-opposing-right-to-try-drug-bill&quot;&gt;empirical evidence&lt;/a&gt; for all of these positions. Many states have passed their own right-to-try laws (in various forms), and if there has been any decrease in human suffering or advance in medical knowledge through them, I have missed it. To get specific, when Colorado passed its own law in 2014, one of the first companies that announced plans to offer treatments under its provisions was a stem-cell company, Neuralstem. And guess what? None of their treatments &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4094360-neuralstem-doomed&quot;&gt;ever worked&lt;/a&gt;. Most things don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, I’m inclined to put this current legislation in the “grandstanding” category. That’s because, as I understand it, there are no provisions that any given company has to provide such an experimental drug for use. It might be better named “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/right-to-try-bill-passes-trump-to-sign-will-it-help-terminally-ill-patients/&quot;&gt;right to ask&lt;/a&gt;“, and the compassionate-use program already provides just that. What’s changed? Well, now that we have a brand new federal law, all sorts of politicians will be able to talk about how they brought lifesaving therapies directly to critically ill patients, shook up the horrible drug approval process, struck a blow for the common people and stuck it to the drug companies, and on and on. Not always a very instructive spectacle, politics.

Over the past decade, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO) has been increasingly utilized in respiratory failure in patients. This study presents our institution´s experience focusing on the life span of ECMO systems reflecting the performance of a particular system. A retrospective review of our ECMO database identified 461 adult patients undergoing vvECMO (2010–2017). Patients that required more than one system and survived the first exchange &gt;24 hours (n = 139) were included. Life span until the first exchange and exchange criteria were analyzed for all systems (PLS, Cardiohelp HLS-set, both Maquet Cardiopulmonary, Rastatt, Germany; Deltastream/Hilite7000LT, iLA-activve, Xenios/NovaLung, Heilbronn, Germany; ECC.O5, LivaNova, Mirandola, Italy). At our ECMO center, the frequency of a system exchange was 30%. The median (IQR) life span was 9 (6–12) days. There was no difference regarding the different systems (p = 0.145 and p = 0.108, respectively). However, the Deltastream systems were exchanged more frequently due to elective technical complications (e. g. worsened gas transfer, development of coagulation disorder, increased bleedings complications) compared to the other exchanged systems (p = 0.013). In summary, the used ECMO systems are safe and effective for acute respiratory failure. There is no evidence for the usage of a specific system. Only the increased predictability of an imminent exchange preferred the usage of a Deltastream system. However, the decision to use a particular system should not depend solely on the possible criteria for an exchange.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>2f73630d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198392</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8454d:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Alois Philipp</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alois Philipp, Filip De Somer, Maik Foltan, Andre Bredthauer, Lars Krenkel, Florian Zeman, Karla Lehle&lt;/p&gt;

These findings provide necessary background against which the effects of other evolutionary forces, most importantly natural selection, can be interpreted.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00204</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Catalyst-Controlled Stereodivergent Synthesis of Atropisomeric Multiaxis Systems</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00204/20180425/images/medium/oc-2018-002047_0008.gif</url><height>286</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00204</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00204/20180425/images/medium/oc-2018-002047_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00204&lt;/div&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525838400000</published><fingerprint>c73469cd</fingerprint><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00204</link><crawled>1525869170705</crawled><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_16344e3d011:19b43dd:abeb7260</id><author><name>Dominik Lotter, Alessandro Castrogiovanni, Markus Neuburger, Christof Sparr</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.8b00204/20180425/images/medium/oc-2018-002047_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00204&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197824</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Quantification of chemical and mechanical bioerosion rates of six Caribbean excavating sponge species found on the coral reefs of Curaçao</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197824</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197824</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Didier M. de Bakker, Alice E.

Excavating sponges are among the most important macro-eroders of carbonate substrates in marine systems. Their capacity to remove substantial amounts of limestone makes these animals significant players that can unbalance the reef carbonate budget of tropical coral reefs. Nevertheless, excavating sponges are currently rarely incorporated in standardized surveys and experimental work is often restricted to a few species. Here were provide chemical and mechanical bioerosion rates for the six excavating sponge species most commonly found on the shallow reef of Curaçao (southern Caribbean): &lt;i&gt;Cliona caribbaea&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aprica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;delitrix&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;amplicavata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Siphonodictyon brevitubulatum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Suberea flavolivescens&lt;/i&gt;. Chemical, mechanical and total bioerosion rates were estimated based on various experimental approaches applied to sponge infested limestone cores. Conventional standing incubation techniques were shown to strongly influence the chemical dissolution signal. Final rates, based on the change in alkalinity of the incubation water, declined significantly as a function of incubation time. This effect was mitigated by the use of a flow-through incubation system. Additionally, we found that mechanically removed carbonate fragments collected in the flow-through chamber (1 h) as well as a long-term collection method (1 wk) generally yielded comparable estimates for the capacity of these sponges to mechanically remove substratum. Observed interspecific variation could evidently be linked to the adopted boring strategy (i.e. gallery-forming, cavity-forming or network-working) and presence or absence of symbiotic zooxanthellae. Notably, a clear diurnal pattern was found only in species that harbour a dense photosymbiotic community. In these species chemical erosion was substantially higher during the day. Overall, the sum of individually acquired chemical and mechanical erosion using flow-through incubations was comparable to rates obtained gravimetrically. Such consistency is a first in this field of research. These findings support the much needed confirmation that, depending on the scientific demand, the different approaches presented here can be implemented concurrently as standardized methods.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>cc8fc3f7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197824</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb914:3dd877af</id><author><name>Didier M. de Bakker</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Didier M. de Bakker, Alice E.

The potential use of bone progenitors, multipotential stromal cells (MSCs) helping spine fusion is increasing, but convenient MSC sources and effective processing methods are critical factors yet to be optimised. The aim of this study was to test the effect of bone marrow processing on the MSC abundance and to compare the differentiation capabilities of vertebral body-bone marrow (VB-BM) MSCs versus iliac crest-bone marrow (IC-BM) MSCs. We assessed the effect of the red blood cell lysis (ammonium chloride, AC) and density-gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep™, LMP), on the extracted VB-BM and IC-BM MSC numbers. The MSC abundance (indicated by colony counts and CD45&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD271&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cell numbers), phenotype, proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation of VB-BM MSCs were compared with donor-matched IC-BM MSCs. Importantly, the MSC attachment and osteogenesis were examined when VB-BM and IC-BM samples were loaded on a beta-tricalcium phosphate scaffold. In contrast to LMP, using AC yielded more colonies from IC-BM and VB-BM aspirates (p = 0.0019 &amp;amp; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0201 respectively). For IC-BM and VB-BM, the colony counts and CD45&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt;CD271&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cell numbers were comparable (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5186, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.2640 respectively). Furthermore, cultured VB-BM MSCs exhibited the same phenotype, proliferative and adipogenic potential, but a higher osteogenic and chondrogenic capabilities than IC-BM MSCs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0010 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005 for calcium and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels, respectively). The gene expression data confirmed higher chondrogenesis for VB-BM MSCs than IC-BM MSCs, but osteogenic gene expression levels were comparable. When loaded on Vitoss™, both MSCs showed a similar degree of attachment and survival, but a better osteogenic ability was detected for VB-BM MSCs as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0386). Collectively, the BM processing using AC had more MSC yield than using LMP. VB-BM MSCs have a comparable phenotype and proliferative capacity, but higher chondrogenesis and osteogenesis with or without using scaffold than donor-matched IC-BM MSCs. Given better accessibility, VB-BM could be an ideal MSC source for spinal bone fusion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>18d49064</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197969</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2e:2835af05</id><author><name>Evangelos M.

&lt;i&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal mushroom that is well known for its ability to enhance human health, and products made from this fungus have been highly profitable. The substrate-degrading ability of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; could be related to its growth. CAZy proteins were more abundant in its genome than in the other white rot fungi models. Among these CAZy proteins, changes in lignocellulolytic enzymes during growth have not been well studied. Using genomic, transcriptomic and secretomic analyses, this study focuses on the lignocellulolytic enzymes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; strain G0119 to determine which of these degradative enzymes contribute to its growth. From the genome sequencing data, genes belonging to CAZy protein families, especially genes involved in lignocellulose degradation, were investigated. The gene expression, protein abundance and enzymatic activity of lignocellulolytic enzymes in mycelia over a growth cycle were analysed. The overall expression cellulase was higher than that of hemicellulase and lignin-modifying enzymes, particularly during the development of fruiting bodies. The cellulase and hemicellulase abundances and activities increased after the fruiting bodies matured, when basidiospores were produced in massive quantities till the end of the growth cycle. Additionally, the protein abundances of the lignin-modifying enzymes and the expression of their corresponding genes, including laccases and lignin-degrading heme peroxidases, were highest when the mycelia fully spread in the compost bag. Type I cellobiohydrolase was observed to be the most abundant extracellular lignocellulolytic enzyme produced by the &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; strain G0119. The AA2 family haem peroxidases were the dominant lignin-modifying enzyme expressed during the mycelial growth phase, and several laccases might play roles during the formation of the primordium. This study provides insight into the changes in the lignocellulose degradation ability of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; during its growth and will facilitate the discovery of new approaches to accelerate the growth of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; in culture.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>bf1441f3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198404</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b954:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Shuai Zhou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shuai Zhou, Jingsong Zhang, Fuying Ma, Chuanhong Tang, Qingjiu Tang, Xiaoyu Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The AA2 family haem peroxidases were the dominant lignin-modifying enzyme expressed during the mycelial growth phase, and several laccases might play roles during the formation of the primordium. This study provides insight into the changes in the lignocellulose degradation ability of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; during its growth and will facilitate the discovery of new approaches to accelerate the growth of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; in culture.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027487?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Blurring out hydrogen: The dynamical structure of teflic acid</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027487?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/19&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 19&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526874143000</published><fingerprint>8d18e418</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027487?af=R</link><crawled>1526981725661</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16387340ddd:6c0879c:93d646dc</id><author><name>S.

Objective &lt;p&gt;In the liver, a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH) is oxidative stress, which leads to the accumulation of highly reactive electrophilic α/β unsaturated aldehydes. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of NASH on protein carbonylation and antioxidant responses in a murine model.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Liver-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deletion mice (PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt;) or control littermates were fed a standard chow diet for 45–55 weeks followed by analysis for liver injury, oxidative stress and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Histology and Picrosirius red-staining of collagen deposition within the extracellular matrix revealed extensive steatosis and fibrosis in the PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice but no steatosis or fibrosis in controls. Increased steatosis and fibrosis corresponded with significant increases in inflammation. PTEN-deficient livers showed significantly increased cell-specific oxidative damage, as detected by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and acrolein staining. Elevated staining correlated with an increase in nuclear DNA repair foci (γH2A.X) and cellular proliferation index (Ki67) within zones 1 and 3, indicating oxidative damage was zonally restricted and was associated with increased DNA damage and cell proliferation. Immunoblots showed that total levels of antioxidant response proteins induced by nuclear factor erythroid-2-like-2 (Nrf2), including GSTμ, GSTπ and CBR1/3, but not HO-1, were elevated in PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; as compared to controls, and IHC showed this response also occurred only in zones 1 and 3. Furthermore, an analysis of autophagy markers revealed significant elevation of p62 and LC3II expression. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis identified significantly more carbonylated proteins in whole cell extracts prepared from PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice (966) as compared to controls (809). Pathway analyses of identified proteins did not uncover specific pathways that were preferentially carbonylated in PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; livers but, did reveal specific strongly increased carbonylation of thioredoxin reductase and of glutathione-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-transferases (GST) M6, O1, and O2.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Results show that disruption of PTEN resulted in steatohepatitis, fibrosis and caused hepatic induction of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant system at least in part due to elevation of p62. This response was both cell-type and zone specific.

Background &lt;p&gt;Animal bites and stings contribute significantly to mortality in certain parts of the world. India accounts for the highest number of snakebites and related mortality globally. We report on mortality due to bite or sting of a venomous animal from a population-based study in the Indian state of Bihar which estimated the causes of death using verbal autopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/principal findings &lt;p&gt;Interviews were conducted for all deaths that occurred from January 2012 to March 2014 in 109,689 households (87.1% participation) covering 627,658 population in 1,017 clusters representative of the state using the Population Health Metrics Research Consortium shortened verbal autopsy questionnaire. Cause of death was assigned using the SmartVA automated algorithm. The annualized mortality rate per 100,000 population due to snakebite, scorpion sting and other animals adjusted for age, sex and urban-rural population distribution of the state; and detailed contextual information on snakebites are reported. Deaths due to bite/sting of a venomous animal accounted for 10.7% of all deaths due to unintentional injuries, with an adjusted mortality rate of 6.2 (95% CI 6.0–6.3) per 100,000 population. The adjusted snakebite mortality rate was 4.4 (95% CI 4.3–4.6) which was significantly higher in the rural areas (4.8, 95% CI 4.7–5.0) and in females (5.5, 95% CI 5.3–5.7).

Background &lt;p&gt;Animal bites and stings contribute significantly to mortality in certain parts of the world. India accounts for the highest number of snakebites and related mortality globally. We report on mortality due to bite or sting of a venomous animal from a population-based study in the Indian state of Bihar which estimated the causes of death using verbal autopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/principal findings &lt;p&gt;Interviews were conducted for all deaths that occurred from January 2012 to March 2014 in 109,689 households (87.1% participation) covering 627,658 population in 1,017 clusters representative of the state using the Population Health Metrics Research Consortium shortened verbal autopsy questionnaire. Cause of death was assigned using the SmartVA automated algorithm. The annualized mortality rate per 100,000 population due to snakebite, scorpion sting and other animals adjusted for age, sex and urban-rural population distribution of the state; and detailed contextual information on snakebites are reported. Deaths due to bite/sting of a venomous animal accounted for 10.7% of all deaths due to unintentional injuries, with an adjusted mortality rate of 6.2 (95% CI 6.0–6.3) per 100,000 population. The adjusted snakebite mortality rate was 4.4 (95% CI 4.3–4.6) which was significantly higher in the rural areas (4.8, 95% CI 4.7–5.0) and in females (5.5, 95% CI 5.3–5.7). Snakebites accounted for 7.6% of all unintentional injury deaths across all ages but for 33.3% of the deaths in 10–14 years age group.

Important cellular processes such as migration, differentiation, and development often rely on precise timing. Yet, the molecular machinery that regulates timing is inherently noisy. How do cells achieve precise timing with noisy components? We investigate this question using a first-passage-time approach, for an event triggered by a molecule that crosses an abundance threshold and that is regulated by either an accumulating activator or a diminishing repressor. We find that either activation or repression outperforms an unregulated strategy. The optimal regulation corresponds to a nonlinear increase in the amount of the target molecule over time, arises from a tradeoff between minimizing the timing noise of the regulator and that of the target molecule itself, and is robust to additional effects such as bursts and cell division. Our results are in quantitative agreement with the nonlinear increase and low noise of &lt;i&gt;mig-1&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in migrating neuroblast cells during &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; development. These findings suggest that dynamic regulation may be a simple and powerful strategy for precise cellular timing.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5cQl5NSCSNQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>7acc4cd0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006201</link><crawled>1528393408162</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163db589ea2:44434e:c2c34441</id><author><name>Shivam Gupta</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shivam Gupta, Julien Varennes, Hendrik C.

Source analyses on event related potentials (ERPs) derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) were performed to examine the respective roles of cortical areas preceding exogenously triggered saccades, combined convergences, and combined divergences. All eye movements were triggered by the offset of a central fixation light emitting diode (LED) and the onset of a lateral LED at various depths in an otherwise fully darkened room. Our analyses revealed that three source pairs, two located in the frontal lobe–the frontal eye fields (FEF) and an anterior frontal area–, and one located within the occipital cortex, can account for 99.2% of the observed ERPs. Overall, the comparison between source activities revealed the largest activity in the occipital cortex, while no difference in activity between FEF and the anterior frontal area was obtained. For all sources, increased activity was observed for combined vergences, especially combined convergences, relative to saccades. Behavioral results revealed that onset latencies were longest for combined convergences, intermediate for combined divergences, and the shortest for saccades. Together, these findings fit within a perspective in which both occipital and frontal areas play an important role in retinal disparity detection. In the case of saccades and combined divergences stimulus-locked activity was larger than response-locked activity, while no difference between stimulus- and response-locked activity was observed for combined convergences. These findings seem to imply that the electrophysiological activity preceding exogenous eye movements consists of a sensory-related part that is under cortical control, while subcortical structures may be held responsible for final execution.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>1d49a18d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198405</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0ab:2835af05</id><author><name>Monika Wojtczak-Kwaśniewska</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Monika Wojtczak-Kwaśniewska, Anna Przekoracka-Krawczyk, Rob H.

Pigeon racing is a popular sport worldwide. Pigeons are under continuous selection to improve speed, spatial orientation, and endurance during long flights. However, numerous genetic and non-genetic factors affect survivability and homing ability, making such traits difficult for breeders to control. Polymorphisms in the lactate dehydrogenase A gene (&lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt;) likely affects pigeon racing and homing abilities, due to its role in physical and mental performance. Additionally, the adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt;) has been associated with physiological and behavioral shifts that occur during avian migration. In this study, we examined the association between &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; genotypes with pigeon survivability during racing competitions. Survivability was evaluated through the estimated breeding value (EBV) of each individual’s total race distances during its athletic life. &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; was not polymorphic among our samples, while &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes were significantly associated with deviated EBV values of longer total race distance; individuals carrying the &lt;i&gt;S+&lt;/i&gt; genotype had higher EBV (i.e., greater survivability). Thus, the &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; locus might be useful for marker-assisted selection, empowering breeders and trainers to maximize pigeon quality. Moreover, data obtained from breeding will also improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying navigation and flight for wild migrating bird species.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>559650b6</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</link><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7216:2835af05</id><author><name>Sherif Ramadan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sherif Ramadan, Takeshi Miyake, Junichi Yamaura, Miho Inoue-Murayama&lt;/p&gt;

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can harm the embryonic development and cause life-long consequences in offspring’s health. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of PAE we have used a mouse model of early alcohol exposure, which is based on maternal &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; ingestion of 10% (v/v) ethanol for the first eight days of gestation (GD 0.5–8.5). Owing to the detected postnatal growth-restricted phenotype in the offspring of this mouse model and both prenatal and postnatal growth restriction in alcohol-exposed humans, we focused on imprinted genes &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like growth factor 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Igf2)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Paternally expressed gene 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Peg3)&lt;/i&gt;, which all are known to be involved in embryonic and placental growth and development. We studied the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation level at the &lt;i&gt;Igf2/H19&lt;/i&gt; imprinting control region (ICR), &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; differentially methylated region 1, &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; ICR and &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; ICR in 9.5 embryonic days old (E9.5) embryos and placentas by using MassARRAY EpiTYPER. To determine alcohol-induced alterations globally, we also examined methylation in long interspersed nuclear elements (Line-1) in E9.5 placentas. We did not observe any significant alcohol-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. We explored effects of PAE on gene expression of E9.5 embryos as well as E9.5 and E16.5 placentas by using quantitative PCR. The expression of growth promoter gene &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; was decreased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas. The expression of negative growth controller &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt; was significantly increased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos compared to controls, and conversely, a trend of decreased expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas were observed. Furthermore, increased &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos was also detected. Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>de22e66e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b90:93d646dc</id><author><name>Heidi Marjonen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi Marjonen, Mia Toivonen, Laura Lahti, Nina Kaminen-Ahola&lt;/p&gt;

This poses a challenge for tasks like text classification in languages other than English. In the absence of basic NLP tools, manually engineering features that capture semantic information of the documents is a potential solution. Nevertheless, it is very time consuming. Deep neural networks, particularly deep recurrent neural networks (RNN), have been proposed as End-to-End models that learn both features and parameters jointly, thus avoiding the need to manually encode the features. We compared the performance of two classifiers for labeling 14718 clinical notes in Spanish according to the patients&apos; smoking status: a bag-of-words model involving heavy manual feature engineering and a bidirectional long-short-term-memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural network (RNN) with GloVe word embeddings. The RNN slightly outperforms the bag-of-words model, but with 80% less overall development time.

In the absence of basic NLP tools, manually engineering features that capture semantic information of the documents is a potential solution. Nevertheless, it is very time consuming. Deep neural networks, particularly deep recurrent neural networks (RNN), have been proposed as End-to-End models that learn both features and parameters jointly, thus avoiding the need to manually encode the features. We compared the performance of two classifiers for labeling 14718 clinical notes in Spanish according to the patients&apos; smoking status: a bag-of-words model involving heavy manual feature engineering and a bidirectional long-short-term-memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural network (RNN) with GloVe word embeddings. The RNN slightly outperforms the bag-of-words model, but with 80% less overall development time. Such algorithms can facilitate the exploitation of clinical notes in languages in which NLP tools are not as developed as in English.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318881v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>AI-MHC: an allele-integrated deep learning framework for improving Class I &amp; Class II HLA-binding predictions [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/318881</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318881v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Motivation: The immune system has potential to present a wide variety of peptides to itself as a means of surveillance for pathogenic invaders.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Antenatal care (ANC) is a major public health intervention aimed at ensuring safe pregnancy outcomes. In Nigeria, the recommended minimum of four times ANC attendance is underutilized. This study investigates the prevalence and factors associated with underutilization of ANC services with a focus on the differences between rural and urban residences in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey dataset with adjustment for the sampling weight and the cluster design of the survey. The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was assessed using frequency tabulation while associated factors were examined using Chi-Square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was 46.5% in Nigeria, 61.1% in rural residence and 22.4% in urban residence. The North-West region had the highest prevalence of ANC underuse in Nigeria at 69.3%, 76.6% and 44.8% for the overall, rural and urban residences respectively. Factors associated with greater odds of ANC underuse in rural residence were maternal non-working status, birth interval &amp;lt; 24 months, single birth type, not listening to radio at all, lack of companionship to health facility and not getting money for health services. In urban residence, mothers professing Islam, those who did not read newspaper at all, and those who lacked health insurance, had greater odds of ANC underuse. In both rural and urban residence, maternal and husband’s education level, region of residence, wealth index, maternal age, frequency of watching television, distance to- and permission to visit health facility were significantly associated with ANC underuse.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural-urban differences exist in the use of ANC services, and to varying degrees, factors associated with underuse of ANC in Nigeria. Interventions aimed at addressing factors identified in this study may help to improve the utilization of ANC services both in rural and urban Nigeria. Such interventions need to focus more on reducing socioeconomic, geographic and regional disparities in access to ANC in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>bf46c585</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197324</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761224:93d646dc</id><author><name>Emmanuel Olorunleke Adewuyi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emmanuel Olorunleke Adewuyi, Asa Auta, Vishnu Khanal, Olasunkanmi David Bamidele, Cynthia Pomaa Akuoko, Kazeem Adefemi, Samson Joseph Tapshak, Yun Zhao&lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Antenatal care (ANC) is a major public health intervention aimed at ensuring safe pregnancy outcomes. In Nigeria, the recommended minimum of four times ANC attendance is underutilized. This study investigates the prevalence and factors associated with underutilization of ANC services with a focus on the differences between rural and urban residences in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey dataset with adjustment for the sampling weight and the cluster design of the survey. The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was assessed using frequency tabulation while associated factors were examined using Chi-Square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was 46.5% in Nigeria, 61.1% in rural residence and 22.4% in urban residence. The North-West region had the highest prevalence of ANC underuse in Nigeria at 69.3%, 76.6% and 44.8% for the overall, rural and urban residences respectively. Factors associated with greater odds of ANC underuse in rural residence were maternal non-working status, birth interval &amp;lt; 24 months, single birth type, not listening to radio at all, lack of companionship to health facility and not getting money for health services.

Interventions aimed at addressing factors identified in this study may help to improve the utilization of ANC services both in rural and urban Nigeria. Such interventions need to focus more on reducing socioeconomic, geographic and regional disparities in access to ANC in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337675v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>ARGs-OSP: online searching platform for antibiotic resistance genes distribution in metagenomic database and bacterial whole genome database [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/04/337675</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/337675v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Background The antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) have been emerging as one of the top global issue s in both medical and environmental fields.

The transcriptional network and protein regulators that govern T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation have been studied extensively using advanced genomic approaches. For a better understanding of these biological processes, we have moved a step forward, from gene- to protein-level characterization of Th17 cells. Mass spectrometry–based label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics analysis were made of in vitro differentiated murine Th17 and induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells. More than 4,000 proteins, covering almost all subcellular compartments, were detected. Quantitative comparison of the protein expression profiles resulted in the identification of proteins specifically expressed in the Th17 and iTreg cells. Importantly, our combined analysis of proteome and gene expression data revealed protein expression changes that were not associated with changes at the transcriptional level. Our dataset provides a valuable resource, with new insights into the proteomic characteristics of Th17 and iTreg cells, which may prove useful in developing treatment of autoimmune diseases and developing tumor immunotherapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3TAHD3yxTS4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>2</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>e52d0514</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004194</link><crawled>1527789422282</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163b75886ca:c89e3:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Imran Mohammad</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Imran Mohammad, Kari Nousiainen, Santosh D.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Social inequalities are widely accepted to have a deleterious effect on children’s mental health, and those with lower socioeconomic status generally experience more mental health issues. In this study, we examine the impact of socioeconomic situations of children’s families during their early childhood on the children’s social adaptation in Japanese elementary school.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The current investigation consisted of two sets of data relating to two separate years (with a one-year interval). The participants included preschoolers aged five years at Time 1 (the first year) and first graders aged six years at Time 2 (the second year); 1,712 met the inclusion criteria for both years. Parents of the participants completed a self-reported questionnaire regarding their SES (i.e., family economy and mother’s education) and their children’s mental health. Mental health was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist/4–18, Parent Report.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For each SES indicator, we found an inverse relationship across all the symptom dimensions. Specifically, bivariate analyses revealed that lower family income, maternal education level, and paternal education level predict all three domains of behavioral problems (i.e., internalized problems, externalized problems, and total behavioral problems). Further, multivariate analyses revealed that lower family income consistently predicts all domains of behavioral problems, lower maternal education level predicted externalized problems and total behavioral problems, and paternal education level did not predict any clinically significant behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In this sample, we found that, for children, family income and parental education when entering preschool were significant predictors of mental health problems after elementary school enrollment; in particular, low income and low maternal educational achievement predicted a high probability of the development of a psychiatric disorder. A greater understanding of the mechanisms of these associations could contribute to improvements in interventions aimed at preventing child maladjustment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>c1d96eb2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197961</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2d:2835af05</id><author><name>Rikuya Hosokawa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rikuya Hosokawa, Toshiki Katsura&lt;/p&gt;

A greater understanding of the mechanisms of these associations could contribute to improvements in interventions aimed at preventing child maladjustment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/E5317.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Arginine methylation is required for canonical Wnt signaling and endolysosomal trafficking [Cell Biology]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/E5317</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/23/E5317/F3.medium.gif</url><height>395</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/E5317.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Arginine methylation has emerged as a widespread and reversible protein modification with the potential to regulate a multitude of cellular processes, but its function is poorly understood.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>118</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>3e9b2388</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</link><crawled>1525801275042</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16340d7cea2:14b5655:abeb7260</id><author><name>Matthew E.

This retrospective study describes the biological and epidemiological aspects, gross and microscopical findings, and most likely causes of death (CD) in two species of Neotropical deer in Brazil. The animals were collected between 1995 and 2015 and represented 75 marsh deer (MD) and 136 brown brocket deer (BBD). Summarized, pneumonia was diagnosed microscopically in 48 MD and 52 BBD; 76 deer suffered trauma, involving dog attack (14 BBD) and vehicle-collision (14 BBD). Pulmonary edema (50 MD; 55 BBD) and congestion (57 MD; 78 BBD) were the most common findings for both species. Additionally, we diagnosed ruminal and myocardial mycosis in MD and BBD, respectively; ovarian dysgerminoma and pancreatic trematodiasis in BBD; and lesions suggestive of malignant catarrhal fever and orbiviral hemorrhagic disease in both species. The main CD in MD was: respiratory (41/75), alimentary, nutritional, trauma and euthanasia (3/75 each). Correspondingly, in BBD were: trauma (34/131), respiratory (30/131) and euthanasia (9/131). Respiratory disease was often defined by pulmonary edema and pneumonia. We provide evidence that respiratory disease, mainly pneumonia, is a critical pathological process in these Neotropical deer species. Although no etiological agents were identified, there is evidence of bacterial and viral involvement. Our results show trauma, mainly anthropogenic, as a common ailment in BBD. We propose to prioritize respiratory disease in future research focused on South American deer health aspects. We believe anthropogenic trauma may be a primary threat for populations of BBD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>b9928193</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198670</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:6683355:3dd877af</id><author><name>Pedro Enrique Navas-Suárez</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pedro Enrique Navas-Suárez, Josué Díaz-Delgado, Eliana Reiko Matushima, Cintia Maria Fávero, Angélica Maria Sánchez Sarmiento, Carlos Sacristán, Ana Carolina Ewbank, Adriana Marques Joppert, Jose Mauricio Barbanti Duarte, Cinthya dos Santos-Cirqueira, Bruno Cogliati, Leonardo Mesquita, Paulo César Maiorka, José Luiz Catão-Dias&lt;/p&gt;

T cell recognition of peptides presented within self-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules is essential for long-lived protective immunity. As mice age the number of naïve CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells declines. However, unlike for CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, there are more naïve and memory phenotype CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells that bind foreign pMHCII in old mice (18–22 months) than adults (12–15 weeks), suggesting increased promiscuity of pMHCII recognition with aging. Here we asked if CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses to immunization or infection increase with aging since the magnitude of a CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell response to a foreign pMHCII is proportional to the size of the precursor population in adult mice. We observed no difference in the number of pMHCII-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in adult versus old mice for pooled secondary lymphoid organs after immunization, bacterial infection, or viral infection, but we did observe diminished numbers of pMHCII-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in both the draining lymph node and brain of old mice after West Nile virus infection.

Background &lt;p&gt;Aspiration of gastric acid is an important cause of acute lung injury. The time course of the pulmonary response to such an insult beyond the initial 48 hours is incompletely characterized. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively describe the pulmonary effects of focal lung acid injury over a seven day period in both directly injured and not directly injured lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Wistar rats underwent left-endobronchial instillation with hydrochloric acid and were sacrificed at 4, 24, 48, 96 or 168 h after the insult. Healthy non-injured animals served as controls. We assessed inflammatory cell counts and cytokine levels in right and left lung lavage fluid and blood, arterial oxygen tension, alterations in lung histology, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio and differential lung perfusion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Lung acid instillation induced an early strong inflammatory response in the directly affected lung, peaking at 4–24 hours, with only partial resolution after 7 days. A less severe response with complete resolution after 4 days was seen in the opposite lung. Alveolar cytokine levels, with exception of IL-6, only partially reflected the localization of lung injury and the time course of the functional and histologic alterations. Alveolar leucocyte subpopulations exhibited different time courses in the acid injured lung with persistent elevation of alveolar lymphocytes and macrophages. After acid instillation there was an early transient decrease in arterial oxygen tension and lung perfusion was preferentially distributed to the non-injured lung.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings provide a basis for further research in the field of lung acid injury and for studies exploring effects of mechanical ventilation on injured lungs. Incomplete recovery in the directly injured lung 7 days after acid instillation suggests that increased vulnerability and susceptibility to further noxious stimuli are still present at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>fa7f5e14</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198440</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b78c:3dd877af</id><author><name>Florian Setzer</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Setzer, Barbara Schmidt, Lars Hueter, Konrad Schwarzkopf, Jörg Sänger, Torsten Schreiber&lt;/p&gt;

Incomplete recovery in the directly injured lung 7 days after acid instillation suggests that increased vulnerability and susceptibility to further noxious stimuli are still present at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/3Qhmiam1PwQ/s41598-018-25732-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Author Correction: Structure and Distribution of an Unrecognized Interstitium in Human Tissues</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25732-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25732_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>538</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25732-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25732-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Structure and Distribution of an Unrecognized Interstitium in Human Tissues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Structure and Distribution of an Unrecognized Interstitium in Human Tissues, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25732-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25732-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Structure and Distribution of an Unrecognized Interstitium in Human Tissues&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/3Qhmiam1PwQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525935600000</published><fingerprint>ca16762a</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25732-x</link><crawled>1525904431869</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16346fddafd:eb5c64:93d646dc</id><author><name>Petros C.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The first aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between liver stiffness measurement, hepatic venous pressure and liver fibrosis. The second aim was to demonstrate the utility of real-time shear wave elastography for evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients before and after balloon hepatic venous angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 32 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome slated for successful balloon angioplasty met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Shear wave elastography was used to generate dynamic liver stiffness measurement 2 days before angioplasty and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty. Hepatic venous pressures were measured during balloon angioplasty. Correlations among liver stiffness, hepatic venous pressure, and fibrosis were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Mean liver stiffness was 35.17 ± 10.60 kPa, 20.15 ± 5.47 kPa, 15.36 ± 4.34 kPa and 15.68 ± 5.58 kPa at baseline and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty, respectively. Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001); liver stiffness measured at 6 months after angioplasty was not significantly different from that measured at 3 months after angioplasty (P = 0.636). Analysis of liver stiffness measurement and hepatic venous pressure before balloon angioplasty yielded a coefficient of correlation r = 0.701 (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Before and 2d after angioplasty, liver stiffness measurement did not correlated with fibrosis (r = − 0.170, P = 0.22), (r = 0.223, P = 0.220), respectively, while the LSM difference before and 2 days after angioplasty negatively correlated with stiffness severity (r = − 0.502, P = 0.003). Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001), remaining stable at 3 months, though still in the cirrhotic range.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The liver stiffness of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients, measured by shear wave elastography, decreased considerably after hepatic venous recanalization, and significantly correlated with hepatic venous pressure though not with degree of fibrosis.

The data about the clinical impact and bacterial characteristics of hospital-onset (HO)- and community-onset (CO)-MRSA in HD patients are scarce. The current study analyzed the difference in the clinical and molecular characteristics of HO-MRSA and CO-MRSA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a retrospective review and molecular analysis of clinical isolates from 106 HD patients with MRSA bacteremia from 2009 to 2014.

There was no significant difference in the treatment failure rates between patients with CO-MRSA infections and those with HO-MRSA infections. CA genotypes were associated with less treatment failure (odds ratio [OR]: 0.18; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.07–0.49; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001).

The link between athlete physique and performance in sports is well established. However, a direct link between somatotype three-numeral rating and anaerobic performance has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the relations between somatotype and anaerobic performance using both singular and multivariate analyses. Thirty-six physically active males (mean ± standard deviation age 26.0 ± 9.8 years; body mass 79.5 ± 12.9 kg; height 1.82 ± 0.07 m) were somatotype-rated using the Heath-Carter method. Subjects were assessed for 3 repetition maximum (3 RM) bench press and back squat, and completed a 30-second maximal sprint cycle test. Positive correlations were observed between mesomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = 0.560, p &amp;lt; 0.001), mesomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = 0.550, p = 0.001) and between mesomorphy and minimum power output (r = 0.357, p = 0.033). Negative correlations were observed between ectomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = -0.381, p = 0.022), and ectomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = -0.336, p = 0.045). Individual regression analysis indicated that mesomorphy was the best predictor of 3 RM bench press performance, with 31.4% of variance in 3 RM bench press performance accounted for by the mesomorphy rating (p &amp;lt; 0.001). A combination of mesomorphy and ectomorphy best predicted 3 RM back squat performance (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.388, p &amp;lt; 0.04). Around one third of strength performance is predicted by somatotype-assessed physique in physically active males. This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>cd6e61a3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197761</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094068:2835af05</id><author><name>Helen Ryan-Stewart</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Helen Ryan-Stewart, James Faulkner, Simon Jobson&lt;/p&gt;

Due to the claimed C-C bond breaking ability, Rh-containing systems are intensively investigated and widely recognized as the most promising candidates as anode materials for ethanol-feed low temperature fuel cells. This study aims at verifying the claim of beneficial role of Rh towards C-C bond scission during low temperature ethanol electrooxidation on Pt-Rh nanoparticles. We determined that the surface-normalized amounts of CO2 produced during ethanol oxidation are comparable on Pt, Rh and Pt-Rh nanoalloys, and smaller than CO2 amounts obtained on exactly the same electrode from oxidation of monolayer of adsorbed CO. The whole amount of CO2 detected during ethanol oxidation, regardless of Rh presence, or lack of thereof, seems to come exclusively from oxidation of submonolayer of COads produced during dissociative adsorption of ethanol at low electrode potential, and its subsequent oxidation at sufficiently high electrode potential. Our work suggest that Rh-containing alloys are not more active towards C-C bond scission than pure Pt, and on both metals the mechanism of oxidation of ethanol to CO2 proceeds via the submonolayer of COads, which limits the quantity of CO2 produced from ethanol at room temperature to negligible amount. The higher activity of Rh-containing materials towards C-C bond scission claimed in literature was determined to be due to overinterpretation of selectivity data.To characterized the samples we used techniques like XPS, TEM, and cyclic voltammetry. For drove a conclusions we compere amount of CO2 detected in DEMS during ethanol oxidation reaction and so called CO stripping experiment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526601600000</published><fingerprint>8f102b2d</fingerprint><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/On_the_Lack_of_Beneficial_Role_of_Rh_Towards_C-C_Bond_Cleavage_During_Low_Temperature_Ethanol_Electrooxidation_on_Pt-Rh_Nanoalloys/6281264</link><crawled>1526643756671</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163730f0e7f:51904b8:93d646dc</id><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Numerous reports in scientific literature claim the increased activity of Rh-containing systems towards C-C bond scission in electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol at ambient temperatures.

We determined that the surface-normalized amounts of CO2 produced during ethanol oxidation are comparable on Pt, Rh and Pt-Rh nanoalloys, and smaller than CO2 amounts obtained on exactly the same electrode from oxidation of monolayer of adsorbed CO. The whole amount of CO2 detected during ethanol oxidation, regardless of Rh presence, or lack of thereof, seems to come exclusively from oxidation of submonolayer of COads produced during dissociative adsorption of ethanol at low electrode potential, and its subsequent oxidation at sufficiently high electrode potential. Our work suggest that Rh-containing alloys are not more active towards C-C bond scission than pure Pt, and on both metals the mechanism of oxidation of ethanol to CO2 proceeds via the submonolayer of COads, which limits the quantity of CO2 produced from ethanol at room temperature to negligible amount. The higher activity of Rh-containing materials towards C-C bond scission claimed in literature was determined to be due to overinterpretation of selectivity data.To characterized the samples we used techniques like XPS, TEM, and cyclic voltammetry. For drove a conclusions we compere amount of CO2 detected in DEMS during ethanol oxidation reaction and so called CO stripping experiment.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331942v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>MD-AD: Multi-task deep learning for Alzheimer&apos;s disease neuropathology [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/27/331942</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331942v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Systematic modeling of Alzheimer&apos;s Disease(AD) neuropathology based on brain gene expression would provide valuable insights into the disease.

With high efficiency and low sensitivity to high temperature and illumination conditions, it could, if developed towards a mature technology, present a viable approach to fill the gap in the negative emissions budget.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><title>H-bond to deliver fluoride</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.9.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-i?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525974002000</published><fingerprint>f2e24ce4</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-i?rss=1</link><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7da:93d646dc</id><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-i?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25349?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Size‐guided multi‐seed heuristic method for geometry optimization of clusters: Application to benzene clusters</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>Since searching for the global minimum on the potential energy surface of a cluster is very difficult, many geometry optimization methods have been proposed, in which initial geometries are randomly generated and subsequently improved with different algorithms.

The purpose of this research is to explore the link between plasma amylase and insulin levels in growing pigs. Blood was obtained from piglets ranging in age from preterm (8 days to full gestation period), up to postnatal day 90 (2 months post-weaning) that underwent either duodenal-jejunal bariatric interposition surgery or a sham-operation. Plasma amylase activities in preterm and full-term neonates ranged between 500–600 U/L and were decreased by 50% two months post-weaning. Preprandial insulin and C-peptide levels in neonate piglets were not detectable, however they rose gradually after weaning. An increase in plasma amylase activity was observed in the young pigs that underwent duodenal-jejunum bypass (metabolic) surgery. The increase in blood pancreatic amylase activity after an intravenous amylase infusion lowered the subsequent glucose-stimulated insulin/C-peptide release. We suggest a role for blood amylase in the regulation of glucose homeostasis after observing high blood amylase levels in neonate pigs, in pigs that underwent metabolic surgery, and as a result of the reduced glucose-stimulated insulin response following intravenous amylase administration. Blood amylase level is a dynamic physiological parameter, which is not merely a consequence of exocrine pancreatic digestive enzyme production, but rather a regulated factor involved in glucose assimilation and prandial insulin regulation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>3ac09be4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198672</link><crawled>1528384685390</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163dad3854e:658f438:3dd877af</id><author><name>Kateryna Goncharova Pierzynowska</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kateryna Goncharova Pierzynowska, Liudmyla Lozinska, Jarosław Woliński, Stefan Pierzynowski&lt;/p&gt;

While the impacts of extreme and rising mean temperatures are well documented, increased thermal variability associated with climate change may also threaten ectotherm fitness and survival, but remains poorly explored. Using three wild collected coprophagic species &lt;i&gt;Copris elphenor&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Metacatharsius opacus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scarabaeus zambezianus&lt;/i&gt;, we explored the effects of thermal amplitude around the mean on thermal tolerance. Using standardized protocols, we measured traits of high- (critical thermal maxima [CT&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;] and heat knockdown time [HKDT]) and -low temperature tolerance (critical thermal minima [CT&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;], chill coma recovery time [CCRT] and supercooling points [SCPs]) following variable temperature pulses (δ0, δ3, δ6 and δ9°C) around the mean (27°C). Our results show that increased temperature variability may offset basal and plastic responses to temperature and differs across species and metrics tested. Furthermore, we also show differential effects of body mass, body water content (BWC) and body lipid content (BLC) on traits of thermal tolerance. For example, body mass significantly influenced &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elphenor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;zambezianus&lt;/i&gt; CT&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;zambezianus&lt;/i&gt; HKDT but not CT&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and CCRT.

Benthic algae fuel summer food webs in many sunlit rivers, and are hotspots for primary and secondary production and biogeochemical cycling. Concerningly, riverine benthic algal assemblages can become dominated by toxic cyanobacteria, threatening water quality and public health. In the Eel River in Northern California, over a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin poisonings since 2000. During the summers of 2013–2015, we documented spatial and temporal patterns of cyanotoxin concentrations in the watershed, showing widespread distribution of anatoxin-a in benthic cyanobacterial mats. Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed weekly to record dissolved microcystin and anatoxin-a levels at 10 sites throughout the watershed, and 187 &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt;-dominated or &lt;i&gt;Phormidium-&lt;/i&gt;dominated cyanobacterial mat samples were collected from 27 locations to measure intracellular anatoxin-a (ATX) and microcystins (MCY). Anatoxin-a levels were higher than microcystin for both SPATT (mean MCY = 0.8 and ATX = 4.8 ng g resin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and cyanobacterial mat samples (mean MCY = 0.074 and ATX = 1.89 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). Of the benthic mats sampled, 58.9% had detectable anatoxin-a (max = 70.93 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), while 37.6% had detectable microcystins (max = 2.29 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW).

Objective &lt;p&gt;Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5–60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)—Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-Lung&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)—as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT—because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer—are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift). Patients with a negative AABT, and those scheduled for CT surveillance alone, are assumed to have periodic CT screenings to detect rapid growth and thus to have their lung cancers diagnosed—on average—at more advanced stages.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 1,000 patients who have incidentally detected nodules 8–30 mm, have an intermediate-risk of lung cancer, and are evaluated by CT surveillance alone, 95 (9.5%) are assumed to have lung cancer (local, 73.6%; regional, 22.0%; distant, 4.4%). With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 41%/93% (stage shift = 10.8%), although expected costs would be higher by $949,442 ($949 per person), life years would be higher by 53 (0.05 per person), resulting in a cost per life-year gained of $18,029 and a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $24,330. With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 28%/98% (stage shift = 7.4%), corresponding cost-effectiveness ratios would be $18,454 and $24,833.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Under our base-case assumptions, and reasonable variations thereof, using AABT as an aid in the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules who are estimated to be at intermediate risk of lung cancer and are scheduled for CT surveillance alone is likely to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>f052dadb</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197826</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406f:2835af05</id><author><name>John Edelsberg</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by John Edelsberg, Derek Weycker, Mark Atwood, Geoffrey Hamilton-Fairley, James R.

Recent experiments showed that engineered &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; colonies grow and self-organize into periodic stripes with high and low cell densities in semi-solid agar. The stripes develop sequentially behind a radially propagating colony front, similar to the formation of many other periodic patterns in nature. These bacteria were created by genetically coupling the intracellular chemotaxis pathway of wild-type cells with a quorum sensing module through the protein CheZ. In this paper, we develop multiscale models to investigate how this intracellular pathway affects stripe formation. We first develop a detailed hybrid model that treats each cell as an individual particle and incorporates intracellular signaling via an internal ODE system. To overcome the computational cost of the hybrid model caused by the large number of cells involved, we next derive a mean-field PDE model from the hybrid model using asymptotic analysis. We show that this analysis is justified by the tight agreement between the PDE model and the hybrid model in 1D simulations. Numerical simulations of the PDE model in 2D with radial symmetry agree with experimental data semi-quantitatively. Finally, we use the PDE model to make a number of testable predictions on how the stripe patterns depend on cell-level parameters, including cell speed, cell doubling time and the turnover rate of intracellular CheZ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s7yiJrNeGjk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>cbe379cc</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006178</link><crawled>1528135388145</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163cbf78bf1:de5cd4:c2c34441</id><author><name>Xiaoru Xue</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoru Xue, Chuan Xue, Min Tang&lt;/p&gt;

Branched products are obtained when electron-rich arylcyclopropanes react with a broad scope of arene nucleophiles in accord with a simple SN1-type ring-opening mechanism. In constrast, linear products are obtained when cyclopropylketones react with electron-rich arene nucleophiles. In the latter case, mechanistic experiments and DFT-calculations support a homo-conjugate addition pathway.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05034-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Will ocean zones with low oxygen levels expand or shrink?</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>800</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05034-y/d41586-018-05034-y_15736240.jpg</url><height>450</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05034-y</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will ocean zones with low oxygen levels expand or shrink?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will ocean zones with low oxygen levels expand or shrink?, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05034-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05034-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Computer simulations show that areas of the ocean that have low levels of dissolved oxygen will expand, but then shrink, in response to global warming — adding to an emerging picture of the finely balanced processes involved.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>24</engagement><published>1525762800000</published><fingerprint>1ce07b65</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05034-y</link><crawled>1525771785629</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1633f15d59d:1397e0:3dd877af</id><author><name>Laure  Resplandy</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will ocean zones with low oxygen levels expand or shrink?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will ocean zones with low oxygen levels expand or shrink?, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05034-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05034-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Computer simulations show that areas of the ocean that have low levels of dissolved oxygen will expand, but then shrink, in response to global warming — adding to an emerging picture of the finely balanced processes involved.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/acbcct/~3/0UegGSeDs9g/acschembio.8b00313</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Antitumor Humoral and T Cell Responses by Mucin-1 Conjugates of Bacteriophage Qß in Wild-type Mice</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00313/20180530/images/medium/cb-2018-003137_0009.gif</url><height>154</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00313</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00313</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00313/20180530/images/medium/cb-2018-003137_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00313&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a key nuclear transcription factor, is associated with prognosis in a variety of human cancers. However, the clinical value of NF-κB in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still controversial. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to obtain an accurate evaluation of the relationship between NF-κB expression and survival prognosis of NSCLC patients based on published articles. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for potential articles. A total of 1159 patients from 7 eligible studies comparing prognostic significance of NF-κB expression levels in NSCLC were included in our meta-analysis. I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistic and P value were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. The results of analysis were presented as hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity of NSCLC patients and NF-kB cellular localization within cancer cells were conducted to illustrate the potential discrepancy. Significant heterogeneity was considered at I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;50% and P&amp;lt;0.05, and random-effects model was used. The combined results indicated that higher NF-κB expression was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients (HR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.51–5.12, P = 0.001). Moreover, NF-κB expression was closely associated with tumor stage (HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.18–0.57, P&amp;lt;0.0001), lymph node metastasis (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.38–0.83, P = 0.004) and 5-year OS for NSCLC patients (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.02–3.31, P = 0.04). We conclude that NF-κB expression may be a potential unfavorable prognostic marker for NSCLC patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>5acba10d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198223</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c2d:3dd877af</id><author><name>Lijun Gu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lijun Gu, Zhiyan Wang, Jing Zuo, Hongmei Li, Lin Zha&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, we investigated the relationship between propofol and autophagy and examined whether this relationship depends on ER stress, production of ROS (reactive oxygen species), and disruption of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) homeostasis. To this end, we measured C2C12 cell apoptosis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, along with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels; ROS production; and expression of proteins and genes associated with autophagy, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, and ER stress, including LC3 (microtubule-associate protein 1 light chain 3), p62, AMPK (adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK, mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), phosphorylated mTOR, CHOP (C/BEP homologous protein), and Grp78/Bip (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein). We found that propofol treatment induced autophagy, ER stress, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release. The ratio of phosphorylated AMPK to AMPK increased, whereas the ratio of phosphorylated mTOR to mTOR decreased. Collectively, the data suggested that propofol induced autophagy &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; through ER stress, resulting in elevated ROS and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, co-administration of an ER stress inhibitor blunted the effect of propofol.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>e35dcf06</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197934</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e27:2835af05</id><author><name>Xi Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xi Chen, Long-Yun Li, Jin-Lan Jiang, Kai Li, Zhen-Bo Su, Fu-Qiang Zhang, Wen-Jing Zhang, Guo-Qing Zhao&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, co-administration of an ER stress inhibitor blunted the effect of propofol.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/vI9mqpPsjZg/s41598-018-27120-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Anomalous ellipticity dependence in nonsequential double ionization of ArXe</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-27120-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_27120_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>650</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27120-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27120-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anomalous ellipticity dependence in nonsequential double ionization of ArXe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anomalous ellipticity dependence in nonsequential double ionization of ArXe, Published online: 08 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27120-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-27120-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Anomalous ellipticity dependence in nonsequential double ionization of ArXe&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vI9mqpPsjZg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528441200000</published><fingerprint>8ffc4755</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27120-x</link><crawled>1528449386648</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163deaec898:6cde012:2835af05</id><author><name>Cheng Huang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anomalous ellipticity dependence in nonsequential double ionization of ArXe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anomalous ellipticity dependence in nonsequential double ionization of ArXe, Published online: 08 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27120-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-27120-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Anomalous ellipticity dependence in nonsequential double ionization of ArXe&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vI9mqpPsjZg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><title>Novel transgenic pigs with enhanced growth and reduced environmental impact</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34286</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34286</originId><summary><content>In pig production, inefficient feed digestion causes excessive nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen to be released to the environment.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke unless treated with an anticoagulant. Detecting AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aims of this study were to develop a screening model to detect AF in a primary healthcare setting and to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study. All 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary healthcare center in Stockholm were invited to participate in AF screening upon visiting the center during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the center during this period were invited to participate by letter. Thirty-second intermittent ECG recordings were made twice a day using a handheld Zenicor device over a 2-week period in participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of the 415 eligible individuals, a total of 324 (78.1%) patients participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score of the participants was 3. In the target population, 34 (8.2%) individuals had previously diagnosed AF. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Oral anticoagulant therapy was successfully initiated in 88% of these patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The AF screening project exhibited a high participation rate and resulted in a high rate of newly discovered AF; of these newly diagnosed patients, 88% could be treated with an oral anticoagulant.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>83e1e24a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198069</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e39:2835af05</id><author><name>Faris Ghazal</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Faris Ghazal, Holger Theobald, Mårten Rosenqvist, Faris Al-Khalili&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Maternal nutrition during pregnancy has been related to intrauterine brain development and neurodevelopmental disabilities in adult life. We aim to investigate associations between periconceptional maternal dietary patterns and prenatal cerebellar growth from the first trimester onwards.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;126 women with singleton non-malformed pregnancies were enrolled before 8 weeks of gestation in the Rotterdam periconceptional cohort between 2013 and 2015. Periconceptional maternal dietary patterns were extracted from food frequency questionnaires and associated with blood biomarkers and micronutrient intakes. Serial two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasound scans were performed at 9, 11, 22, 26 and 32 weeks of gestation for transcerebellar diameter (TCD) measurement. Linear mixed models were estimated to investigate associations between periconceptional maternal dietary patterns and longitudinal TCD measurements as a function of gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We performed a median of 4 scans per pregnancy, resulting in 570 total datasets. The success rate of TCD measurements was 87% (range 65–100%), depending on gestational age. The Mediterranean, Western, egg-rich and dairy-rich dietary patterns were extracted, explaining 37.2% of the overall variance of food intake in this population. The dairy-rich dietary pattern was positively associated with cerebellar growth trajectories (β = 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01; 0.03) √mm, p = 0.01). Maternal strong adherence to this dietary pattern increased TCD measurements by 0.8 standard deviation scores (SDs) compared to weak adherence, reflected in increased TCD estimates of 0.44 mm at 9 weeks (+6.8%), 0.88 mm at 22 weeks (+3.6%), and 1.17 mm at 32 weeks (+2.8%). No significant associations were detected for the Mediterranean, Western and egg-rich dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study shows a positive association between periconceptional maternal adherence to a dairy-rich dietary pattern and human prenatal TCD measurements as a proxy of cerebellar growth. Next step is the investigation of the impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>365c3719</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197901</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f233f:2835af05</id><author><name>Francesca Parisi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francesca Parisi, Melek Rousian, Irene V.

The aim of this study was to present a novel analytical quality by design (AQbD) approach for developing an HPLC method to analyze herbal extracts. In this approach, critical method attributes (CMAs) and critical method parameters (CMPs) of the analytical method were determined using the same data collected from screening experiments. The HPLC-ELSD method for separation and quantification of sugars in &lt;i&gt;Codonopsis Radix&lt;/i&gt; extract (CRE) samples and &lt;i&gt;Astragali Radix&lt;/i&gt; extract (ARE) samples was developed as an example method with a novel AQbD approach. Potential CMAs and potential CMPs were found with Analytical Target Profile. After the screening experiments, the retention time of the D-glucose peak of CRE samples, the signal-to-noise ratio of the D-glucose peak of CRE samples, and retention time of the sucrose peak in ARE samples were considered CMAs. The initial and final composition of the mobile phase, flow rate, and column temperature were found to be CMPs using a standard partial regression coefficient method. The probability-based design space was calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation method and verified by experiments. The optimized method was validated to be accurate and precise, and then it was applied in the analysis of CRE and ARE samples. The present AQbD approach is efficient and suitable for analysis objects with complex compositions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>b2a41abb</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198515</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0ae:2835af05</id><author><name>Jingyuan Shao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jingyuan Shao, Wen Cao, Haibin Qu, Jianyang Pan, Xingchu Gong&lt;/p&gt;

The protein kinase (PK, kinome) family is one of the largest families in plants and regulates almost all aspects of plant processes, including plant development and stress responses. Despite their important functions, comprehensive functional classification, evolutionary analysis and expression patterns of the cotton PK gene family has yet to be performed on PK genes. In this study, we identified the cotton kinomes in the &lt;i&gt;Gossypium raimondii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium arboretum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gossypium barbadense&lt;/i&gt; genomes and classified them into 7 groups and 122–24 subfamilies using software HMMER v3.0 scanning and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. Some conserved exon-intron structures were identified not only in cotton species but also in primitive plants, ferns and moss, suggesting the significant function and ancient origination of these PK genes. Collinearity analysis revealed that 16.6 million years ago (Mya) cotton-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) events may have played a partial role in the expansion of the cotton kinomes, whereas tandem duplication (TD) events mainly contributed to the expansion of the cotton RLK group. Synteny analysis revealed that tetraploidization of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; contributed to the expansion of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; PKs. Global expression analysis of cotton PKs revealed stress-specific and fiber development-related expression patterns, suggesting that many cotton PKs might be involved in the regulation of the stress response and fiber development processes. This study provides foundational information for further studies on the evolution and molecular function of cotton PKs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>3c6cb368</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197392</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b5:2835af05</id><author><name>Jun Yan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jun Yan, Guilin Li, Xingqi Guo, Yang Li, Xuecheng Cao&lt;/p&gt;

Biodiversity loss in riparian forests has the potential to alter rates of leaf litter decomposition in stream ecosystems. However, studies have reported the full range of positive, negative and no effects of plant diversity loss on decomposition, and there is currently no explanation for such inconsistent results. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether plant diversity loss affects other ecological processes related to decomposition, such as fine particulate organic matter production or detritivore growth, which precludes a thorough understanding of how detrital stream food webs are impacted by plant diversity loss. We used a microcosm experiment to examine the effects of plant diversity loss on litter decomposition, fine particulate organic matter production, and growth of a dominant leaf-shredding detritivore, using litter mixtures varying in species composition. We hypothesized that plant diversity loss would decrease the rates of all studied processes, but such effects would depend on the leaf traits present in litter mixtures (both their average values and their variability). Our findings partly supported our hypotheses, showing that plant diversity loss had a consistently negative effect on litter decomposition and fine particulate organic matter production (but not on detritivore growth) across litter mixtures, which was mediated by detritivores. Importantly, the magnitude of the diversity effect and the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying this effect (i.e., complementarity vs. selection) varied depending on the species composition of litter mixtures, mainly because of differences in litter nutritional quality and trait variability. Complementarity was prevalent but varied in size, with positive selection effects also occurring in some mixtures. Our results support the notion that loss of riparian plant species is detrimental to key stream ecosystem processes that drive detrital food webs, but that the magnitude of such effects largely depends on the the order of species loss.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>1017e64</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198243</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c2e:3dd877af</id><author><name>Naiara López-Rojo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naiara López-Rojo, Aingeru Martínez, Javier Pérez, Ana Basaguren, Jesús Pozo, Luz Boyero&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of active weight loss attempts in Sweden, and to study the extent to which overweight individuals may or may not correctly identify themselves as overweight. Additional aims were to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with following a specific dietary regimen and with attempts at losing weight. A postal questionnaire was sent to 2000 randomly selected men and women living in Sweden. The inclusion criteria was an age of 20–65 years. In total, the response rate was 28% and the completed questionnaires from 555 participants were analyzed in this study. In total, 46% of participants were overweight or obese by self-reported height and weight. Additionally, 42% of overweight and 90% of obese individuals correctly identified themselves as being overweight. Weight loss was pursued by 41% and was more common among women, those with higher physical activity, higher BMI and higher socioeconomic position. Overall, 22% followed a specific diet, and following a dietary regimen was associated with female gender, higher education level and overweight. In conclusion, almost half of the participants were either overweight or trying to lose weight. Trying to lose weight and following a specific dietary regimen were related to female gender, high BMI and higher socioeconomic position. This could indicate that the socioeconomic disparities in health are further exacerbated, as overweight individuals with poor socioeconomic position might be more likely to remain overweight.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>e982054f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197099</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914e:93d646dc</id><author><name>Linnea Bärebring</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linnea Bärebring, Anna Winkvist, Hanna Augustin&lt;/p&gt;

It has become apparent that traditional sequence alignment algorithms, used for the curation of genomes, are not able to map the full complexity of the genomic landscape. We present DeepRibo, a novel neural network applying ribosome profiling data that shows to be a precise tool for the delineation and annotation of expressed genes in prokaryotes.

It has become apparent that traditional sequence alignment algorithms, used for the curation of genomes, are not able to map the full complexity of the genomic landscape. We present DeepRibo, a novel neural network applying ribosome profiling data that shows to be a precise tool for the delineation and annotation of expressed genes in prokaryotes. The neural network combines recurrent memory cells and convolutional layers, adapting the information gained from both the high-throughput ribosome profiling data and Shine-Dalgarno region into one model. DeepRibo is designed as a single model trained on a variety of ribosome profiling experiments, and is therefore evaluated on independent datasets.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by loss of cone photoreceptors. Previously, when tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a key extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator that binds to and inhibits activation of Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was intravitreal injected into eyes of a transgenic rhodopsin rat model of RP, S334ter-line3, we discovered cone outer segments are partially protected. In parallel, we reported that a specific MMP9 and MMP2 inhibitor, SB-3CT, interferes with mechanisms leading to rod photoreceptor cell death in an MMP9 dependent manner. Here, we extend our initial rat studies to examine the potential of TIMP1 as a treatment in retinal degeneration by investigating neuroprotective effects in a classic mouse retinal degeneration model, &lt;i&gt;rd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Pde6b-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt;). The results clearly demonstrate that intravitreal injections of TIMP1 produce extended protection to delay rod photoreceptor cell death. The mean total number of rods in whole-mount retinas was significantly greater in TIMP-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P35 (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and P45 (P&amp;lt;0.05) than in saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas. In contrast, SB-3CT did not delay rod cell death, leading us to further investigate alternative pathways that do not involve MMPs. In addition to inducing phosphorylated ERK1/2, TIMP1 significantly reduces BAX activity and delays attenuation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Physiological responses using scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) reveal b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated retinas are significantly greater than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). In later degenerative stages of &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas, photopic b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas are significantly larger than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05).

Lysosomal dysfunction is associated with a number of age-related pathologies that affect all organ systems. While much research has focused on neurodegenerative diseases and aging-induced changes in neurons, much less is known about the impact that aging has on lower urinary tract function. Our studies explored age-dependent changes in the content of endo-lysosomal organelles (i.e., multivesicular bodies, lysosomes, and the product of their fusion, endolysosomes) and age-induced effects on lysosomal degradation in the urothelium, the epithelial tissue that lines the inner surface of the bladder, ureters, and renal pelvis. When examined by transmission electron microscopy, the urothelium from young adult rats (~3 months), mature adult rats (~12 months), and aged rats (~26 months old) demonstrated a progressive age-related accumulation of aberrantly large endolysosomes (up to 7μm in diameter) that contained undigested content, likely indicating impaired degradation. Stereological analysis confirmed that aged endolysosomes occupied approximately 300% more volume than their younger counterparts while no age-related change was observed in multivesicular bodies or lysosomes. Consistent with diminished endolysosomal degradation, we observed that cathepsin B activity was significantly decreased in aged versus young urothelial cell lysates as well as in live cells. Further, the endolysosomal pH of aged urothelium was higher than that of young adult (pH 6.0 vs pH 4.6). Our results indicate that there is a progressive decline in urothelial endolysosomal function during aging. How this contributes to bladder dysfunction in the elderly is discussed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>61df112c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198817</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0bf:2835af05</id><author><name>Steven T.

Stereological analysis confirmed that aged endolysosomes occupied approximately 300% more volume than their younger counterparts while no age-related change was observed in multivesicular bodies or lysosomes. Consistent with diminished endolysosomal degradation, we observed that cathepsin B activity was significantly decreased in aged versus young urothelial cell lysates as well as in live cells. Further, the endolysosomal pH of aged urothelium was higher than that of young adult (pH 6.0 vs pH 4.6). Our results indicate that there is a progressive decline in urothelial endolysosomal function during aging. How this contributes to bladder dysfunction in the elderly is discussed.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Geochemistry, Geophysics</item></keywords><title>Triggering quakes in a geothermal space</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/976.4.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-d?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527788426000</published><fingerprint>5be5c636</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-d?rss=1</link><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d09b1:2835af05</id><author><name>Grocholski, B.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-d?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026120?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Diffusion quantum Monte Carlo and density functional calculations of the structural stability of bilayer arsenene</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 21, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026120?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/21&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 21&lt;/a&gt;, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528263797000</published><fingerprint>bc7f2254</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026120?af=R</link><crawled>1528356065737</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163d91ed1c9:63c5128:2835af05</id><author><name>Yelda Kadioglu</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 21, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/acbcct/~3/xgYtXhMs5yE/acschembio.8b00391</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Visualizing the Brain’s Astrocytes with Diverse Chemical Scaffolds</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00391/20180509/images/medium/cb-2018-00391b_0004.gif</url><height>247</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00391</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00391</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00391/20180509/images/medium/cb-2018-00391b_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00391&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The prevalence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly. Probiotics supplementation have been shown to improve metabolic health in humans. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health and pregnancy complications in pregnant women. The literature search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed, and data were synthesized in accordance with standardized guidelines. Ten randomized clinical trials with eligible data were included in our meta-analysis. For pregnant women with GDM, we found negative correlations between probiotics supplementation and fasting serum insulin (OR -2.94, 95%CI [-5.69, -0.20], p = 0.04) and homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (OR -0.65, 95%CI [-1.18, -0.11], p = 0.02). There were no significant correlations between probiotics supplementation and lipid levels in women with GDM, including total cholesterol (OR -2.72, 95%CI [-17.18, 11.74], P = 0.71), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (OR -0.29, 95%CI [-3.60, 3.03], P = 0.87), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (OR -0.38, 95%CI [-18.54, 17.79], P = 0.97), or triglycerides (OR -12.83, 95%CI [-36.63, 10.97], P = 0.29). For healthy pregnant women, probiotics supplementation were negatively associated with fasting serum insulin (OR -3.76, 95%CI [-4.29, -3.23], P &amp;lt; 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (OR -0.57, 95%CI [-1.08, -0.06], p = 0.03). However, no significant correlations were observed between probiotics supplementation and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (OR -2.02, 95%CI [-5.56, 1.52], p = 0.26). Thus, our study revealed that probiotics supplementation during pregnancy have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, rather than lipid metabolism among pregnant women.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>218d8e8d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197771</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676123b:93d646dc</id><author><name>Jia Zheng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jia Zheng, Qianyun Feng, Sheng Zheng, Xinhua Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Neonatal mortality is a significant problem in many low-resource countries, yet for every death there are many more newborns who suffer a life-threatening complication but survive. These “near-misses” are not well defined, nor are they well understood. This study sought to explore how health care providers at three tertiary care centers in Ghana (each with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)) understand the term “near-miss.” Eighteen providers from the NICUs at three teaching hospitals in Ghana (Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, and Cape Coast Teaching Hospital in Cape Coast) were interviewed in depth regarding their perceptions of neonatal morbidity, mortality, and survival. Near the end of the interview, they were specifically asked what they understood the term “near-miss” to mean. Participants included nurses and physicians at various levels and with varying years of practice (mean years of practice = 9.33, mean years in NICU = 3.66). Results indicate that the concept of “near-misses” is not universally understood, and providers differ on whether a baby is a near-miss or not. Providers disagreed on the utility of a near-miss classification for clinical practice, with some suggesting it would be helpful to draw their attention to those at highest risk of dying, with others suggesting that the acuity of illness in a NICU means any baby could become a ‘near-miss’ at any moment. Further efforts are needed to standardize the definitions of neonatal near-misses, including developing criteria that are able to be assessed in a low-resource setting. In addition, further research is warranted to determine the practical implications of using a near miss tool in the process of providing care in a resource-limited setting and whether it might be best reserved as a retrospective indicator of overall quality of care provided.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>4b81fe46</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198169</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb923:3dd877af</id><author><name>April J.

There are no defined correlates of protection for any intracellular pathogen, including the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, which causes tularemia. Evaluating vaccine efficacy against sporadic diseases like tularemia using field trials is problematic, and therefore alternative strategies to test vaccine candidates like the &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; Live Vaccine Strain (LVS), such as testing in animals and applying correlate measurements, are needed. Recently, we described a promising correlate strategy that predicted the degree of vaccine-induced protection in mice given parenteral challenges, primarily when using an attenuated &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; strain. Here, we demonstrate that using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in this approach predicts LVS-mediated protection against respiratory challenge of Fischer 344 rats with fully virulent &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, with exceptional sensitivity and specificity. Rats were vaccinated with a panel of LVS-derived vaccines and subsequently given lethal respiratory challenges with Type A &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;. In parallel, PBLs from vaccinated rats were evaluated for their functional ability to control intramacrophage &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; growth in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; co-culture assays. PBLs recovered from co-cultures were also evaluated for relative gene expression using a large panel of genes identified in murine studies. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; control of LVS intramacrophage replication reflected the hierarchy of protection. Further, despite variability between individuals, 22 genes were significantly more up-regulated in PBLs from rats vaccinated with LVS compared to those from rats vaccinated with the variant LVS-R or heat-killed LVS, which were poorly protective. These genes included IFN-γ, IL-21, NOS2, LTA, T-bet, IL-12rβ2, and CCL5. Most importantly, combining quantifications of intramacrophage growth control with 5–7 gene expression levels using multivariate analyses discriminated protected from non-protected individuals with greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity. The results therefore support translation of this approach to non-human primates and people to evaluate new vaccines against &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; and other intracellular pathogens.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>112a33f3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198140</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd86:3dd877af</id><author><name>Roberto De Pascalis</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roberto De Pascalis, Andrew Hahn, Helen M.

4′-cyano-2′-deoxyinosine (SK14-061a), a novel nucleoside analog based on inosine, has antiviral activity against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 that has the ability to acquire resistance against many types of reverse transcriptase inhibitors based on nucleosides. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics studies after its oral administration to rats. For this purpose, we first developed and validated an analytical method for quantitatively determining SK14-061a levels in biological samples by a UPLC system interfaced with a TOF-MS system. A rapid, simple and selective method for the quantification of SK14-061a in biological samples was established using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with solid phase extraction. The pharmacokinetic properties of SK14-061a in rats after oral administration were then evaluated using this LC-MS method. SK14-061a was found to be relatively highly bioavailable, is rapidly absorbed from the intestinal tract, and is then mainly distributed to the liver and then ultimately excreted via the urine in an unchanged form. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of SK14-061a with the nucleoside analog, entecavir, led to a significant alteration in the pharmacokinetics of SK14-061a. These results suggest that the SK14-061a has favorable pharmacokinetic properties with a high bioavailability with the potential for use in oral pharmaceutical formulations, but drug-drug interactions should also be considered.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>50058574</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198636</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f56:2835af05</id><author><name>Mai Hashimoto</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Hashimoto, Kazuaki Taguchi, Takako Ishiguro, Satoru Kohgo, Shuhei Imoto, Keishi Yamasaki, Hiroaki Mitsuya, Masaki Otagiri&lt;/p&gt;

Bacteria belonging to the genus &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; have been frequently found in association with a wide variety of marine eukaryotic invertebrate hosts, indicative of their versatile and symbiotic lifestyle. A recent comparison of the sponge-associated &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; genomes has shed light on the mechanisms influencing a successful symbiotic association with sponges. In contrast, the genomic architecture of &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; bacteria associated with other marine hosts has received less attention. Here, we performed genus-wide comparative analyses of 18 &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; isolated from sponges, coral, tunicates, flatworm, and seawater. The analyses revealed a certain degree of commonality among the majority of sponge- and coral-associated bacteria. Isolates from other marine invertebrate host, tunicates, exhibited a genetic repertoire for cold adaptation and specific metabolic abilities including mucin degradation in the Antarctic tunicate-associated bacterium &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; sp.

The highly similar prokaryotic DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (C5-MTases) M.MpeI and M.SssI share the specificity of eukaryotic C5-MTases (5’-CG), and can be useful research tools in the study of eukaryotic DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation. In an effort to improve the stability and solubility of complementing fragments of the two MTases, genes encoding circularly permuted (CP) variants of M.MpeI and M.SssI were created, and cloned in a plasmid vector downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter. MTase activity of the CP variants was tested by digestion of the plasmids with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Eleven of the fourteen M.MpeI permutants and six of the seven M.SssI permutants had detectable MTase activity as indicated by the full or partial protection of the plasmid carrying the cpMTase gene. Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>286dff4d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197232</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915b:93d646dc</id><author><name>Pál Albert</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pál Albert, Bence Varga, Nikolett Zsibrita, Antal Kiss&lt;/p&gt;

Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Anatomy, Morphology, Biomechanics, Ecology</item></keywords><title>Big mamas matter for fish</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.7.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-g?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525974002000</published><fingerprint>46d77a85</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-g?rss=1</link><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7dc:93d646dc</id><author><name>Vignieri, S.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-g?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Sociology</item></keywords><title>Experimental evidence for tipping points in social convention</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1116.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1116?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Theoretical models of critical mass have shown how minority groups can initiate social change dynamics in the emergence of new social conventions.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the association between preoperational factors and patients’ short-term outcome after proximal fibular osteotomy (PFO) and to provide a basis for detailed surgical indication and patient selection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing PFO between January 2015 and December 2015. Preoperational clinical data including gender, age, duration of disease, visual analogue score (VAS) and American Knee Society (KSS) score were collected. The radiological factors including hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA angle), condyle-plateau angle (CP angle), Kellgren and Lawrence grade (KL grade), joint space width of both compartments and settlement value were also considered. Patients were followed for at 12 months postoperatively. Both clinical and functional KSS scores were obtained. The outcome of interest was divided into clinical outcome and functional outcome. For each, two criteria were defined: satisfaction and significant improvement. Satisfaction is characterized by a KSS clinical or functional score over 70 points (excellent and good results); significant improvement refers to an increase in KSS scores of more than 15 points. Bivariate logistic regression for the association between preoperational factors and outcomes of interest was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to detect the independent factors affecting the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 84 patients and 111 knees were followed-up. Of these, 17 knees were from males and 94 were from females. The average age was 59.45±8.82 years. The average preoperational VAS score, KSS clinical and functional score were 7.08±1.41 points, 49.14±10.95 points and 44.97±17.71 points, respectively. According to KL grading, there were 17 knees of grade 2, 47 knees of grade 3, and 47 knees of grade 4. In clinical outcomes, there were 51 knees in the satisfaction group and 77 knees in the significant improvement group. In functional outcomes, 43 knees were in the satisfaction group and 76 knees in the significant improvement group. KSS clinical score (OR = 1.134, 95%CI = 1.067–1.205, P = 0.000) was the independent factor associated with clinical satisfaction.

KSS clinical (OR = 0.905, 95%CI = 0.850–0.963, P = 0.002) score, CP angle (OR = 0.760, 95%CI = 0.593–0.973, P = 0.030) and medial joint space width (OR = 0.001, 95%CI = 0.000–0.107, P = 0.003) were the independent factors associated with significant clinical improvement; VAS score (OR = 1.582, 95%CI = 1.042–2.402, P = 0.031), KSS functional (OR = 0.888, 95%CI = 0.838–0.942, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.292, 95%CI = 1.101–1.518, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 9.990, 95%CI = 1.485–67.197, P = 0.018) were the independent factors associated with significant functional improvement.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The independent factors affecting postoperative clinical outcome after PFO were KSS clinical score, CP angle and medial joint space width. In addition, the independent factors that influenced functional outcome included age, VAS score, KSS score, HKA angle and settlement value. As objective radiological evidence, HKA angle and settlement value could be used as an important basis for patient selection for PFO.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>95b1bb0a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197980</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2f:2835af05</id><author><name>Bo Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Liu, Wei Chen, Qi Zhang, Xiaoli Yan, Fei Zhang, Tianhua Dong, Guang Yang, Yingze Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>9a817a3c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002912</link><crawled>1526060694416</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f2:f3bf0074</id><author><name>Marie Ménard</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;

Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/ZYrb_nYVt2k/s41467-018-04306-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Polysulfurating reagent design for unsymmetrical polysulfide construction</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04306-5/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4306_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>427</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04306-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04306-5</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Polysulfurating reagent design for unsymmetrical polysulfide construction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polysulfurating reagent design for unsymmetrical polysulfide construction, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04306-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04306-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Synthetic methods to access unsymmetrical polysulfides are limited despite their high biological relevance.

Med. Chem. on “&lt;em&gt;What Makes a Great Medicinal Chemist&lt;/em&gt;“. As he makes clear from the beginning, if you’ve been doing this stuff for a while, you’ve likely heard many of these recommendations before. But it’s useful for people starting out, and it’s also useful for organization to think about what they’re encouraging (and what they’re not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several characteristics common to good scientists in general – paraphrasing, we have: (1) intellectual curiosity, (2) ability to focus on the problem at hand, (3) pragmatic approach to problem-solving, (4) respect for data, (5) attention to detail, (6) sense of urgency, (7) awareness of other work in the field, (8) openness to new technologies (once they’ve proved their utility!), (9) willingness to challenge assumptions and ditch old ones, (10) enjoyment of their work, (11) awareness of the limits of their knowledge, (12) resiliency, (13) effective at communication, (14) working well with team members (there are exceptions!), (15) not constantly seeking credit, and (16) looking for mentors early on, and serving as one later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past that, he has traits that are more specific to medicinal chemists: (17) never losing sight of the final drug profile, (18) the ability to come up with unusual structural ideas when needed, (19) attention to more than just potency, (20) three-dimensional thinking, (21) awareness of the need for different chemical series/scaffolds, (22) awareness of the competition, but not being scared of IP space, (23) never giving on validated targets, since they’re rare, (24) a deep understanding of biology, (25) decisiveness about what the next steps in a project should be, (26) being unafraid of tough chemistry (in a good cause), (27) a willingness to repurpose anything (in a good cause), and (28) awareness of the history of the field and its current state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s quite a list! And it should be clear at the outset that you’re not going to find people – or not too many – who have all those qualities turned up to 11. But they’re all useful and important, and it’s worth looking over them to see what your strengths are (and especially what you might need to shore up a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few comments on specific items: I think that (3), (9), and (27) are aspects of the same approach to applied research – that is, a willingness to go with what works, even if it isn’t your idea, even if it disproves your favorite assumptions, even if it seems weird or even if it seems obvious or old. Things that work, that really work, are the ace cards in the deck. Solid experimental evidence brushes aside feelings, theories, and assumptions (quality 4 above ), and you have to be ready to come to terms with it and figure out where it’s telling you to go next (quality 25). A corollary is that if you’re running experiments whose results are not going to be solid or important enough for you to base such decisions on, then why? We’ve all sat in meetings where someone outlines an experiment that (if it works) means the project goes on as planned. But if it doesn’t work? Then. . .the project goes on as planned anyway. It’s hard to see how that’s not, at some level, a waste of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has a connection with (11), knowing what you don’t know. There are mistakes at both ends of the scale (there always are), and in this case it’s being too tentative or being too confident. Chemists, in my experience, are more prone to the latter, the mistake the Greeks called &lt;em&gt;hubris&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone who’s honest with themselves about biomedical research has to admit that most of the time, about most things, we can only aspire to the level of actually knowing jack diddley. What really causes Alzheimer’s? What are the specific neuronal processes involved in consciousness? What’s the specific molecular process you’d need to hit to stop multiple sclerosis or lupus? On a more immediate level, why does Compound Series A get into cells while Compound Series B doesn’t? What do I need to do to the lead compound to make it about two times more potent at the target? Or about ten times less potent at that other target it’s hitting? What other targets is the thing hitting, anyway? And so on. Decision-making under these conditions is. . .nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why many of the desirable qualities above can in fact work against each other, if taken to extremes or misapplied. Attention to detail is important – but not to the point where you become unable to make a call because you can think of bad consequences every way you turn. Ability to focus is important, but not if it leads to glossing over key experimental data that are trying to tell you something. Mistakes at both ends of the scale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(24), understanding of biology, deserves some comment. My feeling is that not many people from other fields tend to know much about organic or medicinal chemistry, nor do they seem particularly eager to learn. So we chemists have a real advantage, knowing this stuff already, but you can’t rest on that advantage, either. The point is to start from there and &lt;em&gt;go learn about the other stuff&lt;/em&gt;. You can be useful as a chemist (at an entry-level position) without knowing much about the biology involved – just bang out compounds. But you cannot be really good at the job with that approach, nor (as time goes on) will you continue to be as valuable to your employer – or any other employer. The chemistry is just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quality worth noting is (12), resilience. A constant feature of drug research is that most things, most of the time, don’t work that well. Your ideas about improving the compounds? By golly, here come the assay data, and it’s back to the bench we go. You have to be ready for your best ideas, your biggest bolts of inspiration, to land in a tangled heap over and over. It takes getting used to, and some personality types are just not suited to it. Longterm med-chemists exhibit survivorship bias; they’re the ones who have been able to deal, but not everyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been focusing on individual behavior, but as mentioned above, there’s something to be said about organizations, too. Managers of all types should think about whether their labs, departments, or companies are providing a good home for these behaviors or not. Be honest. I’m not talking about wall posters, e-mail newsletters, or “State of the Company” speeches. Your mission statement might say that you’re committed to innovation or something, but talk is as cheap as it’s ever been. For employees looking at their own management, my advice is always this: don’t pay so much attention to what they say, but rather &lt;em&gt;watch what they do&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t read the slogans on the intranet pages – pay attention and &lt;em&gt;watch what behaviors your company actually rewards&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they’re valuing the sorts of things on Murcko’s list, that’s good news. But if they’re not, they may be rewarding some less worthwhile behaviors, like delivering on deadline even if it means delivering crap, whacking people on the head for coming up with inconvenient data or ideas, advancing projects based more on who proposed them than intrinsic merit, etc. There’s a whole Devil’s Dictionary/Screwtape Letters list of things that good medicinal chemists and scientists &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do, and you need to be alert to their presence, too. The devil finds work for idle hands, and for empty heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>21</engagement><published>1526995410000</published><fingerprint>ff452d4b</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13550</link><crawled>1526995922480</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_163880cae30:6b47063:3dd877af</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>Longtime medicinal chemist Mark Murcko has a Perspective article out in J.

Because such experiments are resource-intensive and frequently push the limits of sensitivity of the measurement techniques, optimization of experiment design can improve feasibility with respect to financial and labor costs, time to completion, and increase precision and accuracy of the results. Here we used a previously published set of data acquired in cultured insulinoma cells to evaluate contributions to the sensitivity and variability of the rate of citrate synthase (CS). Specifically, we calculated changes in uncertainty in CS if sample times were dropped or new ones were added, and we observed that some sampling times can be dropped with little effect, while improvements can be made with a strategic choice of when to add samples. We measured the contributions of data sampled at different times on the sensitivity of CS, finding that CS had greater sensitivity at early time points. We tested the concept that if two estimated parameters are correlated significantly, then refining one might constrain the other. In this case, the rate of Beta-ox was found to be correlated with CS, and narrower variability in Beta-ox did indeed improve the sensitivity of CS.

Because such experiments are resource-intensive and frequently push the limits of sensitivity of the measurement techniques, optimization of experiment design can improve feasibility with respect to financial and labor costs, time to completion, and increase precision and accuracy of the results. Here we used a previously published set of data acquired in cultured insulinoma cells to evaluate contributions to the sensitivity and variability of the rate of citrate synthase (CS). Specifically, we calculated changes in uncertainty in CS if sample times were dropped or new ones were added, and we observed that some sampling times can be dropped with little effect, while improvements can be made with a strategic choice of when to add samples. We measured the contributions of data sampled at different times on the sensitivity of CS, finding that CS had greater sensitivity at early time points. We tested the concept that if two estimated parameters are correlated significantly, then refining one might constrain the other. In this case, the rate of Beta-ox was found to be correlated with CS, and narrower variability in Beta-ox did indeed improve the sensitivity of CS. The tests described here might be applied at the initial design stage and then after a pilot phase to improve sensitivities of targeted fluxes and the reduction of materials, time, labor, and other experimental resources. The correlation analyses can be used to consider what orthogonal measurements might be beneficial for further improvement of measurements. While this study used a specific example of a set of time-dependent kinetic isotopic measurements, the results illustrate some generalizable behaviors that can be tested in other experimental systems.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022976?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Probing quantum coherence in ultrafast molecular processes: An ab initio approach to open quantum systems</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022976?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527647360000</published><fingerprint>a43d1ec4</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022976?af=R</link><crawled>1527751047075</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163b50ef7a3:2d10831:3dd877af</id><author><name>Emanuele Coccia</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/acbcct/~3/ljlfGkRZMTQ/acschembio.8b00262</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Spatially Restricting Bioorthogonal Nucleoside Biosynthesis Enables Selective Metabolic Labeling of the Mitochondrial Transcriptome</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00262/20180517/images/medium/cb-2018-00262w_0005.gif</url><height>144</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00262</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00262</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00262/20180517/images/medium/cb-2018-00262w_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00262&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common of the human porphyrias, arises from a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Studies have shown a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with PCT. While these observations implicate HCV infection as a risk factor for PCT pathogenesis, the mechanism of interaction between the virus and porphyrin metabolism is unknown. This study aimed to assess the effect of HCV core protein on intracellular porphyrin metabolism to elucidate the link between HCV infection and PCT. The accumulation and excretion of porphyrins after treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid, a porphyrin precursor, were compared between cells stably expressing HCV core protein and controls. Cells expressing HCV core protein had lower amounts of intracellular protoporphyrin IX and heme and had higher amounts of excreted coproporphyrin III, the oxidized form of coproporphyrinogen III, compared with controls. These observations suggest that HCV core protein affects porphyrin metabolism and facilitates the export of excess coproporphyrinogen III and/or coproporphyrin III, possibly via porphyrin transporters. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the presence of HCV core protein increased the mRNA expression of porphyrin exporters ABCG2 and FLVCR1. Western blot analysis showed a higher expression level of FLVCR1, but not ABCG2, as well as a higher expression level of mature ALAS1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway, in HCV core protein-expressing cells compared with controls. The data indicate that HCV core protein induced abnormal intracellular porphyrin metabolism, with an over-excretion of coproporphyrin III. These findings may partially account for the susceptibility of HCV-infected individuals to PCT development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>c113cddc</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198345</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84548:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Takafumi Nakano</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takafumi Nakano, Kyoji Moriya, Kazuhiko Koike, Toshiharu Horie&lt;/p&gt;

The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a complex, multifactorial disorder that develops slowly over time presenting itself with large differences among MetS patients. We applied a systems biology approach to describe and predict the onset and progressive development of MetS, in a study that combined &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; models. A new data-driven, physiological model (MINGLeD: Model INtegrating Glucose and Lipid Dynamics) was developed, describing glucose, lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Since classic kinetic models cannot describe slowly progressing disorders, a simulation method (ADAPT) was used to describe longitudinal dynamics and to predict metabolic concentrations and fluxes. This approach yielded a novel model that can describe long-term MetS development and progression. This model was integrated with longitudinal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data that was obtained from male APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for three months and that developed MetS as reflected by classical symptoms including obesity and glucose intolerance. Two distinct subgroups were identified: those who developed dyslipidemia, and those who did not. The combination of MINGLeD with ADAPT could correctly predict both phenotypes, without making any prior assumptions about changes in kinetic rates or metabolic regulation. Modeling and flux trajectory analysis revealed that differences in liver fluxes and dietary cholesterol absorption could explain this occurrence of the two different phenotypes. In individual mice with dyslipidemia dietary cholesterol absorption and hepatic turnover of metabolites, including lipid fluxes, were higher compared to those without dyslipidemia. Predicted differences were also observed in gene expression data, and consistent with the emergence of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, two well-known MetS co-morbidities. Whereas MINGLeD specifically models the metabolic derangements underlying MetS, the simulation method ADAPT is generic and can be applied to other diseases where dynamic modeling and longitudinal data are available.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MIj7qbH_8I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>4ce0ac36</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006145</link><crawled>1528393408162</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163db589ea2:44434b:c2c34441</id><author><name>Yvonne J.

Mast cells, in addition to endocrine cells and neurons, are typical secretory cells. Their function in allergic inflammation is to secrete inflammatory mediators from secretory vesicles. Intracellular synthesized inflammatory mediators are transported by vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) to vesicles where they are stored. After stimulation, the contents of the secretory vesicles are released via exocytosis. This study established a high throughput imaging screening system to monitor the functions of secretory vesicles in mast cells, including molecular uptake via VMAT2 and the exocytotic process, by using a novel fluorescent probe, FFN206, which was developed as a VMAT2 substrate. After loading with FFN206, the rapid uptake of FFN206 was observed and secretory vesicles in mouse bone marrow derived mast cells and a cultured mast cell line were clearly visualized. FFN206 uptake by secretory vesicles was time-dependent and was blocked by reserpine. Furthermore, exocytotic trafficking was monitored dynamically by real-time high-throughput fluorescence quantitation. In the present study, we verified the application of FFN206 for the monitoring of functional vesicles. This high-throughput screening system may benefit instinctive drug evaluation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>b99e2aa8</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198785</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0be:2835af05</id><author><name>Takeshi Kiyoi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Kiyoi, Shuang Liu, Muhammad Novrizal Abdi Sahid, Masachika Shudou, Kazutaka Maeyama, Masaki Mogi&lt;/p&gt;

Many non-selective NMDAR-targeting drugs are poorly tolerated, leading to efforts to target NMDAR subtypes to improve the therapeutic index. We describe here a series of negative allosteric NMDAR modulators with submaximal inhibition at saturating concentrations. Modest changes to the chemical structure interconvert negative and positive modulation. All modulators share the ability to enhance agonist potency and are use-dependent, requiring the binding of both agonists before modulators act with high potency. Data suggest that these modulators, including both enantiomers, bind to the same site on the receptor and share structural determinants of action. Due to the modulator properties, submaximal negative modulators in this series may spare NMDAR at the synapse, while augmenting the response of NMDAR in extrasynaptic spaces.

Many non-selective NMDAR-targeting drugs are poorly tolerated, leading to efforts to target NMDAR subtypes to improve the therapeutic index. We describe here a series of negative allosteric NMDAR modulators with submaximal inhibition at saturating concentrations. Modest changes to the chemical structure interconvert negative and positive modulation. All modulators share the ability to enhance agonist potency and are use-dependent, requiring the binding of both agonists before modulators act with high potency. Data suggest that these modulators, including both enantiomers, bind to the same site on the receptor and share structural determinants of action. Due to the modulator properties, submaximal negative modulators in this series may spare NMDAR at the synapse, while augmenting the response of NMDAR in extrasynaptic spaces. These modulators could serve as useful tools to probe the role of extrasynaptic NMDARs.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34711</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5558.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Structural basis for Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm formation [Microbiology]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5558</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/21/5558/F1.medium.gif</url><height>416</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5558.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Acinetobacter baumannii—a leading cause of nosocomial infections—has a remarkable capacity to persist in hospital environments and medical devices due to its ability to form biofilms.

Background &lt;p&gt;Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remains a major cause of admission and inpatient mortality worldwide in children aged less than 5 years. In this study, we explored SAM prevalence and outcomes in children admitted in 13 Kenyan hospitals participating in a Clinical Information Network (CIN). We also describe their immediate in-patient management.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data for children aged 1–59 months collected retrospectively from medical records after discharge. Mean, median and ranges were used to summarize pooled and age-specific prevalence and mortality associated with SAM. Documentation of key signs and symptoms (S/S) and performance of indicators of quality of care for selected aspects of the WHO management steps were assessed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between documented S/S and mortality among SAM patients aged 6–59 months. Loess curves were used to explore performance change over time for indicators of selected SAM management steps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;5306/54140 (9.8%) children aged 1–59 months admitted with medical conditions in CIN hospitals between December 2013 and November 2016 had SAM. SAM prevalence identified by clinicians and case fatality varied widely across hospitals with median proportion (range) of 10.1% (4.6–18.2%) and 14.8% (6.0–28.6%) respectively. Seventeen variables were associated with increased mortality. Performance change over time of management steps varied across hospitals and across selected indicators but suggests some effect of regular audit and feedback.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Identification of SAM patients, their mortality and adherence to in-patient management recommendations varied across hospitals. An important group of SAM patients are aged less than 6 months. Continued efforts are required to improve management of SAM in routine settings as part of efforts to reduce inpatient mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated><fingerprint>b46326de</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197607</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85435:93d646dc</id><author><name>Susan Gachau</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susan Gachau, Grace Irimu, Philip Ayieko, Samuel Akech, Ambrose Agweyu, Mike English, on behalf of the Clinical Information Network Author Group &lt;/p&gt;

For frozen-thawed embryos, the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample was equivalent between NIPGS vs. TE biopsy, NIPGS vs. WB and TE vs. WB samples taken from the same embryo was 87.5%; 96.4% and 91.7% respectively (P&gt;0.05), and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 99.3%, 99.7% and 99.7%, respectively (P&gt;0.05).

Our findings suggest that aneuploidy screening using BCCM combined with BF could potentially serve as a novel NIPGS approach for use in human IVF.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/fQsPaKVYCCQ/s41598-018-25870-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Oncotically Driven Control over Glycocalyx Dimension for Cell Surface Engineering and Protein Binding in the Longitudinal Direction</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25870-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25870_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>263</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25870-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25870-2</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oncotically Driven Control over Glycocalyx Dimension for Cell Surface Engineering and Protein Binding in the Longitudinal Direction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oncotically Driven Control over Glycocalyx Dimension for Cell Surface Engineering and Protein Binding in the Longitudinal Direction, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25870-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25870-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Oncotically Driven Control over Glycocalyx Dimension for Cell Surface Engineering and Protein Binding in the Longitudinal Direction&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/fQsPaKVYCCQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526367600000</published><fingerprint>28d3c634</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25870-2</link><crawled>1526377105209</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163632a4739:36d48b5:93d646dc</id><author><name>Erika M.

Background &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has conditionally recommended the use of sputum smear microscopy and culture examination for the monitoring of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment. We aimed to assess and compare the validity of smear and culture conversion at different time points during treatment for MDR-TB, as a prognostic marker for end-of-treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We undertook a retrospective observational cohort study using data obtained from Hunan Chest Hospital, China and Gondar University Hospital, Ethiopia. The sensitivity and specificity of culture and sputum smear conversion for predicting treatment outcomes were analysed using a random-effects generalized linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 429 bacteriologically confirmed MDR-TB patients with a culture and smear positive result were included. Overall, 345 (80%) patients had a successful treatment outcome, and 84 (20%) patients had poor treatment outcomes. The sensitivity of smear and culture conversion to predict a successful treatment outcome were: 77.9% and 68.9% at 2 months after starting treatment (difference between tests, p = 0.007); 95.9% and 92.7% at 4 months (p = 0.06); 97.4% and 96.2% at 6 months (p = 0.386); and 99.4% and 98.9% at 12 months (p = 0.412), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture non-conversion to predict a poor treatment outcome were: 41.6% and 60.7% at 2 months (p = 0.012); 23.8% and 48.8% at 4 months (p&amp;lt;0.001); and 20.2% and 42.8% at 6 months (p&amp;lt;0.001); and 15.4% and 32.1% (p&amp;lt;0.001) at 12 months, respectively. The sensitivity of culture and smear conversion increased as the month of conversion increased but at the cost of decreased specificity. The optimum time points after conversion to provide the best prognostic marker of a successful treatment outcome were between two and four months after treatment commencement for smear, and between four and six months for culture. The common optimum time point for smear and culture conversion was four months. At this time point, culture conversion (AU&lt;sub&gt;ROC&lt;/sub&gt; curve = 0.71) was significantly better than smear conversion (AU&lt;sub&gt;ROC&lt;/sub&gt; curve = 0.6) in predicting successful treatment outcomes (p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, the validity of smear conversion (AU&lt;sub&gt;ROC&lt;/sub&gt; curve = 0.7) was equivalent to culture conversion (AU&lt;sub&gt;ROC&lt;/sub&gt; curve = 0.71) in predicting treatment outcomes when demographic and clinical factors were included in the model. The positive and negative predictive values for smear conversion were: 57.3% and 65.7% at two months, 55.7% and 85.4% at four months, and 55.0% and 88.6% at six months; and for culture conversions it was: 63.7% and 66.2% at two months, 64.4% and 87.1% at four months, and 62.7% and 91.9% at six months, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The validity of smear conversion is significantly lower than culture conversion in predicting MDR-TB treatment outcomes. We support the WHO recommendation of using both smear and culture examination rather than smear alone for the monitoring of MDR-TB patients for a better prediction of successful treatment outcomes. The optimum time points to predict a future successful treatment outcome were between two and four months after treatment commencement for sputum smear conversion and between four and six months for culture conversion. The common optimum times for culture and smear conversion together was four months.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>6e2efdd2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197880</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f233e:2835af05</id><author><name>Kefyalew Addis Alene</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kefyalew Addis Alene, Kerri Viney, Hengzhong Yi, Emma S.

In this paper, we propose a novel classification model for automatically identifying individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) using retinal features from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images. Our classification method uses retinal features such as the thickness of the retina and the thickness of the individual retinal layers, and the volume of the pathologies such as drusen and hyper-reflective intra-retinal spots. We extract automatically, ten clinically important retinal features by segmenting individual SD-OCT images for classification purposes. The effectiveness of the extracted features is evaluated using several classification methods such as Random Forrest on 251 (59 normal, 177 AMD and 15 DME) subjects. We have performed 15-fold cross-validation tests for three phenotypes; DME, AMD and normal cases using these data sets and achieved accuracy of more than 95% on each data set with the classification method using Random Forrest. When we trained the system as a two-class problem of normal and eye with pathology, using the Random Forrest classifier, we obtained an accuracy of more than 96%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) finds a value of 0.99 for each dataset. We have also shown the performance of four state-of-the-methods for classification the eye participants and found that our proposed method showed the best accuracy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>e4cdf13a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198281</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b787:3dd877af</id><author><name>Md Akter Hussain</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Md Akter Hussain, Alauddin Bhuiyan, Chi D.

Consistent with the view that disgust might be involved in persistent body dissatisfaction, there is preliminary evidence showing a positive correlation between measures of negative body image and indices of both trait disgust and self-directed disgust. In two correlational studies among undergraduates (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 577 and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 346, respectively) we aimed at replicating and extending these findings by testing a series of critical relationships, which follow from our hypotheses that 1) trait disgust propensity would increase the risk of developing a negative body image by increasing the likelihood of feeling self-disgust, and 2) trait disgust sensitivity would heighten the impact of self-disgust on the development of persistent negative body appraisals. Replicating previous research, both studies showed that negative body image was positively related to self-disgust, disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. Mediation analyses showed that, in line with our model, self-disgust partly accounted for the association between disgust propensity and negative body image. Although disgust sensitivity showed an independent relationship with body image, disgust sensitivity did not moderate the association between self-disgust and negative body image. All in all, findings are consistent with the view that self-disgust-induced avoidance may contribute to persistent negative body appraisals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>f34a3b45</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198532</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd0:3dd877af</id><author><name>Paula von Spreckelsen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paula von Spreckelsen, Klaske A.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;tuberous sclerosis complex 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TSC2)&lt;/i&gt;, a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like Growth Factor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-null and &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse &lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt; homolog &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt;, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We extended transcript-level findings to protein level, observing increased Igf2 protein expression and Igf2 secretion by &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. Increased Igf2 expression was not due to epigenetic imprinting, but was partially mediated through the Stat3 pathway and was completely insensitive to rapamycin treatment. An siRNA-mediated decrease of Igf2 resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting presence of an autocrine Igf2/Stat3 amplification cycle in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. In human pulmonary LAM lesions and metastatic cell clusters, high levels of IGF2 were associated with mTORC1 activation. In addition, treatment of three primary IGF2-expressing LAM lung cell lines with rapamycin did not result in IGF2 level changes. Thus, targeting of IGF2 signaling may be of therapeutic value to LAM patients, particularly those who are unresponsive to rapamycin.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>8f64c6de</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197105</link><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd2:2835af05</id><author><name>Blanca E.

Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 72.71% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 86.64%, indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq (pred) is 67.45%, which is not very high, indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 73.32% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 79.49%, indicating that 79.49% of the response variability can be explained by the model. Using the optimization software MODE Frontier (Optimization, MOGA-II, 2014), four types of response surfaces for the three considered response variables were tested for the data of DOE. The parameter values obtained using the proposed experimental design methodology result in better graphics quality, and other necessary design attributes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>828ae9b1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197673</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2330:2835af05</id><author><name>Mustufa Haider Abidi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mustufa Haider Abidi, Abdulrahman Al-Ahmari, Ali Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding what determines species’ geographic distributions is crucial for assessing global change threats to biodiversity. Measuring limits on distributions is usually, and necessarily, done with data at large geographic extents and coarse spatial resolution. However, survival of individuals is determined by processes that happen at small spatial scales. The relative abundance of coexisting species (i.e. ‘community structure’) reflects assembly processes occurring at small scales, and are often available for relatively extensive areas, so could be useful for explaining species distributions. We demonstrate that Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) can overcome several challenges to including community structure into studies of species distributions, despite having been little used to date. We hypothesized that the relative abundance of coexisting species can improve predictions of species distributions. In 1570 assemblages of 68 Mediterranean woody plant species we used BNI to incorporate community structure into Species Distribution Models (SDMs), alongside environmental information. Information on species associations improved SDM predictions of community structure and species distributions moderately, though for some habitat specialists the deviance explained increased by up to 15%. We demonstrate that most species associations (95%) were positive and occurred between species with ecologically similar traits. This suggests that SDM improvement could be because species co-occurrences are a proxy for local ecological processes. Our study shows that Bayesian Networks, when interpreted carefully, can be used to include local conditions into measurements of species’ large-scale distributions, and this information can improve the predictions of species distributions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>a01c6413</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197877</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f233d:2835af05</id><author><name>Alicia Montesinos-Navarro</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Montesinos-Navarro, Alba Estrada, Xavier Font, Miguel G.

Accurate characterization of morphological variation is crucial for generating reliable results and conclusions concerning changes and differences in form. Despite the prevalence of landmark-based geometric morphometric (GM) data in the scientific literature, a formal treatment of whether sampled landmarks adequately capture shape variation has remained elusive. Here, I introduce LaSEC (Landmark Sampling Evaluation Curve), a computational tool to assess the fidelity of morphological characterization by landmarks. This task is achieved by calculating how subsampled data converge to the pattern of shape variation in the full dataset as landmark sampling is increased incrementally. While the number of landmarks needed for adequate shape variation is dependent on individual datasets, LaSEC helps the user (1) identify under- and oversampling of landmarks; (2) assess robustness of morphological characterization; and (3) determine the number of landmarks that can be removed without compromising shape information. In practice, this knowledge could reduce time and cost associated with data collection, maintain statistical power in certain analyses, and enable the incorporation of incomplete, but important, specimens to the dataset. Results based on simulated shape data also reveal general properties of landmark data, including statistical consistency where sampling additional landmarks has the tendency to asymptotically improve the accuracy of morphological characterization. As landmark-based GM data become more widely adopted, LaSEC provides a systematic approach to evaluate and refine the collection of shape data––a goal paramount for accumulation and analysis of accurate morphological information.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>27613311</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198341</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b788:3dd877af</id><author><name>Akinobu Watanabe</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akinobu Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;

Spices and herbs are key dietary ingredients used across cultures worldwide. Beyond their use as flavoring and coloring agents, the popularity of these aromatic plant products in culinary preparations has been attributed to their antimicrobial properties. Last few decades have witnessed an exponential growth of biomedical literature investigating the impact of spices and herbs on health, presenting an opportunity to mine for patterns from empirical evidence. Systematic investigation of empirical evidence to enumerate the health consequences of culinary herbs and spices can provide valuable insights into their therapeutic utility. We implemented a text mining protocol to assess the health impact of spices by assimilating, both, their positive and negative effects. We conclude that spices show broad-spectrum benevolence across a range of disease categories in contrast to negative effects that are comparatively narrow-spectrum. We also implement a strategy for disease-specific culinary recommendations of spices based on their therapeutic tradeoff against adverse effects. Further by integrating spice-phytochemical-disease associations, we identify bioactive spice phytochemicals potentially involved in their therapeutic effects. Our study provides a systems perspective on health effects of culinary spices and herbs with applications for dietary recommendations as well as identification of phytochemicals potentially involved in underlying molecular mechanisms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>b9b103da</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198030</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1b:3dd877af</id><author><name>N.

We fitted negative binomial regression models with covariate adjustment to all data, as well as similar models by basic cause of death and by weekdays/weekends. The outcome was the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), defined as the number of deaths occurred per 100,000 live births.

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP. For this purpose, CR stimulation was applied with Rapidly Varying Sequences (RVS) as well as with Slowly Varying Sequences (SVS) in a wide range of stimulation frequencies and intensities. Our findings demonstrate that acute desynchronization, achieved during stimulation, does not necessarily lead to long-term desynchronization after cessation of stimulation. By comparing the long-term effects of the two different CR protocols, the RVS CR stimulation turned out to be more robust against variations of the stimulation frequency. However, SVS CR stimulation can obtain stronger anti-kindling effects. We revealed specific parameter ranges that are favorable for long-term desynchronization. For instance, RVS CR stimulation at weak intensities and with stimulation frequencies in the range of the neuronal firing rates turned out to be effective and robust, in particular, if no closed loop adaptation of stimulation parameters is (technically) available. From a clinical standpoint, this may be relevant in the context of both invasive as well as non-invasive CR stimulation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rx9Yjw7JXhk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>3</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>4ae91fb0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006113</link><crawled>1525975049460</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e3b:abeb7260</id><author><name>Thanos Manos</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thanos Manos, Magteld Zeitler, Peter A.

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient’s life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (post-treatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48).

REEs in the environment can be absorbed by plants and sequestered by plant phytoliths. Acid rain can directly or indirectly affect plant physiological functions. Currently, the effects of REEs and acid rain on phytolith-REEs complex in plants are not yet fully understood. In this study, a high-silicon accumulation crop, rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.), was selected as a representative of plants, and orthogonal experiments were conducted under various levels of lanthanum [La(III)] and pH. The results showed that various La(III) concentrations could significantly improve the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III) in germinated rice seeds. A pH of 4.5 promoted phytolith La(III) sequestration, while a pH of 3.5 inhibited sequestration. Compared with the single treatment with La(III), the combination of La(III) and acid rain inhibited the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III). Correlation analysis showed that the efficiency of phytolith La(III) sequestration had no correlation with the production of phytolith but was closely correlated with the sequestration of phytolith La(III) and the physiological changes of germinated rice seeds. Phytolith morphology was an important factor affecting phytolith La(III) sequestration in germinated rice seeds, and the effect of tubes on sequestration was more significant than that of dumbbells. This study demonstrated that the formation of the phytolith and La(III) complex could be affected by exogenous La(III) and acid rain in germinated rice seeds.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>2c3e3a09</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197365</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b83:93d646dc</id><author><name>Yong Si</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yong Si, Lihong Wang, Qing Zhou, Xiaohua Huang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;No evidence-based therapy exists for non-arteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO). Retinal ischemic tolerance is low; irreversible damage occurs within four hours of experimental NA-CRAO. In previous randomized trials evaluating intra-arterial or intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in NA-CRAO, only one patient was treated this early. In December 2013, the Departments of Neurology &amp;amp; Stroke and Ophthalmology at University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany, decided to treat patients using IVT within 4.5 hours of NA-CRAO, the therapeutic window established for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive NA-CRAO patients with severe visual loss received IVT after exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up was conducted at day 5 (d5) and day 30 (d30). Visual outcomes were compared to the conservative standard treatment (CST) arm of the EAGLE-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Until August 2016, 20 patients received IVT within 4.5 hours after NA-CRAO with a median onset-to-treatment time of 210 minutes (IQR 120–240). Visual acuity improved from baseline mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 2.46±0.33 (SD) (light perception) to 1.52±1.09 (Snellen equivalent: 6/200) at d5 (p = 0.002) and 1.60±1.08 (Snellen equivalent: 6/240) at d30. Compared to the EAGLE CST-arm, functional recovery to reading ability occurred more frequently after IVT: 6/20 (30%) versus 1/39 (3%) at d5 (p = 0.005) and at d30 5/20 (25%) versus 2/37 (5%) (p = 0.045). Two patients experienced serious adverse events (one angioedema and one bleeding from an abdominal aortic aneurysm) but recovered without sequelae.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IVT within 4.5 hours after symptom onset may represent an effective treatment of NA-CRAO. Randomized trials are warranted to evaluate efficacy and safety of early IVT in acute NA-CRAO.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>584f808</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198114</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1e:3dd877af</id><author><name>Maximilian Schultheiss</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maximilian Schultheiss, Florian Härtig, Martin S.

Randomized trials are warranted to evaluate efficacy and safety of early IVT in acute NA-CRAO.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/871-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><title>Aluminum&apos;s breakup with fluoroalkenes</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/871.2.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/871-b?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527183688000</published><fingerprint>a02f48c8</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/871-b?rss=1</link><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce93f:3dd877af</id><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/2oC1ib8vPPM/s41598-018-26837-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Lycium barbarum polysaccharide encapsulated Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid Nanofibers: cost effective herbal medicine for potential application in peripheral nerve tissue engineering</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26837-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26837-z</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lycium barbarum polysaccharide encapsulated Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid Nanofibers: cost effective herbal medicine for potential application in peripheral nerve tissue engineering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lycium barbarum polysaccharide encapsulated Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid Nanofibers: cost effective herbal medicine for potential application in peripheral nerve tissue engineering, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26837-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26837-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Lycium barbarum polysaccharide encapsulated Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid Nanofibers: cost effective herbal medicine for potential application in peripheral nerve tissue engineering&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2oC1ib8vPPM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528268400000</published><fingerprint>288abb76</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26837-z</link><crawled>1528276870947</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163d4666723:5af44e8:3dd877af</id><author><name>Jing Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lycium barbarum polysaccharide encapsulated Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid Nanofibers: cost effective herbal medicine for potential application in peripheral nerve tissue engineering&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lycium barbarum polysaccharide encapsulated Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid Nanofibers: cost effective herbal medicine for potential application in peripheral nerve tissue engineering, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26837-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26837-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Lycium barbarum polysaccharide encapsulated Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid Nanofibers: cost effective herbal medicine for potential application in peripheral nerve tissue engineering&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2oC1ib8vPPM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05280-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Who gets credit?

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study investigated the prognostic role of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in patients with node negative, T1c triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from a nationwide cohort. In addition, the prognostic effect between 3 different chemotherapy regimens were compared in node-negative T1c TNBC patients by subgroup analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From the Korean breast cancer registry database, 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients were included in this study. Patients were categorized into four treatment groups according to chemotherapy regimen: (1) no chemotherapy, (2) adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), (3) adriamycin/epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU (FAC/FEC), and (4) cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU plus methotrexate (CMF). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated between each patient group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients, 1,006 received adjuvant chemotherapy, while 145 received no chemotherapy. Among the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy the distribution of regimens was: 586 AC, 168 FAC/FEC (126 FAC, 42 FEC), and 252 CMF. The mean follow-up time of the full study cohort was 87.98 ± 33.56 months (range = 6–192 months). Patients in the no chemotherapy group showed significantly worse OS compared to each chemotherapy regimen group. However, when OS was compared between each chemotherapy regimen, no significant difference was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study showed that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improved OS in T1c node negative TNBC patients, regardless of chemotherapy between AC, FAC/FEC, and CMF regimens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>cebf3dd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197523</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7be:2835af05</id><author><name>Seung Taek Lim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Taek Lim, Chan Heun Park, Sung Yong Kim, Seok Jin Nam, Eun Young Kang, Byung-In Moon, Hyouk Jin Lee, Ye Won Jeon, Hongki Gwak, Young Jin Suh&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of two forms (CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CuS); and Cu nanoparticles (CuNP)) and dosages (standard 6.5 mg/kg (H), half of the standard (L)) of additional dietary Cu administered to growing rats on gastrointestinal and hepatic function and morphology. Copper in the form of CuNP vs CuS caused lower Cu faecal/urinal excretion and increased Cu accumulation in the brain tissue. Hepatic high-grade hydropic degeneration and necrotic lesions were observed only in the CuNP-H animals. In the lower gut, the dietary application of CuNP stifled bacterial enzymatic activity of caecal gut microbiota and resulted in lower SCFA production. That diminishing effect of CuNP on caecal microbiota activity was accompanied by a relative increase in the secretion of glycoside hydrolases by bacterial cells.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of two forms (CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CuS); and Cu nanoparticles (CuNP)) and dosages (standard 6.5 mg/kg (H), half of the standard (L)) of additional dietary Cu administered to growing rats on gastrointestinal and hepatic function and morphology. Copper in the form of CuNP vs CuS caused lower Cu faecal/urinal excretion and increased Cu accumulation in the brain tissue. Hepatic high-grade hydropic degeneration and necrotic lesions were observed only in the CuNP-H animals. In the lower gut, the dietary application of CuNP stifled bacterial enzymatic activity of caecal gut microbiota and resulted in lower SCFA production. That diminishing effect of CuNP on caecal microbiota activity was accompanied by a relative increase in the secretion of glycoside hydrolases by bacterial cells. The results showed that in comparison to Cu from CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cu nanoparticles to a greater extent were absorbed from the intestine, accumulated in brain tissue, exerted antimicrobial effect in the caecum, and at higher dietary dose caused damages in the liver of rats.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Physics, Applied</item></keywords><title>Imaging-based molecular barcoding with pixelated dielectric metasurfaces</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1105.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1105?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Metasurfaces provide opportunities for wavefront control, flat optics, and subwavelength light focusing.

Seizures occur in a recurrent manner with intermittent states of interictal and ictal discharges (IIDs and IDs). The transitions to and from IDs are determined by a set of processes, including synaptic interaction and ionic dynamics. Although mathematical models of separate types of epileptic discharges have been developed, modeling the transitions between states remains a challenge. A simple generic mathematical model of seizure dynamics (Epileptor) has recently been proposed by Jirsa et al. (2014); however, it is formulated in terms of abstract variables. In this paper, a minimal population-type model of IIDs and IDs is proposed that is as simple to use as the Epileptor, but the suggested model attributes physical meaning to the variables. The model is expressed in ordinary differential equations for extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium concentrations, membrane potential, and short-term synaptic depression variables. A quadratic integrate-and-fire model driven by the population input current is used to reproduce spike trains in a representative neuron. In simulations, potassium accumulation governs the transition from the silent state to the state of an ID. Each ID is composed of clustered IID-like events. The sodium accumulates during discharge and activates the sodium-potassium pump, which terminates the ID by restoring the potassium gradient and thus polarizing the neuronal membranes. The whole-cell and cell-attached recordings of a 4-AP-based in vitro model of epilepsy confirmed the primary model assumptions and predictions. The mathematical analysis revealed that the IID-like events are large-amplitude stochastic oscillations, which in the case of ID generation are controlled by slow oscillations of ionic concentrations. The IDs originate in the conditions of elevated potassium concentrations in a bath solution via a saddle-node-on-invariant-circle-like bifurcation for a non-smooth dynamical system. By providing a minimal biophysical description of ionic dynamics and network interactions, the model may serve as a hierarchical base from a simple to more complex modeling of seizures.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XazCEKR1hck&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>7</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>ad6cca5f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006186</link><crawled>1527788607719</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163b74c18e7:c75cd:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Anton V.

The adjusted mean utility values, calculated by EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-3L), of glaucoma patients according to patient demographics and measures of glaucoma severity were determined using multivariate linear regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean utility value of glaucoma patients was 0.8968. Patients aged 70 years or more had significantly lower utility value (0.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; value 0.005) compared to those aged less than 50 years (0.96). Patients within the lowest quartile of income had a utility value of 0.87, compared to a utility value of 0.96 for those within the highest quartile (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; value 0.001). Patients who were not married had lower utility value (0.87) compared to married patients (0.93).

The type C feruloyl esterase FoFaeC from &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; is a newly discovered enzyme with high potential for use in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass but it shows low activity towards sinapates. In this work, small molecule docking simulations were employed in order to identify important residues for the binding of the four model methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, methyl ferulate/caffeate/sinapate/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumarate, to the predicted structure of FoFaeC. Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme’ active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket. Five mutant clones and the wild type were produced in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt; and biochemically characterized. All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. Although the affinity of all mutant clones was improved against the four model substrates, the catalytic efficiency and turnover rate decreased for the substrates containing a hydroxyl substitution.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>58711df8</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198127</link><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4eb:3dd877af</id><author><name>Io Antonopoulou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Io Antonopoulou, Cameron Hunt, Gabriella Cerullo, Simona Varriale, Alexandra Gerogianni, Vincenza Faraco, Ulrika Rova, Paul Christakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>159</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>f5bc41f2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197046</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f71:2835af05</id><author><name>Rangarajan Sambathkumar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarajan Sambathkumar, Renate Akkerman, Sumitava Dastidar, Philip Roelandt, Manoj Kumar, Manmohan Bajaj, Ana Rita Mestre Rosa, Nicky Helsen, Veerle Vanslembrouck, Eric Kalo, Satish Khurana, Jos Laureys, Conny Gysemans, Marijke M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although many previous studies have examined the determinants of happiness in older adults, few have investigated the association between pension types and happiness. When compared to other conventional socioeconomic indicators, pension types may be more indicative of long-term socioeconomic status as they can reflect a person’s job history over their life course. This study examined the association between pension types and happiness in Japanese older people.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study were used to analyze the association between pension types and happiness. The study population comprised 120152 participants from 2013. We calculated the prevalence ratios of happiness for the different pension types using Poisson regression models that controlled for age, sex, marital status, equivalent income, wealth, education level, working status, occupation, depression, and social support.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After controlling for socioeconomic indicators, the prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of happiness for no pension benefits, low pension benefits, and moderate pension benefits relative to high pension benefits were 0.77 (0.73–0.81), 0.95 (0.94–0.97), and 0.98 (0.97–0.99), respectively. However, the inclusion of depression as a covariate weakened the association between pension types and happiness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While pension types were associated with happiness after adjusting for other proxy measures of socioeconomic status, the association diminished following adjustment for depression. Pension types may provide rich information on socioeconomic status and depression throughout the course of life.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;A number of video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) abnormalities have been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the most crucial finding of subsequent aspiration pneumonia has not been validated fully. We conducted a retrospective and case-control study to determine the clinically significant VFSS findings in this population, and to propose a practical scale for predicting aspiration pneumonia in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We enrolled 184 PD patients who underwent VFSS because of suspected dysphagia. The patients who developed aspiration pneumonia within six months of the VFSS were assigned as cases and the patients without aspiration pneumonia at six months were designated as controls. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the prognostic VFSS features based on the data of swallowing 3 mL of jelly, which were used to make a PD VFSS scale (PDVFS). The validity of the new PDVFS was evaluated by ROC analysis. Additionally, we used the survival time analysis to compare time to death between groups, stratified by the PDVFS score.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five patients developed aspiration pneumonia. Among the previously-proposed VFSS features, mastication, lingual motility prior to transfer, aspiration, and total swallow time were identified as significant prognostic factors. We combined these factors to form the PDVFS. The PDVFS score ranges from 0 to 12, with 12 being the worst. ROC analysis revealed 92% sensitivity and 82% specificity at a cutoff point of 3. The higher PDVFS group showed shorter time-to-death than the lower PDVFS group (log rank P = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our newly developed VFSS severity scale (based on jelly swallowing) for patients with PD was easy to rate and could predict subsequent aspiration pneumonia and poor prognosis in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>950d257d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197608</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f3f:2835af05</id><author><name>Satoshi Tomita</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Satoshi Tomita, Tomoko Oeda, Atsushi Umemura, Masayuki Kohsaka, Kwiyoung Park, Kenji Yamamoto, Hiroshi Sugiyama, Hideyuki Sawada&lt;/p&gt;

The main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a 12-week water aerobics program in a real-life context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults. Fifteen volunteers (58.80 ± 14.32 years old) were part of an experimental group (Exercise), and eight volunteers (59.00 ± 12.26 years old) were part of the control group (Control). The Exercise performed 45 min of water aerobics twice a week for 12 weeks; no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period. The evaluations were performed the week before (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry, lipid profile and blood pressure. Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in post-training moment. However, there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced body fat (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced systolic blood pressure (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.14) and triglycerides (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19) in Exercise. Within groups changes showed that the training program caused an increase mainly in explosive strength in the upper limbs (0.26 m, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.49; ES = 0.63) In addition, there was a significant decrease in fat mass (-0.89%, 95% CI, -1.74, -0.03; ES = 0.61) and in the systolic blood pressure (-0.83 mmHg, -1.46, -0.19; ES = 0.71). Nonetheless, no significant changes were observed for the lipid profile. These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>52</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>c1760e1d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198319</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b94f:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Henrique Pereira Neiva</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Henrique Pereira Neiva, Luís Brandão Faíl, Mikel Izquierdo, Mário C.

These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/2CiKSmRPNxc/acs.biochem.8b00193</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Catalytic Bases and Stereocontrol in Lamiaceae Class II Diterpene Cyclases</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00193/20180530/images/medium/bi-2018-00193x_0006.gif</url><height>186</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00193</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00193</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00193/20180530/images/medium/bi-2018-00193x_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00193&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

While previous studies have shown that human behavior adjusts in response to uncertainty, it is still not well understood how uncertainty is estimated and represented. As probability distributions are high dimensional objects, only constrained families of distributions with a low number of parameters can be specified from finite data. However, it is unknown what the structural assumptions are that the brain uses to estimate them. We introduce a novel paradigm that requires human participants of either sex to explicitly estimate the dispersion of a distribution over future observations. Judgments are based on a very small sample from a centered, normally distributed random variable that was suggested by the framing of the task. This probability density estimation task could optimally be solved by inferring the dispersion parameter of a normal distribution. We find that although behavior closely tracks uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis and resists an explanation with simple heuristics, it is hardly consistent with parametric inference of a normal distribution. Despite the transparency of the simple generating process, participants estimate a distribution biased towards the observed instances while still strongly generalizing beyond the sample. The inferred internal distributions can be well approximated by a nonparametric mixture of spatially extended basis distributions. Thus, our results suggest that fluctuations have an excessive effect on human uncertainty judgments because of representations that can adapt overly flexibly to the sample. This might be of greater utility in more general conditions in structurally uncertain environments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o3YR8jyibrQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>3880beff</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006205</link><crawled>1528135388145</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163cbf78bf1:de5cd6:c2c34441</id><author><name>Philipp Schustek</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Schustek, Rubén Moreno-Bote&lt;/p&gt;

Describing and understanding close proximity interactions between infant and family members can provide key information on transmission opportunities of respiratory infections within households. Among respiratory infections, pertussis represents a public health priority. Pertussis infection can be particularly harmful to young, unvaccinated infants and for these patients, family members represent the main sources of transmission. Here, we report on the use of wearable proximity sensors based on RFID technology to measure face-to-face proximity between family members within 16 households with infants younger than 6 months for 2–5 consecutive days of data collection. The sensors were deployed over the course of approximately 1 year, in the context of a national research project aimed at the improvement of infant pertussis prevention strategies. We investigated differences in close-range interactions between family members and we assessed whether demographic variables or feeding practices affect contact patterns between parents and infants. A total of 5,958 contact events were recorded between 55 individuals: 16 infants, 4 siblings, 31 parents and 4 grandparents. The aggregated contact networks, obtained for each household, showed a heterogeneous distribution of the cumulative time spent in proximity with the infant by family members. Contact matrices defined by age and by family role showed that most of the contacts occurred between the infant and other family members (70%), while 30% of contacts was among family members (infants excluded). Many contacts were observed between infants and adults, in particular between infant and mother, followed by father, siblings and grandparents. A larger number of contacts and longer contact durations between infant and other family members were observed in families adopting exclusive breastfeeding, compared to families in which the infant receives artificial or mixed feeding. Our results demonstrate how a high-resolution measurement of contact matrices within infants’ households is feasible using wearable proximity sensing devices. Moreover, our findings suggest the mother is responsible for the large majority of the infant’s contact pattern, thus being the main potential source of infection for a transmissible disease. As the contribution to the infants’ contact pattern by other family members is very variable, vaccination against pertussis during pregnancy is probably the best strategy to protect young, unvaccinated infants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>92622ee7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198733</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b314:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Laura Ozella</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Ozella, Francesco Gesualdo, Michele Tizzoni, Caterina Rizzo, Elisabetta Pandolfi, Ilaria Campagna, Alberto Eugenio Tozzi, Ciro Cattuto&lt;/p&gt;

Despite their clear significance for fundamental cellular processes, the forces governing tRNA evolution are poorly understood. We present evidence that transcription-associated mutagenesis and strong purifying selection are key determinants of patterns of sequence variation within and surrounding tRNA genes in humans and diverse model organisms. Remarkably, the mutation rate at broadly expressed cytosolic tRNA loci is likely between seven and ten times greater than the nuclear genome average. Furthermore, evolutionary analyses provide strong evidence that tRNA genes, but not their flanking sequences, experience strong purifying selection, acting against this elevated mutation rate. We also find a strong correlation between tRNA expression levels and the mutation rates in their immediate flanking regions, suggesting a simple new method for estimating individual tRNA gene activity.

We present evidence that transcription-associated mutagenesis and strong purifying selection are key determinants of patterns of sequence variation within and surrounding tRNA genes in humans and diverse model organisms. Remarkably, the mutation rate at broadly expressed cytosolic tRNA loci is likely between seven and ten times greater than the nuclear genome average. Furthermore, evolutionary analyses provide strong evidence that tRNA genes, but not their flanking sequences, experience strong purifying selection, acting against this elevated mutation rate. We also find a strong correlation between tRNA expression levels and the mutation rates in their immediate flanking regions, suggesting a simple new method for estimating individual tRNA gene activity. Collectively, this study illuminates the extreme competing forces in tRNA gene evolution, and implies that mutations at tRNA loci contribute disproportionately to mutational load and have unexplored fitness consequences in human populations.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/0EX8AXnqDYo/s41467-018-04350-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Silicon-chip-based mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04350-1/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4350_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>273</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04350-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04350-1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silicon-chip-based mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silicon-chip-based mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04350-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04350-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dual-comb spectroscopy is a powerful tool for realizing rapid spectroscopic measurements with high sensitivity and selectivity.

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>47e98465</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506b:2835af05</id><author><name>Viktorija Ilieva</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;

As more large-scale, genome-wide, differential DNA methylation studies become available, tools such as ME-Class2 will prove invaluable to interpret epigenomic data and guide mechanistic studies into the function of 5hmC.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021785?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Au147 nanoparticles: Ordered or amorphous?</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021785?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527748243000</published><fingerprint>e9379a9c</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021785?af=R</link><crawled>1527837712785</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163ba396191:3560d4b:3dd877af</id><author><name>Nathalie Tarrat</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05273-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Rush to protect lucrative antibody patents kicks into gear</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05273-z/d41586-018-05273-z_15789206.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05273-z</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rush to protect lucrative antibody patents kicks into gear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush to protect lucrative antibody patents kicks into gear, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05273-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05273-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A federal court decision has left universities and companies working to preserve intellectual property rights worth billions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>153</engagement><published>1527231600000</published><fingerprint>73154778</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05273-z</link><crawled>1527254654830</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16397789f6e:4209b1:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Heidi Ledford</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rush to protect lucrative antibody patents kicks into gear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush to protect lucrative antibody patents kicks into gear, Published online: 25 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05273-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05273-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A federal court decision has left universities and companies working to preserve intellectual property rights worth billions.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197923</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Influence of uncertainty on framed decision-making with moral dilemma</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197923</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197923</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gaëtan Merlhiot, Martial Mermillod, Jean-Luc Le Pennec, Frédéric Dutheil, Laurie Mondillon&lt;/p&gt;
In cases of impending natural disasters, most events are uncertain and emotionally relevant, both critical factors for decision-making. Moreover, for exposed individuals, the sensitivity to the framing of the consequences (gain or loss) and the moral judgments they have to perform (e.g., evacuate or help an injured person) constitute two central effects that have never been examined in the same context of decision-making. In a framed decision-making task with moral dilemma, we investigated whether uncertainty (i.e., unpredictably of events) and a threatening context would influence the framing effect (actions framed in loss are avoided in comparison to the ones framed in gain) and the personal intention effect (unintentional actions are more morally acceptable in comparison to intentional actions) on the perceived moral acceptability of taking action. Considering the impact of uncertainty and fear on the processes underlying these effects, we assumed that these emotions would lead to the negation of the two effects. Our results indicate that the exposure to uncertain events leads to the negation of the framing effect, but does not influence the moral acceptability and the effect of personal intention. We discuss our results in the light of dual-process models (i.e. systematic &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. heuristic), appraisal theories, and neurocognitive aspects.

The study of plant remains in archaeological sites, along with a better understanding of the use of plants by prehistoric populations, can help us shed light on changes in survival strategies of hunter-gatherers and consequent impacts on modern human cognition, social organization, and technology. The archaeological locality of Pinnacle Point (Mossel Bay, South Africa) includes a series of coastal caves, rock-shelters, and open-air sites with human occupations spanning the Acheulian through Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA). These sites have provided some of the earliest evidence for complex human behaviour and technology during the MSA. We used phytoliths—amorphous silica particles that are deposited in cells of plants—as a proxy for the reconstruction of past human plant foraging strategies on the south coast of South Africa during the Middle and Late Pleistocene, emphasizing the use and control of fire as well as other possible plant uses. We analysed sediment samples from the different occupation periods at the rock shelter Pinnacle Point 5–6 North (PP5-6N). We also present an overview of the taphonomic processes affecting phytolith preservation in this site that will be critical to conduct a more reliable interpretation of the original plant use in the rock shelter. Our study reports the first evidence of the intentional gathering and introduction into living areas of plants from the Restionaceae family by MSA hunter-gatherers inhabiting the south coast of South Africa.

The study of plant remains in archaeological sites, along with a better understanding of the use of plants by prehistoric populations, can help us shed light on changes in survival strategies of hunter-gatherers and consequent impacts on modern human cognition, social organization, and technology. The archaeological locality of Pinnacle Point (Mossel Bay, South Africa) includes a series of coastal caves, rock-shelters, and open-air sites with human occupations spanning the Acheulian through Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA). These sites have provided some of the earliest evidence for complex human behaviour and technology during the MSA. We used phytoliths—amorphous silica particles that are deposited in cells of plants—as a proxy for the reconstruction of past human plant foraging strategies on the south coast of South Africa during the Middle and Late Pleistocene, emphasizing the use and control of fire as well as other possible plant uses. We analysed sediment samples from the different occupation periods at the rock shelter Pinnacle Point 5–6 North (PP5-6N). We also present an overview of the taphonomic processes affecting phytolith preservation in this site that will be critical to conduct a more reliable interpretation of the original plant use in the rock shelter. Our study reports the first evidence of the intentional gathering and introduction into living areas of plants from the Restionaceae family by MSA hunter-gatherers inhabiting the south coast of South Africa. We suggest that humans inhabiting Pinnacle Point during short-term occupation events during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 built fast fires using mainly grasses with some wood from trees and/or shrubs for specific purposes, perhaps for shellfish cooking. With the onset of MIS 4 we observed a change in the plant gathering strategies towards the intentional and intensive exploitation of dry wood to improve, we hypothesise, combustion for heating silcrete. This human behaviour is associated with changes in stone tool technology, site occupation intensity and climate change.</description><engagementRate>3.0</engagementRate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/pdPg0nksqco/s41598-018-26960-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Author Correction: Consumption of vegetables and fruits and breast cancer survival: a systematic review and meta-analysis</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26960-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26960-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Consumption of vegetables and fruits and breast cancer survival: a systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Consumption of vegetables and fruits and breast cancer survival: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Published online: 01 June 2018;

Physical function was assessed using the Function Component of the Late-life Function and Disability Instrument and compared between men and women. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine associations between multimorbidity and different physical function domains for all participants, and in men and women separately.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of multimorbidity in the study population was 35.0% for adults aged 21 years and above, with no differences between men and women. Multimorbidity was associated with reduced upper extremity function, basic and advanced lower extremity function, and overall function in men and women after adjusting for demographic factors. Multimorbidity had a stronger association with advanced lower extremity function and overall physical function in women than in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings of this study indicate that multimorbidity is associated with physical function domains in men and women, and in particular advanced lower extremity for women. Effective community-based interventions need to be implemented to preserve physical function in individuals with multimorbidity to keep them functionally independent and physically active in the community.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Epiretinal traction is not responsible only for epiretinal but also intraretinal changes. This study aims to describe structural and vascular intraretinal changes after macular peeling in idiopathic (iERM) vs diabetic ERM (dERM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001). The GFAP expression was significantly higher in dERMs (p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The intraretinal changes are different in iERMs and dERMs, as increased expression of CEIFLs in iERMs vs ICs in dERMs. The CEIFLs are associated with worse anatomical and functional outcomes in iERMs, whereas GFAP espression in peeled ILMs is higher in dERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>4fa76ee6</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197065</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475067:2835af05</id><author><name>Mario R.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Epiretinal traction is not responsible only for epiretinal but also intraretinal changes. This study aims to describe structural and vascular intraretinal changes after macular peeling in idiopathic (iERM) vs diabetic ERM (dERM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001). The GFAP expression was significantly higher in dERMs (p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The intraretinal changes are different in iERMs and dERMs, as increased expression of CEIFLs in iERMs vs ICs in dERMs. The CEIFLs are associated with worse anatomical and functional outcomes in iERMs, whereas GFAP espression in peeled ILMs is higher in dERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/nIECI82EcVY/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00153</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] In Vitro Dissolution as a Tool for Formulation Selection: Telmisartan Two-Step IVIVC</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00153/20180517/images/medium/mp-2018-001532_0011.gif</url><height>260</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00153</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00153</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00153/20180517/images/medium/mp-2018-001532_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00153&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>64e44128</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197343</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b81:93d646dc</id><author><name>Jinju Ma</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinju Ma, Liyi Ma, Hong Zhang, Zhongquan Zhang, Youqiong Wang, Kai Li, Xiaoming Chen&lt;/p&gt;

While many tropical countries are experiencing rapid deforestation, some have experienced forest transition (FT) from net deforestation to net reforestation. Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980–2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>1730ca12</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b89:93d646dc</id><author><name>Nobuo Imai</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nobuo Imai, Takuya Furukawa, Riyou Tsujino, Shumpei Kitamura, Takakazu Yumoto&lt;/p&gt;

These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05270-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Online petition seeks fresh standards for professional conduct.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>23</engagement><published>1527663600000</published><fingerprint>ea12ac1b</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2</link><crawled>1527678911241</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163b0c24309:262af12:3dd877af</id><author><name>NA</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands urge US science academy to revoke membership for sexual harassers, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05270-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05270-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Online petition seeks fresh standards for professional conduct.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197383</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>PROGame: A process framework for serious game development for motor rehabilitation therapy</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197383</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197383</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Esperança Amengual Alcover, Antoni Jaume-i-Capó, Biel Moyà-Alcover&lt;/p&gt;
Serious game development for rehabilitation therapy is becoming increasingly popular because of the motivational advantages that these types of applications provide. Consequently, the need for a common process framework for this category of software development has become increasingly evident. The goal is to guarantee that products are developed and validated by following a coherent and systematic method that leads to high-quality serious games. This paper introduces a new process framework for the development of serious games for motor rehabilitation therapy. We introduce the new model and demonstrate its application for the development of a serious game for the improvement of the balance and postural control of adults with cerebral palsy. The development of this application has been facilitated by two technological transfer contracts and is being exploited by two different organizations. According to clinical measurements, patients using the application improved from high fall risk to moderate fall risk. We believe that our development strategy can be useful not only for motor rehabilitation therapy, but also for the development of serious games in many other rehabilitation areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>3b3feed1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197383</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b4:2835af05</id><author><name>Esperança Amengual Alcover</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Esperança Amengual Alcover, Antoni Jaume-i-Capó, Biel Moyà-Alcover&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b00931&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, you can do hydrogenation reactions in a stainless-steel ball mill, without any sort of noble-metal catalyst. The hydrogen is produced when you add some n-alkane or diethyl ether to the mix (these actually get converted to gaseous methane and hydrogen under the milling conditions). Some pretty severe reductions are realized, for example, taking biphenyl all the way down to 1-cyclohexylcyclohexane. Olefins go to alkanes under these conditions, of course, and ketones and alcohols tend to just get erased: it’s a bulldozer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although it’s surprising, this reaction isn’t quite as much voodoo as it might appear. Well, not more than any other hydrogenation, anyway. The ball mill is, of course, a sealed vessel, and the authors show that the lower-boiling additives seem to be more effective, presumably because they increase the internal pressure. And it’s not like there’s no catalyst present, because you have the stainless steel. If you use zirconium oxide balls instead of the steel alloy ones, for example, you get no hydrogenation at all. Adding bits of different metals back in showed that the chromium is what’s producing the hydrogen from the alkanes or ether, while the nickel is acting as the hydrogenation catalyst itself. The stainless-steel alloy itself (304 steel) was the most effective combination, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balls do get eroded a bit under the conditions, so what you’ve got is finely divided metals, under some heat from the mechanical energy of the milling, and under hydrogen pressure from the decomposition of the co-reactants. No wonder things get reduced! But it’s not a reaction that you would have predicted up front. And even if you’d stipulated that hydrogenation would start under these conditions, I don’t think you would have guessed how powerful it would be. The last time I hydrogenated down a whole aryl system (it’s been a while), I was running at something like 1600 psi (110 bar) at 120C with a rhodium catalyst, and the stuff came out looking – and smelling – like old lawnmower oil. This reaction probably doesn’t get above 60 degrees, by contrast. Admittedly, there’s no word in the paper about the appearance or aroma of the crude products, but I’m willing to bet that that part remains the same. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525866196000</published><fingerprint>1324d7a2</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13523</link><crawled>1525866557518</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16344bbf04e:ab482a:93d646dc</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>Here’s one to add to the “weird mechanosynthesis” pile.

Background &lt;p&gt;The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to considerable concerns about the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR). Sexual contact, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most prevalent form of HIV transmission in Shijiazhuang. Hence, we conducted an epidemiological surveillance study on TDR among newly diagnosed individuals who infected-HIV through sexual contact in from 2014–2015.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Genotypic resistance mutations were defined using the WHO-2009 surveillance list. Potential impact on antiretroviral drug was predicted according to the Stanford HIV db program version 7.0. The role of transmission clusters in drug resistant strains was evaluated by phylogenetic and network analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In this study, 589 individuals were recruited and 542 samples were amplified and sequenced successfully. The over prevalence of TDR was 6.1%: 1.8% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 2.0% to non- NRTIs (NNRTIs) and 2.4% to protease inhibitors (PIs), respectively. We did not find significant differences in the TDR prevalence by demographic and clinical characteristics (p &gt; 0.05). Using network and phylogenetic analysis, almost 60.0% sequences were clustered together. Of these clusters, 2 included at least two individuals carrying the same resistance mutation, accounting for 21.2% (7/33) individuals with TDR. No significant difference was observed in the clustering rate between the individuals with and without TDR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We obtained a moderate level TDR rate in studied region. These findings enhance our understanding of HIV-1 drug resistance prevalence in Shijiazhuang, and may be helpful for the comprehensive prevention and control of HIV-1.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>d27cb1a4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198005</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc1:3dd877af</id><author><name>Xianfeng Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xianfeng Wang, Xiaosong Liu, Feng Li, Hong Zhou, Jiefang Li, Yingying Wang, Lihua Liu, Shujun Liu, Yi Feng, Ning Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Annatto (&lt;i&gt;Bixa orellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is a tropical American crop, commercially valuable due to its application in the food and cosmetics industries as a natural dye. The wild ancestor of cultivated annatto is &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;orellana&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;urucurana&lt;/i&gt;. Although never cultivated, this variety occurs in open forests and anthropogenic landscapes, and is always associated with riparian environments. In this study, we evaluated the genetic diversity and structure of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;orellana&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;urucurana&lt;/i&gt; populations in Brazilian Amazonia using 16 microsatellite loci. We used Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) to characterize the potential geographical range of this variety in northern South America. We analyzed 170 samples from 10 municipalities in the states of Rondônia, Pará and Roraima. A total of 194 alleles was observed, with an average of 12.1 alleles per locus. Higher levels of expected (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) than observed (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;) heterozygosities were found for all populations. Bayesian analysis, Neighbor-Joining dendrograms and PCAs suggest the existence of three strongly structured groups of populations. A strong and positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances was found, suggesting that genetic differentiation might be caused by geographic isolation. From species distribution modelling, we detected that South Rondônia, Madre di Dios River basin, Llanos de Mojos, Llanos de Orinoco and eastern Ecuador are highly suitable areas for wild annatto to occur, providing additional targets for future exploration and conservation. Climatic adaptation analyses revealed strong differentiation among populations, suggesting that precipitation plays a key role in wild annatto’s current and potential distribution patterns.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>70e05085</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198593</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f53:2835af05</id><author><name>Gabriel Dequigiovanni</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Dequigiovanni, Santiago Linorio Ferreyra Ramos, Alessandro Alves-Pereira, Eliane Gomes Fabri, Doriane Picanço-Rodrigues, Charles Roland Clement, Paul Gepts, Elizabeth Ann Veasey&lt;/p&gt;

A strong and positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances was found, suggesting that genetic differentiation might be caused by geographic isolation. From species distribution modelling, we detected that South Rondônia, Madre di Dios River basin, Llanos de Mojos, Llanos de Orinoco and eastern Ecuador are highly suitable areas for wild annatto to occur, providing additional targets for future exploration and conservation. Climatic adaptation analyses revealed strong differentiation among populations, suggesting that precipitation plays a key role in wild annatto’s current and potential distribution patterns.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196863</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Detecting the contagion effect in mass killings; a constructive example of the statistical advantages of unbinned likelihood methods</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196863</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196863</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sherry Towers, Anuj Mubayi, Carlos Castillo-Chavez&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation.However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false.Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings. However, in 2017, Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek subsequently published a paper, based upon the same data, that claimed to contradict the results of the earlier study. The former used unbinned likelihood methods, and the latter used binned methods, and comparison of distribution moments.Using these analyses, we also discuss how visualization of the data can aid in determination of the most appropriate statistical analysis methods to distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis. We also discuss the importance of assessment of the robustness of analysis results to methodological assumptions made (for example, arbitrary choices of number of bins and bin widths when using binned methods); an issue that is widely overlooked in the literature, but is critical to analysis reproducibility and robustness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When an analysis cannot distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis, care must be taken to ensure that the analysis methodology itself maximizes the use of information in the data that can distinguish between the two hypotheses.The use of binned methods by Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek (2017), that examined how many mass killings fell within a 14 day window from a previous mass killing, substantially reduced the sensitivity of their analysis to contagion effects.

Prepartum supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) may influence lipolysis and hyperketonemia in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of prepartum CLA supplementation on lactation performance and serum fatty acids (FA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in early lactation dairy cows, and secondarily on reproductive performance. Multiparous cows were enrolled in the study at 18 days prior to expected calving date, and randomly assigned 100 g/day of Lutrell Pure (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; 75% FA), providing 10 g/day of each CLA isomer (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-10 &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-12 and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-9 &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-11 CLA) or equivalent amount of rumen inert fatty acids as control (78 g/day of Energy Booster 100; Milk Specialties Global, Eden Prairie, MN). Treatments were top dressed daily to individual cows from enrollment to calving and all cows were offered the same ration. Blood samples were collected on the first day of supplementation, 10 days prepartum, and 1, 7, 14, and 30 days postpartum. Hyperketonemia was defined as serum BHB ≥ 1.2 mM. Milk yield was recorded daily until 60 days postpartum and averaged weekly. Milk samples were obtained weekly for component analysis. Prepartum CLA supplementation tended to increase serum concentration of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and increased trans-10, cis-12 CLA prepartum. Cows supplemented with CLA had increased milk protein yield and tended to have increased milk fat yield and milk yield, which together resulted in greater energy content of milk. Cows supplemented with CLA had lower serum FA on day 1 and 7 postpartum and overall lower serum BHB postpartum, which resulted in decreased prevalence of hyperketonemia on day 14 postpartum. There were no differences in body condition score change, other health disorders, or reproductive outcomes by treatment. Together, these findings indicate that prepartum CLA supplementation may be a plausible strategy to positively influence postpartum performance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated><fingerprint>5cfc0803</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197733</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85441:93d646dc</id><author><name>Rafael Caputo Oliveira</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Caputo Oliveira, Ryan S.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Mucositis is a side effect of chemotherapy seen in the digestive tract, with symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, inflammation and ulcerations. Our aim was to investigate whether endogenous glucagon-like peptide -1 and -2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2) are implicated in intestinal healing after chemotherapy-induced mucositis.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We used a transgenic mouse model Tg(GCG.DTR)(Tg) expressing the human diphtheria toxin receptor in the proglucagon-producing cells. Injections with diphtheria toxin ablated the GLP-1 and GLP-2 producing L-cells in Tg mice with no effect in wild-type (WT) mice. Mice were injected with 5-fluorouracil or saline and received vehicle, exendin-4, teduglutide (gly2-GLP-2), or exendin-4/teduglutide in combination. The endpoints were body weight change, small intestinal weight, morphology, histological scoring of mucositis and myeloperoxidase levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ablation of L-cells led to impaired GLP-2 secretion; increased loss of body weight; lower small intestinal weight; lower crypt depth, villus height and mucosal area; and increased the mucositis severity score in mice given 5-fluorouracil. WT mice showed compensatory hyperproliferation as a sign of regeneration in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide rescued the body weight of the Tg mice and led to a hyperproliferation in the small intestine, whereas single treatment was less effective.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The ablation of L-cells leads to severe mucositis and insufficient intestinal healing, shown by severe body weight loss and lack of compensatory hyperproliferation in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide could prevent this. Because both peptides were needed, we can conclude that both GLP-1 and GLP-2 are essential for intestinal healing in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>4032f845</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198046</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b77f:3dd877af</id><author><name>Rasmus Hytting-Andreasen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rasmus Hytting-Andreasen, Emilie Balk-Møller, Bolette Hartmann, Jens Pedersen, Johanne Agerlin Windeløv, Jens Juul Holst, Hannelouise Kissow&lt;/p&gt;

WT mice showed compensatory hyperproliferation as a sign of regeneration in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide rescued the body weight of the Tg mice and led to a hyperproliferation in the small intestine, whereas single treatment was less effective.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The ablation of L-cells leads to severe mucositis and insufficient intestinal healing, shown by severe body weight loss and lack of compensatory hyperproliferation in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide could prevent this. Because both peptides were needed, we can conclude that both GLP-1 and GLP-2 are essential for intestinal healing in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/y9raujd3aY8/acs.jmedchem.8b00140</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] From Cancer to Pain Target by Automated Selectivity Inversion of a Clinical Candidate</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00140/20180523/images/medium/jm-2018-001408_0006.gif</url><height>194</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00140</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00140</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00140/20180523/images/medium/jm-2018-001408_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00140&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Determining how proteins interact to form stable complexes is of crucial importance, for example in the development of novel therapeutics. Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners, such as RosettaDock, might potentially emerge to become a promising alternative to traditional structure determination methods. However, while models virtually identical to the correct experimental structure can in some cases be generated, the main difficulty remains to discriminate correct or approximately correct models from decoys. This is due to the ruggedness of the free-energy landscape, the approximations intrinsic in the scoring functions, and the intrinsic flexibility of proteins. Here we show that molecular dynamics simulations performed starting from a number top-scoring models can not only discriminate decoys and identify the correct structure, but may also provide information on an initial map of the free energy landscape that elucidates the binding mechanism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nukuSUmhrVc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>4</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>3ed10a8b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006182</link><crawled>1528135388145</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163cbf78bf1:de5cd5:c2c34441</id><author><name>Filip Radom</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Filip Radom, Andreas Plückthun, Emanuele Paci&lt;/p&gt;

Overall, this work demonstrates how the ensemble nature of macromolecular structure, revealed here by multitemperature crystallography, can elucidate allosteric mechanisms and open new doors for long-range control of protein function.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36307</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/K2m7caRpHKo/acs.biochem.8b00393</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] An Efficient Method for the Expression and Purification of Aß(M1–42)</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00393/20180524/images/medium/bi-2018-003932_0006.gif</url><height>250</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00393</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00393</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00393/20180524/images/medium/bi-2018-003932_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00393&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In recent years, effective treatment of infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; has become challenging due to the ability of the bacterium to acquire or up-regulate antimicrobial resistance determinants. Two component signal transduction systems are known to regulate expression of virulence factors including multidrug efflux pumps. Here, we investigated the role of the AdeRS two component signal transduction system in regulating the AdeAB efflux system, determined whether AdeA and/or AdeB can individually confer antimicrobial resistance, and explored the interplay between pentamidine resistance and growth conditions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978. Results identified that deletion of &lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; affected resistance towards chlorhexidine and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, two previously defined AdeABC substrates, and also identified an 8-fold decrease in resistance to pentamidine. Examination of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt;, Δ&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and Δ&lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; cells augmented results seen for Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; and identified a set of dicationic AdeAB substrates. RNA-sequencing of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; revealed transcription of 290 genes were ≥2-fold altered compared to the wildtype. Pentamidine shock significantly increased &lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt; expression in the wildtype, but decreased it in Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt;, implying that AdeRS activates &lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; transcription in ATCC 17978. Investigation under multiple growth conditions, including the use of Biolog phenotypic microarrays, revealed resistance to pentamidine in ATCC 17978 and mutants could be altered by bioavailability of iron or utilization of different carbon sources. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>3be07326</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197412</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f81:2835af05</id><author><name>Felise G.

Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in &lt;i&gt;PIK3CA&lt;/i&gt; genes. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>41cf716b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475057:2835af05</id><author><name>Zixing Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zixing Wang, Kwok-Shing Ng, Tenghui Chen, Tae-Beom Kim, Fang Wang, Kenna Shaw, Kenneth L.

Honey from the European honeybee, &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;, is produced by α-glucosidases (HBGases) and is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Categorized by their substrate specificities, HBGases have three isoforms: HBGase I, II and III. Previous experimental investigations showed that wild-type HBGase III from &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; (WT) preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while the Y227H mutant (MT) preferred maltose to sucrose. This mutant can potentially be used for malt hydrolysis because it can efficiently hydrolyze maltose. In this work, to elucidate important factors contributing to substrate specificity of this enzyme and gain insight into how the Y227H mutation causes substrate specificity change, WT and MT homology models were constructed, and sucrose/maltose was docked into active sites of the WT and MT. AMBER14 was employed to perform three independent molecular dynamics runs for these four complexes. Based on the relative binding free energies calculated by the MM-GBSA method, sucrose is better than maltose for WT binding, while maltose is better than sucrose for MT binding. These rankings support the experimentally observed substrate specificity that WT preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while MT preferred maltose to sucrose, suggesting the importance of binding affinity for substrate specificity. We also found that the Y227H mutation caused changes in the proximities between the atoms necessary for sucrose/maltose hydrolysis that may affect enzyme efficiency in the hydrolysis of sucrose/maltose. Moreover, the per-residue binding free energy decomposition results show that Y227/H227 may be a key residue for preference binding of sucrose/maltose in the WT/MT active site. Our study provides important and novel insight into the binding of sucrose/maltose in the active site of &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; HBGase III and into how the Y227H mutation leads to the substrate specificity change at the molecular level. This knowledge could be beneficial in the design of this enzyme for increased production of desired products.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>4adb1200</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198484</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b78f:3dd877af</id><author><name>Pratchaya Pramoj Na Ayutthaya</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pratchaya Pramoj Na Ayutthaya, Chanpen Chanchao, Surasak Chunsrivirot&lt;/p&gt;

Loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in ischemic stroke victims initiates a devastating cascade of events causing brain damage. Maintaining the BBB is important to preserve brain function in ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only effective fibrinolytic treatment at the acute stage of ischemic stroke, also injures the BBB and increases the risk of brain edema and secondary hemorrhagic transformation. Thus, it is important to identify compounds that maintain BBB integrity in the face of ischemic injury in patients with stroke. We previously demonstrated that intravenously injected phosphorylated recombinant heat shock protein 27 (prHSP27) protects the brains of mice with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), an animal stroke-model. Here, we determined whether prHSP27, in addition to attenuating brain injury, also decreases BBB damage in hyperglycemic tMCAO mice that had received tPA. After induction of hyperglycemia and tMCAO, we examined 4 treatment groups: 1) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2) prHSP27, 3) tPA, 4) tPA plus prHSP27. We examined the effects of prHSP27 by comparing the BSA and prHSP27 groups and the tPA and tPA plus prHSP27 groups. Twenty-four hours after injection, prHSP27 reduced infarct volume, brain swelling, neurological deficits, the loss of microvessel proteins and endothelial cell walls, and mortality. It also reduced the rates of hemorrhagic transformation, extravasation of endogenous IgG, and MMP-9 activity, signs of BBB damage. Therefore, prHSP27 injection attenuated brain damage and preserved the BBB in tPA-injected, hyperglycemic tMCAO experimental stroke-model mice, in which the BBB is even more severely damaged than in simple tMCAO mice. The attenuation of brain damage and BBB disruption in the presence of tPA suggests the effectiveness of prHSP27 and tPA as a combination therapy. prHSP27 may be a novel therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke patients whose BBBs are injured following tPA injections.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>c43b30be</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198039</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e36:2835af05</id><author><name>Yoshiaki Shimada</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshiaki Shimada, Hideki Shimura, Ryota Tanaka, Kazuo Yamashiro, Masato Koike, Yasuo Uchiyama, Takao Urabe, Nobutaka Hattori&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Up to 25% of acute stroke patients first note symptoms upon awakening. We hypothesized that patients awaking with stroke symptoms may be safely treated with intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) using non-contrast head CT (NCHCT), if they meet all other standard criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The SAfety of Intravenous thromboLytics in stroke ON awakening (SAIL ON) was a prospective, open-label, single treatment arm, pilot safety trial of standard dose IV tPA in patients who presented with stroke symptoms within 0–4.5 hours of awakening. From January 30, 2013, to September 1, 2015, twenty consecutive wakeup stroke patients selected by NCHCT were enrolled. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in the first 36 hours. Secondary outcomes included NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours; and modified Rankin Score (mRS), NIHSS, and Barthel index at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The average age was 65 years (range 47–83); 40% were women; 50% were African American. The average NIHSS was 6 (range 4–11). The average time from wake-up to IV tPA was 205 minutes (range 114–270). The average time from last known well to IV tPA was 580 minutes (range 353–876). The median mRS at 90 days was 1 (range 0–5). No patients had sICH; two of 20 (10%) had asymptomatic ICH on routine post IV tPA brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Administration of IV tPA was feasible and may be safe in wakeup stroke patients presenting within 4.5 hours from awakening, screened with NCHCT. An adequately powered randomized clinical trial is needed.&lt;/p&gt; Clinical trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01643902.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>541a0ef5</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197714</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094062:2835af05</id><author><name>Victor C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Up to 25% of acute stroke patients first note symptoms upon awakening. We hypothesized that patients awaking with stroke symptoms may be safely treated with intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) using non-contrast head CT (NCHCT), if they meet all other standard criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The SAfety of Intravenous thromboLytics in stroke ON awakening (SAIL ON) was a prospective, open-label, single treatment arm, pilot safety trial of standard dose IV tPA in patients who presented with stroke symptoms within 0–4.5 hours of awakening. From January 30, 2013, to September 1, 2015, twenty consecutive wakeup stroke patients selected by NCHCT were enrolled. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in the first 36 hours. Secondary outcomes included NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours; and modified Rankin Score (mRS), NIHSS, and Barthel index at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The average age was 65 years (range 47–83); 40% were women; 50% were African American. The average NIHSS was 6 (range 4–11). The average time from wake-up to IV tPA was 205 minutes (range 114–270). The average time from last known well to IV tPA was 580 minutes (range 353–876). The median mRS at 90 days was 1 (range 0–5). No patients had sICH; two of 20 (10%) had asymptomatic ICH on routine post IV tPA brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Administration of IV tPA was feasible and may be safe in wakeup stroke patients presenting within 4.5 hours from awakening, screened with NCHCT. An adequately powered randomized clinical trial is needed.&lt;/p&gt; Clinical trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01643902.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301509%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D5766943211e18b3df68a188aecfabc41</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/24054712</streamId><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell Systems</title></origin><title>Defining Host Responses during Systemic Bacterial Infection through Construction of a Murine Organ Proteome Atlas</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471218301509</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>83d80438</fingerprint><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>375</width><url>http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2405471218301509-fx1.jpg</url><height>375</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301509%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D5766943211e18b3df68a188aecfabc41</originId><summary><content>Publication date: &lt;span&gt;23 May 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems, Volume 6, Issue 5&lt;br&gt; Author(s): John D.

A series of complex networks between host and pathogen drive invasive infections, which have not been comprehensively mapped.

We quantified over 11,000 proteins, defining organ-specific markers for all analyzed tissues. From this analysis, an atlas of dynamically regulated proteins and pathways was constructed.

Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal deaths. The aetiology of preeclampsia is largely unknown but a polygenetic component is assumed. To explore this hypothesis, we performed an in-depth whole-exome sequencing study in women with (cases, N = 50) and without (controls, N = 50) preeclampsia. The women were identified in an unselected cohort of 2,545 pregnant women based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Medical Birth Registry. Matching DNA was obtained from a biobank containing excess blood from routine antenatal care visits. Novogene performed the whole-exome sequencing blinded to preeclampsia status. Variants for comparison between cases and controls were filtered in the Ingenuity Variant Analysis software. We applied two different strategies; a &lt;i&gt;disease association panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included variants in single genes associated with established clinical risk factors for preeclampsia, and a &lt;i&gt;gene panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included biological pathways harbouring genes previously reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Variant variability was compared in cases and controls at the level of biological processes, signalling pathways, and in single genes. Regardless of the applied strategy and the level of variability examined, we consistently found positive correlations between variant numbers in cases and controls (all R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s&gt;0.88). Contrary to what was expected, cases carried fewer variants in biological processes and signalling pathways than controls (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values ≤0.02). In conclusion, our findings challenge the hypothesis of a polygenetic aetiology for preeclampsia with a common network of susceptibility genes. The greater genetic diversity among controls may suggest a protective role of genetic diversity against the development of preeclampsia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>10b8e987</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197217</link><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219b:93d646dc</id><author><name>Anette Tarp Hansen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anette Tarp Hansen, Jens Magnus Bernth Jensen, Anne-Mette Hvas, Mette Christiansen&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The nature of the relationship between fatigue and its risk factors is poorly understood. In the present study the genetic and environmental association between anxiety-depression, musculoskeletal (MS) pain and fatigue was examined, and the role of neuroticism as a shared risk factor that may possibly explain the co-occurrence between these phenotypes was investigated in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal twin design.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The sample consisted of 746 monozygotic (MZ) and 770 dizygotic (DZ) twins in the age group of 50–65 (mean = 57.11 years, SD = 4.5). Continuous measures of fatigue symptoms and the other phenotypes were employed. Using Cholesky modeling, genetic and environmental influences on the phenotypes, and the associations among them, were determined. Analyses were performed using measures of neuroticism obtained concurrently and 13–19 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Results from multiple regression analyses showed that neuroticism, anxiety-depression symptoms, and MS pain were all significantly associated with fatigue, controlling for sex, education, and general health indices. The best-fitting biometric models included additive genetic and individual-specific environmental effects. Heritabilities in the 0.40–0.53 range were demonstrated. Furthermore, while there was a considerable overlap in genetic risk factors between the four phenotypes, a substantial proportion of the genetic risk shared between anxiety-depression and fatigue, and between MS pain and fatigue, was independent of neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Evidence for a common underlying susceptibility to report fatigue symptoms, genetically linked to neuroticism, anxiety-depression, and MS pain, was found.

Background &lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown that the microbiome, namely &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; species, play a previously unrecognized role in both stable and exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Galactomannan is a major component of the &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; cell wall that has been widely used as a diagnostic marker.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To explore whether serum levels of &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen could be used to evaluate the risk of severe acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We measured the &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen levels of 191 patients with stable COPD, and examined its clinical relevance including AE-COPD.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 77 (40.3%) patients who were positive for serum &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen (≥0.5). High &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen level (≥0.7) was associated with older age and presence of bronchiectasis and cysts on computed tomography images. Compared to patients with low &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen level (&amp;lt;0.7), patients with high &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen level had significantly higher incidence of severe AE-COPD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0039, Gray’s test) and respiratory-related mortality (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0176, log-rank test).

Galactomannan is a major component of the &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; cell wall that has been widely used as a diagnostic marker.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To explore whether serum levels of &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen could be used to evaluate the risk of severe acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We measured the &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen levels of 191 patients with stable COPD, and examined its clinical relevance including AE-COPD.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 77 (40.3%) patients who were positive for serum &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen (≥0.5). High &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen level (≥0.7) was associated with older age and presence of bronchiectasis and cysts on computed tomography images. Compared to patients with low &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen level (&amp;lt;0.7), patients with high &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen level had significantly higher incidence of severe AE-COPD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0039, Gray’s test) and respiratory-related mortality (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0176, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis showed that high &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen level was independently associated with severe AE-COPD (hazard ratio, 2.162; 95% confidence interval, 1.267−3.692; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Serum &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen was detected in patients with COPD, and elevated serum &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen was associated with severe AE-COPD.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197421</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Optimal allocation of HIV prevention funds for state health departments</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197421</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197421</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emine Yaylali, Paul G.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal allocation shifted when there were differences in transmission category proportions and progress along the HIV care continuum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The robustness of the results suggests that most health departments can use these analyses to guide the investment of CDC HIV prevention funds into strategies to prevent the most new cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>681245ca</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197421</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b8:2835af05</id><author><name>Emine Yaylali</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emine Yaylali, Paul G.

The widespread use of social media has created a valuable but underused source of data for the environmental sciences. We demonstrate the potential for images posted to the website Twitter to capture variability in vegetation phenology across United States National Parks. We process a subset of images posted to Twitter within eight U.S. National Parks, with the aim of understanding the amount of green vegetation in each image. Analysis of the relative greenness of the images show statistically significant seasonal cycles across most National Parks at the 95% confidence level, consistent with springtime green-up and fall senescence. Additionally, these social media-derived greenness indices correlate with monthly mean satellite NDVI (r = 0.62), reinforcing the potential value these data could provide in constraining models and observing regions with limited high quality scientific monitoring.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>1de2ece1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197325</link><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ec:2835af05</id><author><name>Sam J.

Additionally, these social media-derived greenness indices correlate with monthly mean satellite NDVI (r = 0.62), reinforcing the potential value these data could provide in constraining models and observing regions with limited high quality scientific monitoring.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-g?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><title>A faster way to detect Zika in mosquitoes</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/870.7.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-g?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527183688000</published><fingerprint>5ed07fac</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-g?rss=1</link><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce94c:3dd877af</id><author><name>Benson, P.

Using cultivar resistance against pathogens is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly methods for control of crop diseases. However, cultivar resistance can be easily rendered ineffective due to changes in pathogen populations or environments. To test the hypothesis that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistance and quantitative resistance (QR) in one cultivar can provide more effective resistance than use of either type of resistance on its own, effectiveness of resistance in eight oilseed rape (&lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&lt;/i&gt;) cultivars with different &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR against &lt;i&gt;Leptosphaeria maculans&lt;/i&gt; (phoma stem canker) was investigated in 13 different environments/sites over three growing seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013). Cultivar Drakkar with no &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and no QR was used as susceptible control and for sampling &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations. Isolates of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from the 13 sites in 2010/2011 to assess frequencies of avirulent alleles of different effector genes (&lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt;) corresponding to the resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;) used in the field experiments. Results of field experiments showed that cultivars DK Cabernet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; + QR) and Adriana (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had significantly less severe phoma stem canker than cultivars Capitol (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;) and Bilbao (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt;), respectively. Results of controlled environment experiments confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR in these four cultivars. Analysis of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations from different sites showed that the mean frequencies of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt; (10%) and &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; (41%) were less than that of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt; (100%), suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistances were partially rendered ineffective while &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; resistance was still effective. Cultivar Excel (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had less severe canker than cultivar Roxet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;), but the difference between them was not significant due to influence of the effective resistance gene &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;. For the two cultivars with only QR, Es-Astrid (QR) had less severe stem canker than NK Grandia (QR). Analysis of the relationship between severity of stem canker and weather data among the 13 sites in the three growing seasons showed that increased severity of stem canker was associated with increased rainfall during the phoma leaf spot development stage and increased temperature during the stem canker development stage. Further analysis of cultivar response to environmental factors showed that cultivars with both an &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR (e.g. DK Cabernet, Adriana and Excel) were less sensitive to a change in environment than cultivars with only &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes (e.g. Capitol, Bilbao) or only QR (e.g. DK Grandia). These results suggest that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR can provide effective, stable control of phoma stem canker in different environments.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>f208ae10</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197752</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2335:2835af05</id><author><name>Yong-Ju Huang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yong-Ju Huang, Georgia K.

Our model simulation results suggest that the growth response of cell population upon externally applied mechanical stress is the same, as it can be quantitatively predicted using the same growth progression function.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4386.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Interaction between cardiac myosin-binding protein C and formin Fhod3 [Cell Biology]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4386</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4386.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Mutations in cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) are a major cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

One of the most relevant characteristics of the extant Southern Ocean fauna is its resiliency to survive glacial processes of the Quaternary. These climatic events produced catastrophic habitat reductions and forced some marine benthic species to move, adapt or go extinct. The marine benthic species inhabiting the Antarctic upper continental shelf faced the Quaternary glaciations with different strategies that drastically modified population sizes and thus affected the amount and distribution of intraspecific genetic variation. Here we present new genetic information for the most conspicuous regular sea urchin of the Antarctic continental shelf, &lt;i&gt;Sterechinus neumayeri&lt;/i&gt;. We studied the patterns of genetic diversity and structure in this broadcast-spawner across three Antarctic regions: Antarctic Peninsula, the Weddell Sea and Adélie Land in East Antarctica. Genetic analyses based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers suggested that &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;neumayeri&lt;/i&gt; is a single genetic unit around the Antarctic continent. The species is characterized by low levels of genetic diversity and exhibits a typical star-like haplotype genealogy that supports the hypothesis of a single &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; refugium. Based on two mutation rates standardized for this genus, the Bayesian Skyline plot analyses detected a rapid demographic expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum. We propose a scenario of rapid postglacial expansion and recolonization of Antarctic shallow areas from a less ice-impacted refugium where the species survived the LGM. Considering the patterns of genetic diversity and structure recorded in the species, this refugium was probably located in East Antarctica.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>75a44e08</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197611</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f40:2835af05</id><author><name>Angie Díaz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angie Díaz, Karin Gérard, Claudio González-Wevar, Claudia Maturana, Jean-Pierre Féral, Bruno David, Thomas Saucède, Elie Poulin&lt;/p&gt;

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Dye-less chromoendoscopy is an emerging technology for colorectal polyp characterization. Herein, we investigated whether the newly introduced I-scan optical enhancement (OE) can accurately predict polyp histology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in real-time.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective three-phased study, 84 patients with 230 diminutive colorectal polyps were included. During the first two study phases, five endoscopists assessed whether analysis of polyp colour, surface and vascular pattern under i-scan OE can differentiate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; between adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. Finally, junior and experienced endoscopists (JE, EE, each n = 4) not involved in the prior study phases made a post hoc diagnosis of polyp histology using a static i-scan OE image database. Histopathology was used as a gold-standard in all study phases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The overall accuracy of i-scan OE for histology prediction was 90% with a sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative prediction value (NPV) of 91%, 90%, 86% and 94%, respectively. In high confidence predictions, the diagnostic accuracy increased to 93% with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 94%, 91%, 89% and 96%. Colonoscopy surveillance intervals were predicted correctly in ≥ 90% of patients. In the post hoc analysis EE predicted polyp histology under i-scan OE with an overall accuracy of 91%. After a single training session, JE achieved a comparable diagnostic performance for predicting polyp histology with i-scan OE.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The histology of diminutive colorectal polyps can be accurately predicted with i-scan OE &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in real-time.

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls.

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329334v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Attend and Predict: Understanding Gene Regulation by Selective Attention on Chromatin [CONFIRMATORY RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/329334</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329334v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enable a flood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks.

The tertiary structure of proteins has been represented as a network, in which residues are nodes and their contacts are edges. Protein structure networks contain residues, called hubs or central, which are essential to form short connection pathways between any pair of nodes. Hence hub residues may effectively spread structural perturbations through the protein. To test whether modifications nearby to hub residues could affect the enzyme active site, mutations were introduced in the β-glycosidase Sfβgly (PDB-ID: 5CG0) directed to residues that form an α-helix (260–265) and a β-strand (335–337) close to one of its main hub residues, F251, which is approximately 14 Å from the Sfβgly active site. Replacement of residues A263 and A264, which side-chains project from the α-helix towards F251, decreased the rate of substrate hydrolysis. Mutation A263F was shown to weaken noncovalent interactions involved in transition state stabilization within the Sfβgly active site. Mutations placed on the opposite side of the same α-helix did not show these effects. Consistently, replacement of V336, which side-chain protrudes from a β-strand face towards F251, inactivated Sfβgly. Next to V336, mutation S337F also caused a decrease in noncovalent interactions involved in transition state stabilization. Therefore, we suggest that mutations A263F, A264F, V336F and S337F may directly perturb the position of the hub F251, which could propagate these perturbations into the Sfβgly active site through short connection pathways along the protein network.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>686e4bd7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198696</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f5a:2835af05</id><author><name>Valquiria P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Risky sexual behaviors adversely affect the health of youth and young adults exposing them to sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS and unwanted pregnancy to females that in turn lead to deleterious health, social and economic consequences. Youth centers inform their clients on sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancy, high risk abortion, and other reproductive health problems. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the prevalence of risky sexual behaviors among youth center reproductive health clinic users and non-users in Addis Ababa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A comparative cross-sectional study design was carried out among 524 youth in Addis Ababa from March to April, 2016. The data was entered in EPI-INFO 7 software; and cleaned and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. The prevalence was computed. Binary and multivariable logistic regression was done to determine the strength, direction and significance of association between youth center reproductive health clinic utilization and risky sexual behavior and to control confounder variables respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 524 youth with the response rate of 92% participated in the study. The overall prevalence of risky sexual behavior was 226 (43.1%) (With statistically significant difference in prevalence among users 101 (38.5%) and non-users 125 (47.7%) of youth center clinics, (p-value = 0.04). The odds of reporting risky sexual behavior was 60% higher among volunteers who did not use the reproductive health clinic, relative to those who did (AOR = 1.60; 95%CI = 1.08, 2.37). Teenagers aged 15–19 years were (AOR = 0.08; 95%CI = 0.05, 0.15) 92% less likely to practice risky sexual behavior compared to those aged 25–29 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Risky sexual behavior was statistically significantly higher among non-users of the youth center reproductive health clinic compared with the users. In addition, a substantial proportion of the youth engaged in different risky sexual behaviors that are evidenced by the existence of multiple sexual partners, sexual practice without condom and early sexual debut that might predispose youth to STIs including HIV infection and unwanted pregnancy. The ministry of health and its partners should strengthen youth center reproductive health clinics in urban, semi-urban and rural parts of Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>c61b07de</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198657</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:6683354:3dd877af</id><author><name>Nigusie Fetene</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nigusie Fetene, Wubegzier Mekonnen&lt;/p&gt;

Under light conditions favoring PSII excitation, the PSII antenna, light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), is phosphorylated and forms a supercomplex with PSI core and the PSI antenna, light-harvesting complex I (LHCI). Both LHCI and LHCII then transfer excitation energy to the PSI core.

Olive mill waste (OMW), a byproduct from the extraction of olive oil, causes serious environmental problems for its disposal, and extensive efforts have been made to find cost-effective solutions for its management. Biochars produced from OMW were applied as soil amendment and found in many cases to successfully increase plant productivity and suppress diseases. This work aims to characterize biochars obtained by pyrolysis of OMW at 300 °C to 1000 °C using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy, LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). Chemical characterization revealed that biochar composition varied according to the increase of pyrolysis temperature (PT). Thermal treated materials showed a progressive reduction of alkyl C fractions coupled to the enrichment in aromatic C products. In addition, numerous compounds present in the organic feedstock (fatty acids, phenolic compounds, triterpene acids) reduced (PT = 300 °C) or completely disappeared (PT ≥ 500 °C) in biochars as compared to untreated OMW. PT also affected surface morphology of biochars by increasing porosity and heterogeneity of pore size. The effects of biochars extracts on the growth of different organisms (two plants, one nematode and four fungal species) were also evaluated. When tested on different living organisms, biochars and OMW showed opposite effects. The root growth of &lt;i&gt;Lepidium sativum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Brassica rapa&lt;/i&gt;, as well as the survival of the nematode &lt;i&gt;Meloidogyne incognita&lt;/i&gt;, were inhibited by the untreated material or biochar produced at 300 °C, but toxicity decreased at higher PTs. Conversely, growth of &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rhizoctonia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; fungi was stimulated by organic feedstock, while being inhibited by thermally treated biochars.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to identify potential CpG site(s) or DNA methylation pattern(s) in the pseudo α-globin 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene), the gene which locates in α-thalassemia-1 deletion mutation, to differentiate plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;DNA methylation profiles of placenta and peripheral blood from the MethBase database were compared to screen differentially methylated regions. This region was confirmed the differential by methylation-sensitive high resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. The differential region was used to compare DNA methylation profile of plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women by bisulfite amplicon sequencing in three levels: overall, individual CpG sites and individual molecules (DNA methylation patterns).&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Using MethBase data, four consecutive CpG sites in the &lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene were identified as regions of differential DNA methylation between placenta and peripheral blood. The confirmation by MS-HRM showed the differential DNA methylation profile between the placenta and plasma from non-pregnant women. The comparison of DNA methylation profiles between the plasma of pregnant and non-pregnant women showed that, in the overall levels of the four CpG sites, DNA methylation of pregnant women was detected at lower levels than non-pregnant women. In the individual CpG site level, only the second CpG site showed differential DNA methylation between the groups. In the DNA methylation pattern level, there was no strongly significant differences in DNA methylation patterns between the pregnant and non-pregnant groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our result demonstrated that, in the plasma from pregnant women, only one of the four CpG sites displays a decrease in DNA methylation compared with non-pregnant women.

Tourette syndrome is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Comorbidities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder can be found. The overlap between neuroanatomical regions and neurotransmitter systems in the olfactory system and the pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome let us hypothesize altered olfactory performance in Tourette syndrome. The main objective of this study was to systematically assess olfactory functioning in subjects with Tourette syndrome and to compare it to healthy controls. We assessed 28 adults with Tourette syndrome (age 33.1±9.4 years, disease duration 23.7±9.7 years) and 28 healthy controls (age 32.9±9.0 years) matched in regard to age, sex, education and smoking habits. The “Sniffin Sticks” test battery was applied to assess odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. Additionally, the combined score of the odor threshold test, the odor discrimination test and the odor identification test of the “Sniffin Sticks” test battery was calculated. Although it was not the primary aim of this study, we assessed whether tics and comorbidity could contribute to olfactory alterations in adults with Tourette syndrome. Therefore, clinical scores were used to assess severity of tics and co-morbidity such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression in subjects with Tourette syndrome. Pathology of the nasal cavities was excluded with rhinoendoscopy. Independent sample t-tests were applied to compare performance in olfactory tests. In the case of statistically significant differences (critical p-value: 0.05), multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to explore whether tic severity, social impairment, co-morbidity or medical treatment had an impact on the differences found. Descriptive values are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Tourette syndrome subjects showed lower combined scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 31.9 ± 5.1 versus healthy controls 35.0 ± 3.1; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007), odor identification scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.4 ± 2.0 versus healthy controls 13.7 ± 1.4; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) and odor discrimination scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.1 ± 2.1 versus healthy controls 13.2 ± 1.6; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.041) in comparison to healthy subjects, while there was no difference in odor threshold (Tourette syndrome subjects 7.3 ± 2.7 versus healthy controls 8.1 ± 2.2; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.22). Seven out of 28 Tourette syndrome subjects (25%) scored in the range of the age- and sex-dependent combined score for hyposmia, while two of 28 healthy controls (7%) had a similar low combined score. None of the participants were found to have functional anosmia. Multiple linear regression analyses suggest that social impairment may a predictor for low combined score and odor identification score in Tourette syndrome subjects (p = 0.003). Compared to healthy controls, altered olfaction in adults with Tourette syndrome was found in this study. Normal odor threshold level but lower scores at tasks involving supra-threshold odor concentrations point towards a central-nervous alteration in the processing of olfactory information in Tourette syndrome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>739443e8</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197598</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f3e:2835af05</id><author><name>Martin Kronenbuerger</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martin Kronenbuerger, Patrizia Belenghi, Justus Ilgner, Jessica Freiherr, Thomas Hummel, Irene Neuner&lt;/p&gt;

We assessed 28 adults with Tourette syndrome (age 33.1±9.4 years, disease duration 23.7±9.7 years) and 28 healthy controls (age 32.9±9.0 years) matched in regard to age, sex, education and smoking habits. The “Sniffin Sticks” test battery was applied to assess odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. Additionally, the combined score of the odor threshold test, the odor discrimination test and the odor identification test of the “Sniffin Sticks” test battery was calculated. Although it was not the primary aim of this study, we assessed whether tics and comorbidity could contribute to olfactory alterations in adults with Tourette syndrome. Therefore, clinical scores were used to assess severity of tics and co-morbidity such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression in subjects with Tourette syndrome. Pathology of the nasal cavities was excluded with rhinoendoscopy. Independent sample t-tests were applied to compare performance in olfactory tests. In the case of statistically significant differences (critical p-value: 0.05), multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to explore whether tic severity, social impairment, co-morbidity or medical treatment had an impact on the differences found. Descriptive values are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Tourette syndrome subjects showed lower combined scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 31.9 ± 5.1 versus healthy controls 35.0 ± 3.1; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007), odor identification scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.4 ± 2.0 versus healthy controls 13.7 ± 1.4; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) and odor discrimination scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.1 ± 2.1 versus healthy controls 13.2 ± 1.6; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.041) in comparison to healthy subjects, while there was no difference in odor threshold (Tourette syndrome subjects 7.3 ± 2.7 versus healthy controls 8.1 ± 2.2; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.22). Seven out of 28 Tourette syndrome subjects (25%) scored in the range of the age- and sex-dependent combined score for hyposmia, while two of 28 healthy controls (7%) had a similar low combined score. None of the participants were found to have functional anosmia. Multiple linear regression analyses suggest that social impairment may a predictor for low combined score and odor identification score in Tourette syndrome subjects (p = 0.003). Compared to healthy controls, altered olfaction in adults with Tourette syndrome was found in this study. Normal odor threshold level but lower scores at tasks involving supra-threshold odor concentrations point towards a central-nervous alteration in the processing of olfactory information in Tourette syndrome.</description></item></channel></rss>
