We previously identified brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a source of sleep-inducing signals. Pharmacological activation of BAT enhances sleep while sleep loss leads to increased BAT thermogenesis. Recovery sleep after sleep loss is diminished in mice that lack uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and also in wild-type (WT) mice after sensory denervation of the BAT. Systemic inflammation greatly affects metabolism and the function of adipose tissue, and also induces characteristic sleep responses. We hypothesized that sleep responses to acute inflammation are mediated by BAT-derived signals. To test this, we determined the effects of systemic inflammation on sleep and body temperature in UCP-1 knockout (KO) and WT mice. Intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 beta and clodronate containing liposomes were used to induce systemic inflammation. In WT animals, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) was elevated in all four inflammatory models. All NREMS responses were completely abolished in UCP-1 KO animals. Systemic inflammation elicited an initial hypothermia followed by fever in WT mice. The hypothermic phase, but not the fever, was abolished in UCP-1 KO mice. The only recognized function of UCP-1 is to promote thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Present results indicate that the presence of UCP-1 is necessary for increased NREMS but does not contribute to the development of fever in systemic inflammation.</content></content><author><name>Éva Szentirmai</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Éva Szentirmai, Levente Kapás&lt;/p&gt;

Polymorphisms at &lt;i&gt;PRNP&lt;/i&gt; gene locus have been associated with resistance against classical scrapie in goats. Genetic selection on this gene within appropriate breeding programs may contribute to the control of the disease. The present study characterized the genetic profile of codons 146, 211 and 222 in three dairy goat breeds in Greece. A total of 766 dairy goats from seven farms were used. Animals belonged to two indigenous Greek, Eghoria (n = 264) and Skopelos (n = 287) and a foreign breed, Damascus (n = 215). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples from individual animals. Polymorphisms were detected in these codons using Real-Time PCR analysis and four different Custom TaqMan&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; SNP Genotyping Assays. Genotypic, allelic and haplotypic frequencies were calculated based on individual animal genotypes. Chi-square tests were used to examine Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium state and compare genotypic distribution across breeds. Genetic distances among the three breeds, and between these and 30 breeds reared in other countries were estimated based on haplotypic frequencies using fixation index F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; with Arlequin v3.1 software; a Neighbor-Joining tree was created using PHYLIP package v3.695. Level of statistical significance was set at P = 0.01. All scrapie resistance-associated alleles (146S, 146D, 211Q and 222K) were detected in the studied population. Significant frequency differences were observed between the indigenous Greek and Damascus breeds. Alleles 222K and 146S had the highest frequency in the two indigenous and the Damascus breed, respectively (&lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 6.0%). The studied breeds shared similar haplotypic frequencies with most South Italian and Turkish breeds but differed significantly from North-Western European, Far East and some USA goat breeds. Results suggest there is adequate variation in the &lt;i&gt;PRNP&lt;/i&gt; gene locus to support breeding programs for enhanced scrapie resistance in goats reared in Greece. Genetic comparisons among goat breeds indicate that separate breeding programs should apply to the two indigenous and the imported Damascus breeds.</content></content><author><name>Sotiria Vouraki</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sotiria Vouraki, Athanasios I.

This contributes to the majority of the virus being present in the follicle and represents a barrier to virus control. Using mathematical models, we investigate these dynamics. Two models are analyzed. The first assumes that CTL can only become stimulated and expand in the extra-follicular compartment, with migration accounting for the presence of CTL in the follicle. In the second model, follicular CTL can also undergo antigen-induced expansion. Consistent with experi-mental data, both models predict increased virus compartmentalization in the presence of stronger CTL responses and lower virus loads, and a more pronounced rise of extra-follicular compared to follicular virus during CD8 cell depletion experiments. The mod-els, however, differ in other aspects. The follicular expansion model results in dynamics that promote the clearance of productive infection in the extrafollicular site, with any productively infected cells found being the result of immigration from the follicle. This is not observed in the model without follicular CTL expansion. The models further predict different consequences of introducing engineered, follicular-homing CTL, which has been proposed as a therapeutic means to improve virus control. Without follicular CTL expansion, this is predicted to result in a reduction of virus load in both compartments. The follicular CTL expansion model, however, makes the counter-intuitive prediction that addition of F-homing CTL not only results in a reduction of follicular virus load, but also in an increase in extrafollicular virus replication. These predictions remain to be ex-perimentally tested, which will be relevant for distinguishing between models and for understanding how therapeutic introduction of F-homing CTL might impact the overall dynamics of the infection.</content></content><published>1527145200000</published><description>Data from SIV-infected macaques indicate that virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are mostly present in the extrafollicular (EF) compartment of the lymphoid tissue, with reduced homing to the follicular (F) site.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Scaphoid non-union is a challenging and complex problem. Various methods have been proposed for the management of patients with scaphoid non-union and to reduce the risk of complications. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the clinical and functional outcomes of using a vascularized bone graft in the treatment of scaphoid non-union.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients with scaphoid non-union who underwent 1,2 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery pedicled vascularized bone graft between January 2005 and January 2011 were enrolled. The parameters assessed included clinical and functional outcomes, radiological measures, and potential risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients were finally included. Thirty patients achieved union (73%) and 11 did not. Smoking was a significant risk factor for non-union after the surgery. In patients who achieved union, grip strength and radioulnar abduction were greater in comparison to that in patients who did not achieve union. Functional measures, including the Disabilities of Arm and Shoulder score and the Modified Mayo Wrist Score, improved in patients with scaphoid union. The scaphoid length also improved significantly postoperatively in these patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Surgical treatment of scaphoid non-union using vascularized bone graft led to a high union rate with good clinical and functional outcomes.

Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. It can alleviate the damage of heavy metal ions, and other chemical substances, changes in temperature and humidity, oxidative stress in higher plants, and enhance resistance of plants to abiotic stress. The transformation of N-Acetyl-5-hydroxy tryptamin into melatonin requires the involvement of methyltransferase. In this study, a methyltransferase gene &lt;i&gt;ZjOMT&lt;/i&gt; has been cloned from &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. The gene was induced by aluminum (Al) stress in the leaves and roots of &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;, and was up-regulated by 20.86- and 31.18-folds, respectively. The expression of ZjOMT in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increased the content of melatonin by about 8-fold in the recombinant strain compared with that of the empty vector strain. Al resistance test showed that the resistance of recombinant strain BL21-pET32-ZjOMT to Al was significantly higher than that of the empty vector strain BL21-pET32. The survival rate of the recombinant strain expressing ZjOMT was about 100-fold higher than that of the empty vector strain when treated with 0.35 mM Al. These findings suggest that the heterologous expression of ZjOMT improved the resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to Al by increasing the content of melatonin.</content></content><author><name>Hongsong Luo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongsong Luo, Chunyan He, Liebao Han&lt;/p&gt;

Glucose and palmitate synergistically stimulate insulin secretion, but chronically elevated they induce apoptotic β-cell death. The glucotoxic effect has been attributed, at least partly, to the upregulation of the oxidative stress marker thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). Palmitate downregulates TXNIP expression, the functional significance of which is still under debate. This study examines the mechanism and consequence of palmitate-mediated TXNIP regulation in insulin secreting cells. Palmitate (600 μM) reduced TXNIP mRNA levels in isolated human and mouse islets independently of FFAR1/GPR40. Similar effects of palmitate were observed in INS-1E cells and mimicked by other long chain fatty acids. The lowering of TXNIP mRNA was significant already 1 h after addition of palmitate, persisted for 24 h and was directly translated to changes in TXNIP protein. The pharmacological inhibition of palmitate-induced phosphorylation of AMPK, ERK1/2, JNK and PKCα/β by BML-275, PD98059, SP600125 and Gö6976, respectively, did not abolish palmitate-mediated TXNIP downregulation. The effect of palmitate was superimposed by a time-dependent (8 h and 24 h) decline of TXNIP mRNA and protein. This decline correlated with accumulation of secreted insulin into the medium. Accordingly, exogenously added insulin reduced TXNIP mRNA and protein levels, an effect counteracted by the insulin/IGF-1 receptor antagonist linsitinib. The inhibition of PI3K and Akt/PKB increased TXNIP mRNA levels. The histone deacetylase (HDAC1/2/3) inhibitor MS-275 completely abrogated the time-dependent, insulin-mediated reduction of TXNIP, leaving the effect of palmitate unaltered. Acute stimulation of insulin secretion and chronic accentuation of cell death by palmitate occurred independently of TXNIP regulation. On the contrary, palmitate antagonized glucose-augmented ROS production. In conclusion, glucose-induced TXNIP expression is efficiently antagonized by two independent mechanisms, namely via an autocrine activation of insulin/IGF-1 receptors involving HDAC and by palmitate attenuating oxidative stress of β-cells.</content></content><author><name>Madhura Panse</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Madhura Panse, Oliver Kluth, Estela Lorza-Gil, Gabriele Kaiser, Eckhard Mühlbauer, Annette Schürmann, Hans-Ulrich Häring, Susanne Ullrich, Felicia Gerst&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, two-photon calcium imaging has become a standard tool to probe the function of neural circuits and to study computations in neuronal populations. However, the acquired signal is only an indirect measurement of neural activity due to the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium indicators. Different algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium measurements have been proposed in the past, but it is an open question how far performance can be improved. Here, we report the results of the &lt;i&gt;spikefinder&lt;/i&gt; challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike rate inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity. The competition shows that benchmark challenges can drive algorithmic developments in neuroscience.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a1WS4uygAIc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526935325513</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Berens, Jeremy Freeman, Thomas Deneux, Nicolay Chenkov, Thomas McColgan, Artur Speiser, Jakob H.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is modeled to explore the mechanisms of this effective, but poorly understood, treatment for motor symptoms of drug-refractory Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. First, a neural field model of the corticothalamic-basal ganglia (CTBG) system is developed that reproduces key clinical features of Parkinson’s disease, including its characteristic 4–8 Hz and 13–30 Hz electrophysiological signatures. Deep brain stimulation of the STN is then modeled and shown to suppress the pathological 13–30 Hz (beta) activity for physiologically realistic and optimized stimulus parameters. This supports the idea that suppression of abnormally coherent activity in the CTBG system is a major factor in DBS therapy for Parkinson’s disease, by permitting normal dynamics to resume. At high stimulus intensities, nonlinear effects in the target population mediate wave-wave interactions between resonant beta activity and the stimulus pulse train, leading to complex spectral structure that shows remarkable similarity to that seen in steady-state evoked potential experiments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nyh-p6NdIb8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527626526848</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eli J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Calcifications within the hippocampus were recently described for the first time on computed tomography (CT). These calcifications appeared in patients older than 50 years, the prevalence increases with age and they may be associated with cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the histological basis (the presence, severity and location) of these CT-detected hippocampal calcifications of post-mortem brains.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;CT scans of seven post-mortem brains were scored for the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of hippocampal calcification. After this, samples from nine hippocampi (bilateral in two brains, unilateral in five brains) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to indicate the cytoarchitecture, with Elastica van Gieson to analyse the elastic connective tissue of the vessel walls and with von Kossa for detection of calcium.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In four brains (six hippocampi), calcifications were both found on CT and in corresponding histology. In three brains (three hippocampi), calcifications were absent on CT and corresponding histology. In histology, mild calcifications were located in the tail and severe calcifications involved the tail, body and sometimes the head of the hippocampus. The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Melissa E.

The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microenvironment of bacterial pathogens is often characterized by nutrient limitation. Consequently, conventional rich &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture conditions used widely to evaluate antibacterial agents are often poorly predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity, especially for agents targeting metabolic pathways. In one such pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is essential for production of isoprenoids in bacterial pathogens, relatively little is known about the influence of growth environment on antibacterial properties of inhibitors targeting enzymes in this pathway. The early steps of the MEP pathway are catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase and reductoisomerase (IspC). The in vitro antibacterial efficacy of the DXP synthase inhibitor butylacetylphosphonate (BAP) was recently reported to be strongly dependent upon growth medium, with high potency observed under nutrient limitation and exceedingly weak activity in nutrient-rich conditions. In contrast, the well-known IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has potent antibacterial activity in nutrient-rich conditions, but to date, its efficacy had not been explored under more relevant nutrient-limited conditions. The goal of this work was to thoroughly characterize the effects of BAP and fosmidomycin on bacterial cells under varied growth conditions. In this work, we show that activities of both inhibitors, alone and in combination, are strongly dependent upon growth medium, with differences in cellular uptake contributing to variance in potency of both agents. Fosmidomycin is dissimilar to BAP in that it displays relatively weaker activity in nutrient-limited compared to nutrient-rich conditions. Interestingly, while it has been generally accepted that fosmidomycin activity depends upon expression of the GlpT transporter, our results indicate for the first time that fosmidomycin can enter cells by an alternative mechanism under nutrient limitation. Finally, we show that the potency and relationship of the BAP-fosmidomycin combination also depends upon the growth medium, revealing a striking loss of BAP-fosmidomycin synergy under nutrient limitation. This change in BAP-fosmidomycin relationship suggests a shift in the metabolic and/or regulatory networks surrounding DXP accompanying the change in growth medium, the understanding of which could significantly impact targeting strategies against this pathway. More generally, our findings emphasize the importance of considering physiologically relevant growth conditions for predicting the antibacterial potential MEP pathway inhibitors and for studies of their intracellular targets.</content></content><author><name>Sara Sanders</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Sanders, David Bartee, Mackenzie J.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional therapies, several new strategies have been proposed for modulating autoimmune diseases, including the adoptive transfer of immunological cells. In this context, dendritic cells (DCs) appear to be one of the most promising treatments for autoimmune disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of adoptive transfer of DCs obtained from both naïve and ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice on the severity of TNBS induced colitis and analyze the eventual protective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;To induce oral tolerance, BALB/c mice were fed 4mg/mL OVA solution for seven consecutive days. Spleen DCs were isolated from tolerant (tDC) and naïve (nDC) mice, and then adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Three days later, colitis was induced in DC treated mice by intrarectal instillation of 100μg2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol. Control subjects received only intrarectal instillation of either TNBS solution or a vehicle. Five days later, mice from all groups were euthanized and examined for physiological and immunological parameters. Regarding the phenotype, we observed that the frequencies of CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHC II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly lower in DCs isolated from tolerant mice than in those from naive mice. However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Lisiery N.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of xenobiotic mixtures containing persistent organic pollutants isolated from commercial fish oil samples against sex hormone receptors, including estrogen and androgen. The applied bioassay was based on transgenic yeast strains. The mixtures were extracted from the samples using the semi-permeable membrane dialysis technique and analyzed with gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. It turned out that mixtures of chemicals isolated from fish oil may interact with human steroid sex hormone receptors in various ways: the tested samples showed both estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Calculated 17β-estradiol equivalents for the tested samples ranged between 0.003 and 0.073 pg g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat). Anti-androgenic activity expressed as the flutamide equivalent concentration was in the 18.58–216.21 ng g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat) range. Polychlorinated biphenyls and various DDT metabolites were the main fish oil pollutants influencing the receptors. Additivity and/or synergy between chemicals was observed in the ER/AR mediated response.</content></content><author><name>Marek Łukasz Roszko</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marek Łukasz Roszko, Marta Kamińska, Krystyna Szymczyk, Katarzyna Piasecka-Jóźwiak, Beata Chabłowska&lt;/p&gt;

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</content></content><author><name>Eli Skeie</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eli Skeie, Anne Mette Koch, Stig Harthug, Unni Fosse, Kari Sygnestveit, Roy Miodini Nilsen, Randi J.

Production of higher-fidelity digital elevation models is important; as such models are indispensable components of space data infrastructure. However, loss of terrain features is a constant problem for grid digital elevation models, although these models have already been defined in such a way that their distinct usage as data sources in terrain modeling processing is prohibited. Therefore, in this study, the novel concept-terrain semanteme is proposed to define local space terrain features, and a new process for generating grid digital elevation models based on this new concept is designed. A prototype system is programmed to test the proposed approach; the results indicate that terrain semanteme can be applied in the process of grid digital elevation model generation, and that usage of this new concept improves the digital elevation model fidelity. Moreover, the terrain semanteme technique can be applied for recovery of distorted digital elevation model regions containing terrain semantemes, with good recovery efficiency indicated by experiments.</content></content><author><name>Bo Zhou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Zhou, Junbo Xu, Xuedong Zhang, Xuejun Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eh0FCzbR2R4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526676128418</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Espinosa-Soto&lt;/p&gt;

The Na/K-ATPase is an important membrane ion transporter and a signaling receptor that is essential for maintaining normal cell function. The current study examined the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulating miR-29b-3p, an anti-fibrotic microRNA, in a mouse chronic kidney disease (CKD) model (5/6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; partial nephrectomy or PNx). The results showed that CKD induced significant reduction of miR-29b-3p expression in the heart tissue by activation of Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. To demonstrate the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling, we also performed the PNx surgery on Na/K-ATPase α1 heterozygous (α1+/-) mice, which expresses ~40% less Na/K-ATPase α1 compared to their wild type littermates (WT) and exhibits deficiency in Na/K-ATPase signaling. We found that CKD did not significantly change the miR-29b-3p expression in heart tissue from the α1+/- animals. We also found that CKD failed to activate Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. Using isolated cardiac fibroblasts from α1+/- mice and their WT littermates, we showed that ouabain, a specific Na/K-ATPase ligand, induces decreased miR-29b-3p expression in fibroblasts isolated from WT mice, but had no effect in cells from α1+/- mice. Inhibition of NFκB by Bay11-7082 prevented ouabain-induced miR-29b-3p reduction in WT fibroblasts. To further confirm the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effect of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulation of miR-29b-3p and cardiac fibrosis in CKD animals, we used pNaKtide, a Src inhibiting peptide derived from the sequence of Na/K-ATPase, to block the activation of Na/K-ATPase signaling. The result showed that pNaKtide injection significantly increased miR-29b-3p expression and mitigated the CKD-induced cardiac fibrosis in these animals. These results clearly demonstrated that Na/K-ATPase signaling is an important mediator in CKD that regulates miR-29b-3p expression and cardiac fibrosis, which provides a novel target for regulation of miR-29b-3p in CKD. We also demonstrate that antagonizing Na/K-ATPase signaling by pNaKtide can reduce organ fibrosis through the stimulation of tissue miR-29b-3p expression.</content></content><author><name>Christopher A.

We also demonstrate that antagonizing Na/K-ATPase signaling by pNaKtide can reduce organ fibrosis through the stimulation of tissue miR-29b-3p expression.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197688</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7227:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Mingnan Qu</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>511</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26283-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26283_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO2</title><fingerprint>4e5f4cec</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26283-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vtjk1tSyyDE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1526626800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 18 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26283-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26283-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Systematic biology analysis on photosynthetic carbon metabolism of maize leaf following sudden heat shock under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vtjk1tSyyDE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/vtjk1tSyyDE/s41598-018-26283-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526635169773</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163728c07ed:5098e7a:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332833v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Chen, X.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/28/332833</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332833v1?rss=1</link><title>ERVcaller: Identifying and genotyping non-reference unfixed endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and other transposable elements (TEs) using next-generation sequencing data [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>1cddec07</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>More than 8% of the human genome is derived from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b00931&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, you can do hydrogenation reactions in a stainless-steel ball mill, without any sort of noble-metal catalyst. The hydrogen is produced when you add some n-alkane or diethyl ether to the mix (these actually get converted to gaseous methane and hydrogen under the milling conditions). Some pretty severe reductions are realized, for example, taking biphenyl all the way down to 1-cyclohexylcyclohexane. Olefins go to alkanes under these conditions, of course, and ketones and alcohols tend to just get erased: it’s a bulldozer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although it’s surprising, this reaction isn’t quite as much voodoo as it might appear. Well, not more than any other hydrogenation, anyway. The ball mill is, of course, a sealed vessel, and the authors show that the lower-boiling additives seem to be more effective, presumably because they increase the internal pressure. And it’s not like there’s no catalyst present, because you have the stainless steel. If you use zirconium oxide balls instead of the steel alloy ones, for example, you get no hydrogenation at all. Adding bits of different metals back in showed that the chromium is what’s producing the hydrogen from the alkanes or ether, while the nickel is acting as the hydrogenation catalyst itself. The stainless-steel alloy itself (304 steel) was the most effective combination, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balls do get eroded a bit under the conditions, so what you’ve got is finely divided metals, under some heat from the mechanical energy of the milling, and under hydrogen pressure from the decomposition of the co-reactants. No wonder things get reduced! But it’s not a reaction that you would have predicted up front. And even if you’d stipulated that hydrogenation would start under these conditions, I don’t think you would have guessed how powerful it would be. The last time I hydrogenated down a whole aryl system (it’s been a while), I was running at something like 1600 psi (110 bar) at 120C with a rhodium catalyst, and the stuff came out looking – and smelling – like old lawnmower oil. This reaction probably doesn’t get above 60 degrees, by contrast. Admittedly, there’s no word in the paper about the appearance or aroma of the crude products, but I’m willing to bet that that part remains the same. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1525866196000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here’s one to add to the “weird mechanosynthesis” pile.

Background &lt;p&gt;Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can produce false positive (FP) results in patients with human African trypanosomiasis and rheumatoid factor (RF), but specificity against other infectious agents and immunological factors is largely unknown. Low diagnostic specificity caused by cross-reactivity may lead to over-estimates of the number of malaria cases and over-use of antimalarial drugs, at the cost of not diagnosing and treating the true underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing Programme was analysed to assess FP rates of 221 RDTs against four infectious agents (Chagas, dengue, Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis) and four immunological factors (anti-nuclear antibody, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), RF and rapid plasma regain). Only RDTs with a FP rate against clean negative samples less than 10% were included. Paired t-tests were used to compare product-specific FP rates on clean negative samples and samples containing non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty (18%) RDTs showed no FP results against any tested infectious agent or immunological factor. In the remaining RDTs significant and clinically relevant increases in FP rates were observed for samples containing HAMA and RF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were significant correlations between product-matched FP rates for RF and HAMA on all RDT test bands (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and FP rates for each infectious agent and immunological factor were also correlated between test bands of combination RDTs (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;≤0.002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;False positive results against non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors does not appear to be a universal property of malaria RDTs.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking. Stride-to-stride variability of temporal gait parameters was also estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Walking speed, cadence or stride length were not different between PD and HS during linear walking. Speed, cadence and stride length diminished during curved walking in both groups, stride length more in PD than HS. In PD compared to HS, the stride length-cadence relationship was altered during curved walking.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking. Stride-to-stride variability of temporal gait parameters was also estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Walking speed, cadence or stride length were not different between PD and HS during linear walking. Speed, cadence and stride length diminished during curved walking in both groups, stride length more in PD than HS. In PD compared to HS, the stride length-cadence relationship was altered during curved walking. Duration of the double-support phase was also increased during curved walking, as was variability of the single support, swing phase and double support phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The spatio-temporal gait pattern and variability are significantly modified in well-treated, high-functioning patients with PD walking along circular trajectories, even when they exhibit no changes in speed in straight-line walking. The increased variability of the gait phases during curved walking is an identifying characteristic of PD. We discuss our findings in term of interplay between control of balance and of locomotor progression: the former is challenged by curved trajectories even in high-functioning patients, while the latter may not be critically affected.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197264</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7d:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024927?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Fei Li</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024927?af=R</link><title>Reaction time for trimolecular reactions in compartment-based reaction-diffusion models</title><fingerprint>b057daee</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1527140105000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024927?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527492817805</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163a5aab38d:1587658:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00218</originId><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><published>1527652800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00218</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00218</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Targeting of EGFR, VEGFR2, and Akt by Engineered Dual Drug Encapsulated Mesoporous Silica–Gold Nanoclusters Sensitizes Tamoxifen-Resistant Breast Cancer</title><fingerprint>fac22ea5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00218/20180530/images/medium/mp-2018-002185_0012.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00218&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Deviance sensitivity is the specific response to a surprising stimulus, one that violates expectations set by the past stimulation stream. In audition, deviance sensitivity is often conflated with stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA), the decrease in responses to a common stimulus that only partially generalizes to other, rare stimuli. SSA is usually measured using oddball sequences, where a common (standard) tone and a rare (deviant) tone are randomly intermixed. However, the larger responses to a tone when deviant does not necessarily represent deviance sensitivity. Deviance sensitivity is commonly tested using a control sequence in which many different tones serve as the standard, eliminating the expectations set by the standard (&apos;deviant among many standards&apos;). When the response to a tone when deviant (against a single standard) is larger than the responses to the same tone in the control sequence, it is concluded that true deviance sensitivity occurs. In primary auditory cortex of anesthetized rats, responses to deviants and to the same tones in the control condition are comparable in size. We recorded local field potentials and multiunit activity from the auditory cortex of awake, freely moving rats, implanted with 32-channel drivable microelectrode arrays and using telemetry. We observed highly significant SSA in the awake state. Moreover, the responses to a tone when deviant were significantly larger than the responses to the same tone in the control condition. These results establish the presence of true deviance sensitivity in primary auditory cortex in awake rats.</content></content><author><name>Ana Polterovich</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Polterovich, Maciej M.

However existing accounts fail to clarify: (i) how proposed theories differ in accounts of ASD vs. schizophrenia and (ii) whether the impairments result from weaker priors or enhanced likelihoods. Here, we directly address these issues by characterizing how 91 healthy participants, scored for autistic and schizotypal traits, implicitly learned and combined priors with sensory information. This was accomplished through a visual statistical learning paradigm designed to quantitatively assess variations in individuals’ likelihoods and priors. The acquisition of the priors was found to be intact along both traits spectra. However, autistic traits were associated with more veridical perception and weaker influence of expectations. Bayesian modeling revealed that this was due, not to weaker prior expectations, but to more precise sensory representations.</description><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1635e7cb971:2ff2dae:2835af05</id><published>1526256000000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Recent theories propose that schizophrenia/schizotypy and autistic spectrum disorder are related to impairments in Bayesian inference that is, how the brain integrates sensory information (likelihoods) with prior knowledge.

Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</content></content><author><name>Lari Lehtovirta</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lari Lehtovirta, Aleksi Reito, Jyrki Parkkinen, Sirpa Peräniemi, Jouko Vepsäläinen, Antti Eskelinen&lt;/p&gt;

Conclusions: MXP implements a number of novel features which, from our point of view, make it to be more suitable and more convenient for building bioinformatics pipelines.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329110v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527097201997</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1638e16154d:7799c33:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26773-y</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Boxue Du</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>294</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26773-y/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26773_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26773-y</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26773-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Understanding Trap Effects on Electrical Treeing Phenomena in EPDM/POSS Composites</title><fingerprint>57758bb9</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understanding Trap Effects on Electrical Treeing Phenomena in EPDM/POSS Composites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding Trap Effects on Electrical Treeing Phenomena in EPDM/POSS Composites, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26773-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26773-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Understanding Trap Effects on Electrical Treeing Phenomena in EPDM/POSS Composites&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/L6fTzUqj-7s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1527750000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understanding Trap Effects on Electrical Treeing Phenomena in EPDM/POSS Composites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding Trap Effects on Electrical Treeing Phenomena in EPDM/POSS Composites, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26773-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26773-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Understanding Trap Effects on Electrical Treeing Phenomena in EPDM/POSS Composites&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/L6fTzUqj-7s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/L6fTzUqj-7s/s41598-018-26773-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527757899736</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163b57787d8:2ea773f:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329805v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Hu, A.

Background &lt;p&gt;No evidence-based therapy exists for non-arteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO). Retinal ischemic tolerance is low; irreversible damage occurs within four hours of experimental NA-CRAO. In previous randomized trials evaluating intra-arterial or intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in NA-CRAO, only one patient was treated this early. In December 2013, the Departments of Neurology &amp;amp; Stroke and Ophthalmology at University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany, decided to treat patients using IVT within 4.5 hours of NA-CRAO, the therapeutic window established for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive NA-CRAO patients with severe visual loss received IVT after exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up was conducted at day 5 (d5) and day 30 (d30). Visual outcomes were compared to the conservative standard treatment (CST) arm of the EAGLE-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Until August 2016, 20 patients received IVT within 4.5 hours after NA-CRAO with a median onset-to-treatment time of 210 minutes (IQR 120–240). Visual acuity improved from baseline mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 2.46±0.33 (SD) (light perception) to 1.52±1.09 (Snellen equivalent: 6/200) at d5 (p = 0.002) and 1.60±1.08 (Snellen equivalent: 6/240) at d30. Compared to the EAGLE CST-arm, functional recovery to reading ability occurred more frequently after IVT: 6/20 (30%) versus 1/39 (3%) at d5 (p = 0.005) and at d30 5/20 (25%) versus 2/37 (5%) (p = 0.045). Two patients experienced serious adverse events (one angioedema and one bleeding from an abdominal aortic aneurysm) but recovered without sequelae.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IVT within 4.5 hours after symptom onset may represent an effective treatment of NA-CRAO.

Using cultivar resistance against pathogens is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly methods for control of crop diseases. However, cultivar resistance can be easily rendered ineffective due to changes in pathogen populations or environments. To test the hypothesis that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistance and quantitative resistance (QR) in one cultivar can provide more effective resistance than use of either type of resistance on its own, effectiveness of resistance in eight oilseed rape (&lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&lt;/i&gt;) cultivars with different &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR against &lt;i&gt;Leptosphaeria maculans&lt;/i&gt; (phoma stem canker) was investigated in 13 different environments/sites over three growing seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013). Cultivar Drakkar with no &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and no QR was used as susceptible control and for sampling &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations. Isolates of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from the 13 sites in 2010/2011 to assess frequencies of avirulent alleles of different effector genes (&lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt;) corresponding to the resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;) used in the field experiments. Results of field experiments showed that cultivars DK Cabernet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; + QR) and Adriana (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had significantly less severe phoma stem canker than cultivars Capitol (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;) and Bilbao (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt;), respectively. Results of controlled environment experiments confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR in these four cultivars. Analysis of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations from different sites showed that the mean frequencies of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt; (10%) and &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; (41%) were less than that of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt; (100%), suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistances were partially rendered ineffective while &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; resistance was still effective. Cultivar Excel (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had less severe canker than cultivar Roxet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;), but the difference between them was not significant due to influence of the effective resistance gene &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;. For the two cultivars with only QR, Es-Astrid (QR) had less severe stem canker than NK Grandia (QR). Analysis of the relationship between severity of stem canker and weather data among the 13 sites in the three growing seasons showed that increased severity of stem canker was associated with increased rainfall during the phoma leaf spot development stage and increased temperature during the stem canker development stage. Further analysis of cultivar response to environmental factors showed that cultivars with both an &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR (e.g. DK Cabernet, Adriana and Excel) were less sensitive to a change in environment than cultivars with only &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes (e.g. Capitol, Bilbao) or only QR (e.g. DK Grandia). These results suggest that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR can provide effective, stable control of phoma stem canker in different environments.</content></content><author><name>Yong-Ju Huang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yong-Ju Huang, Georgia K.

Isolates of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from the 13 sites in 2010/2011 to assess frequencies of avirulent alleles of different effector genes (&lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt;) corresponding to the resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;) used in the field experiments. Results of field experiments showed that cultivars DK Cabernet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; + QR) and Adriana (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had significantly less severe phoma stem canker than cultivars Capitol (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;) and Bilbao (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt;), respectively. Results of controlled environment experiments confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR in these four cultivars. Analysis of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations from different sites showed that the mean frequencies of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt; (10%) and &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; (41%) were less than that of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt; (100%), suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistances were partially rendered ineffective while &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; resistance was still effective. Cultivar Excel (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had less severe canker than cultivar Roxet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;), but the difference between them was not significant due to influence of the effective resistance gene &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;. For the two cultivars with only QR, Es-Astrid (QR) had less severe stem canker than NK Grandia (QR). Analysis of the relationship between severity of stem canker and weather data among the 13 sites in the three growing seasons showed that increased severity of stem canker was associated with increased rainfall during the phoma leaf spot development stage and increased temperature during the stem canker development stage. Further analysis of cultivar response to environmental factors showed that cultivars with both an &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR (e.g. DK Cabernet, Adriana and Excel) were less sensitive to a change in environment than cultivars with only &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes (e.g. Capitol, Bilbao) or only QR (e.g. DK Grandia). These results suggest that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR can provide effective, stable control of phoma stem canker in different environments.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197752</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2335:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37018</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527552000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37018</canonicalUrl><engagement>6</engagement><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37018</link><title>The ER membrane protein complex interacts cotranslationally to enable biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins</title><fingerprint>fd235e90</fingerprint><description>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) supports biosynthesis of proteins with diverse transmembrane domain (TMD) lengths and hydrophobicity.

WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence. This peptide exhibits micromolar affinity towards WHSC1 in biochemical and biophysical assays. Furthermore, a crystal structure was solved with the peptide in complex with SAM and the SET domain of WHSC1L1. This inhibitor is an important first step in creating potent, selective WHSC1 tool compounds for the purposes of understanding the complex biology in relation to human disease.</content></content><author><name>Michael J.

Compounds of this novel class hold promise for the prevention of restenosis, cancer cell metastasis, and other proliferative disorders.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Design_and_Evaluation_of_Heterobivalent_PAR1_PAR2_Ligands_as_Antagonists_of_Calcium_Mobilization/6394430</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528151444818</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163ccec8d52:5058549:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197834</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1526936400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1526936400000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197834</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197834</link><title>Changes in the vibration sensitivity and pressure pain thresholds in patients with burning mouth syndrome</title><fingerprint>c821649</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Brenda de Souza Moura, Natália dos Reis Ferreira, Marcos F.

Background &lt;p&gt;Increased hepatic insulin clearance (HIC) is important in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study is to analyze an effective insulin resistance (IR) index that is minimally affected by HIC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Our study involved 20 participants with T2DM and 21 healthy participants without diabetes (Non-DM). Participants underwent a meal tolerance test from which plasma glucose, insulin and serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) were measured, and HOMA-IR and HIC were calculated. Participants then underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp from which the glucose disposal rate (GDR) was measured.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The index CPR-IR = 20/(fasting CPR × fasting plasma glucose) was correlated more strongly with GDR, than was HOMA-IR, and CPR-IR could be used to estimate GDR.

In Non-DM, CPR-IR and HOMA-IR were equally well correlated with GDR regardless of HIC. The mean HIC value in T2DM was significantly higher than that of Non-DM.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CPR-IR could be a simple and effective index of insulin resistance for patients with type 2 diabetes that is minimally affected by HIC.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Tsuyoshi Okura</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsuyoshi Okura, Risa Nakamura, Yohei Fujioka, Sonoko Kawamoto-Kitao, Yuichi Ito, Kazuhisa Matsumoto, Kyoko Shoji, Keisuke Sumi, Kazuhiko Matsuzawa, Shoichiro Izawa, Etsuko Ueta, Masahiko Kato, Takeshi Imamura, Shin-ichi Taniguchi, Kazuhiro Yamamoto&lt;/p&gt;

The ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 degrade extracellular ATP to adenosine. ATP is released by stressed or damaged cells and provides pro-inflammatory signals to immune cells through P2 receptors. Adenosine, on the other hand, suppresses immune cells by stimulating P1 receptors. Thus, CD39 and CD73 can shape the quality of immune responses. Here we demonstrate that upregulation of CD39 is a consistent feature of activated conventional CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Following stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from human blood gained surface expression of CD39 but displayed only low levels of CD73. Activated human T cells from inflamed joints largely presented with a CD39&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD73&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. In line, in spleens of mice with acute &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, listeria-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells acquired a CD39&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD73&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are one of the important factors in controlling gene expression and elucidation of their roles has been attracting great interest. We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</content></content><author><name>Ryo Komura</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Komura, Wataru Aoki, Keisuke Motone, Atsushi Satomura, Mitsuyoshi Ueda&lt;/p&gt;

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that quantifies the magnetic susceptibility distribution within biological tissues. QSM calculates the underlying magnetic susceptibility by deconvolving the tissue magnetic field map with a unit dipole kernel. However, this deconvolution problem is ill-posed. The morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) introduces total variation (TV) to regularize the susceptibility reconstruction. However, MEDI results still contain artifacts near tissue boundaries because MEDI only imposes TV constraint on voxels inside smooth regions. We introduce a Morphology-Adaptive TV (MATV) for improving TV-regularized QSM. The MATV method first classifies imaging target into smooth and nonsmooth regions by thresholding magnitude gradients. In the dipole inversion for QSM, the TV regularization weights are a monotonically decreasing function of magnitude gradients. Thus, voxels inside smooth regions are assigned with larger weights than those in nonsmooth regions. Using phantom and in vivo datasets, we compared the performance of MATV with that of MEDI. MATV results had better visual quality than MEDI results, especially near tissue boundaries. Preliminary brain imaging results illustrated that MATV has potential to improve the reconstruction of regions near tissue boundaries.</content></content><author><name>Li Guo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Li Guo, Yingjie Mei, Jijing Guan, Xiangliang Tan, Yikai Xu, Wufan Chen, Qianjin Feng, Yanqiu Feng&lt;/p&gt;

Spatial capture-recapture modelling (SCR) is a powerful analytical tool to estimate density and derive information on space use and behaviour of elusive animals. Yet, SCR has been seldom applied to the study of ecologically keystone small mammals. Here we highlight its potential and requirements with a case study on common voles (&lt;i&gt;Microtus arvalis&lt;/i&gt;). First, we address mortality associated with live-trapping, which can be high in small mammals, and must be kept minimal. We designed and tested a nest box coupled with a classic Sherman trap and show that it allows a 5-fold reduction of mortality in traps. Second, we address the need to adjust the trapping grid to the individual home range to maximize spatial recaptures. In May-June 2016, we captured and tagged with transponders 227 voles in a 1.2-ha area during two monthly sessions. Using a Bayesian SCR with a multinomial approach, we estimated: (1) the baseline detection rate and investigated variation according to sex, time or behaviour (aversion/attraction after a previous capture); (2) the parameter sigma that describes how detection probability declines as a function of the distance to an individual´s activity centre, and investigated variation according to sex; and (3) density and population sex-ratio. We show that reducing the maximum distance between traps from 12 to 9.6m doubled spatial recaptures and improved model predictions. Baseline detection rate increased over time (after overcoming a likely aversion to entering new odourless traps) and was greater for females than males in June. The sigma parameter of males was twice that of females, indicating larger home ranges. Density estimates were of 142.92±38.50 and 168.25±15.79 voles/ha in May and June, respectively, with 2–3 times more females than males. We highlight the potential and broad applicability that SCR offers and provide specific recommendations for using it to study small mammals like voles.</content></content><author><name>Juan Romairone</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Romairone, José Jiménez, Juan José Luque-Larena, François Mougeot&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adults. People with OSAS have a higher risk of experiencing traffic accidents and occupational injuries (OIs). We aimed to clarify the diagnostic performance of a three-channel screening device (ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with the gold standard of full-night attended polysomnography (PSG) among hospital outpatients not referred for sleep-related symptoms. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether manual revision of the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore enhanced diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We investigated 68 patients with OI and 44 without OI recruited from the University Hospital Basel emergency room, using a cross-sectional study design. Participating patients spent one night at home with ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and within 2 weeks slept for one night at the sleep laboratory.

Background &lt;p&gt;Risky sexual behaviors adversely affect the health of youth and young adults exposing them to sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS and unwanted pregnancy to females that in turn lead to deleterious health, social and economic consequences. Youth centers inform their clients on sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancy, high risk abortion, and other reproductive health problems. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the prevalence of risky sexual behaviors among youth center reproductive health clinic users and non-users in Addis Ababa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A comparative cross-sectional study design was carried out among 524 youth in Addis Ababa from March to April, 2016. The data was entered in EPI-INFO 7 software; and cleaned and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. The prevalence was computed. Binary and multivariable logistic regression was done to determine the strength, direction and significance of association between youth center reproductive health clinic utilization and risky sexual behavior and to control confounder variables respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 524 youth with the response rate of 92% participated in the study. The overall prevalence of risky sexual behavior was 226 (43.1%) (With statistically significant difference in prevalence among users 101 (38.5%) and non-users 125 (47.7%) of youth center clinics, (p-value = 0.04). The odds of reporting risky sexual behavior was 60% higher among volunteers who did not use the reproductive health clinic, relative to those who did (AOR = 1.60; 95%CI = 1.08, 2.37). Teenagers aged 15–19 years were (AOR = 0.08; 95%CI = 0.05, 0.15) 92% less likely to practice risky sexual behavior compared to those aged 25–29 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Risky sexual behavior was statistically significantly higher among non-users of the youth center reproductive health clinic compared with the users. In addition, a substantial proportion of the youth engaged in different risky sexual behaviors that are evidenced by the existence of multiple sexual partners, sexual practice without condom and early sexual debut that might predispose youth to STIs including HIV infection and unwanted pregnancy. The ministry of health and its partners should strengthen youth center reproductive health clinics in urban, semi-urban and rural parts of Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nigusie Fetene</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nigusie Fetene, Wubegzier Mekonnen&lt;/p&gt;

Benthic algae fuel summer food webs in many sunlit rivers, and are hotspots for primary and secondary production and biogeochemical cycling. Concerningly, riverine benthic algal assemblages can become dominated by toxic cyanobacteria, threatening water quality and public health. In the Eel River in Northern California, over a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin poisonings since 2000. During the summers of 2013–2015, we documented spatial and temporal patterns of cyanotoxin concentrations in the watershed, showing widespread distribution of anatoxin-a in benthic cyanobacterial mats. Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed weekly to record dissolved microcystin and anatoxin-a levels at 10 sites throughout the watershed, and 187 &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt;-dominated or &lt;i&gt;Phormidium-&lt;/i&gt;dominated cyanobacterial mat samples were collected from 27 locations to measure intracellular anatoxin-a (ATX) and microcystins (MCY). Anatoxin-a levels were higher than microcystin for both SPATT (mean MCY = 0.8 and ATX = 4.8 ng g resin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and cyanobacterial mat samples (mean MCY = 0.074 and ATX = 1.89 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). Of the benthic mats sampled, 58.9% had detectable anatoxin-a (max = 70.93 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), while 37.6% had detectable microcystins (max = 2.29 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW).

Background &lt;p&gt;Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), particularly pathologic complete response (pCR), is an independent predictor of favorable clinical outcome in breast cancer (BC). The accuracy of residual disease measurement and reporting is of critical importance in treatment planning and prognosis for these patients. Currently, gross pathological evaluation of the residual tumor bed is the greatest determinant for accurate reporting of NACT response.

Free ICG (0.25 mg/kg) was injected intraoperatively. Tumor-to-background fluorescence ratio (TBFR) was calculated on ex vivo samples from the surgical specimen.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and seventy-two samples from nine breast surgical specimens were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity. Among them, 52 were malignant (30.2%) and 120 were benign (69.8%). The mean TBFR was 3.3 (SD 1.68) in malignant samples and 1.9 (SD 0.97) in benign samples (p = 0.0002). With a TBFR cut-off value of 1.3, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, false negative rate, and false positive rate of ICG-FI to predict residual tumoral disease in breast surgical samples post-NACT were 94.2%, 31.7%, 92.7%, 5.8%, and 68.3%, respectively. If we restricted our analysis to only patients who achieved pCR, the negative predictive value for ICG-FI was 100%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These first observations indicate that ex vivo ICG-FI is sensitive but not sufficiently specific to discriminate between benign breast tissue and malignant residual tissue.

Background &lt;p&gt;Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), particularly pathologic complete response (pCR), is an independent predictor of favorable clinical outcome in breast cancer (BC).

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutants have been associated with differences in clinical and virological characteristics. Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to alter this process to survive in host cells. In this work, we studied the modulation of autophagy by the replication of HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4, and the naturally occurring mutants BCP and preCore. HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induced accumulation of autophagosomes in hepatoma cells. However, no autophagic protein degradation was observed, indicating a blockage of autophagic flux at later stages. This inhibition of autophagy flux might be due to an impairment of lysosomal acidification in hepatoma cells. Moreover, HBV-mediated autophagy modulation was independent of the viral subgenotypes and enhanced in viruses with BCP and preCore naturally occurring mutations. These results contribute to understand the mechanisms by which different HBV variants contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infections. In addition, this study is the first to describe the role that two highly prevalent naturally occurring mutations exert on the modulation of HBV-induced autophagy.</content></content><author><name>María Mercedes Elizalde</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Mercedes Elizalde, Paula Soledad Pérez, Ina Sevic, Daniel Grasso, Alejandro Ropolo, Luciana Barbini, Rodolfo Héctor Campos, María Inés Vaccaro, Diego Martín Flichman&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation.However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false.Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings. However, in 2017, Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek subsequently published a paper, based upon the same data, that claimed to contradict the results of the earlier study. The former used unbinned likelihood methods, and the latter used binned methods, and comparison of distribution moments.Using these analyses, we also discuss how visualization of the data can aid in determination of the most appropriate statistical analysis methods to distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis. We also discuss the importance of assessment of the robustness of analysis results to methodological assumptions made (for example, arbitrary choices of number of bins and bin widths when using binned methods); an issue that is widely overlooked in the literature, but is critical to analysis reproducibility and robustness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When an analysis cannot distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis, care must be taken to ensure that the analysis methodology itself maximizes the use of information in the data that can distinguish between the two hypotheses.The use of binned methods by Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek (2017), that examined how many mass killings fell within a 14 day window from a previous mass killing, substantially reduced the sensitivity of their analysis to contagion effects.

&lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, as a model spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium, has been extensively used for spore germination research. Within this field, nutrient-dependent germination with specific germinant receptors (GerA, responding to L-alanine or L-valine; GerB and GerK, acting together to start spore germination process in response to AGFK) has been the most studied. There are three different variants of the GerAA subunit (299T/302S, 299A/302P, 299A/302S) of the GerA germination receptor present in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; subs. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; laboratory strains. According to our research, the 299A/302P one, unlike the others, interferes with the spore’s ability to germinate in L-alanine as assessed by the measurement of DPA release upon stimulation with the germinant. Multiple genetic manipulations described in this work followed by spore germination tests, together with secondary structure predictions led us to the following conclusions. First, position 302 of GerAA protein is crucial in terms of GerA germination receptor functionality; a proline residue at this position renders the GerA receptor non-functional, most probably due to a change in the protein secondary structure. Second, the 302P GerAA variant has most probably an impaired affinity to other components of GerA receptor. Together, these may explain the loss of GerA receptor’s function. Analysis of the GerAA protein should get us closer to understanding the mechanism of GerA receptor function.</content></content><author><name>Anna Grela</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Grela, Inga Jamrożek, Marta Hubisz, Adam Iwanicki, Krzysztof Hinc, Rajmund Kaźmierkiewicz, Michał Obuchowski&lt;/p&gt;

The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania infantum&lt;/i&gt; infection. In contrast, an antibody response against &lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-&lt;i&gt;Lu&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies. Dogs were classified into five groups based on serological and parasitological diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The following linear regression model was fitted: IgG level = mean + origin + sex + age + use of a repellent collar, and the residuals were assumed as pseudo-phenotypes for the association test between phenotypes and genotypes (GWA). A component of variance model that takes into account polygenic and sample structure effects (EMMAX) was employed for GWA. Phenotypic findings indicated that anti-SGH IgG levels remained higher in exposed and subclinically infected dogs than in severely diseased dogs even in regression model residuals. Five associated markers were identified on chromosomes 2, 20 and 31. The mapped genes included &lt;i&gt;CD180&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RP105&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MITF&lt;/i&gt; related to the rapid activation of B lymphocytes and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The findings pointed to chromosomal segments useful for functional confirmation studies and a search for adjuvant molecules of the anti-saliva response.</content></content><author><name>Luís F. S.

Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The following linear regression model was fitted: IgG level = mean + origin + sex + age + use of a repellent collar, and the residuals were assumed as pseudo-phenotypes for the association test between phenotypes and genotypes (GWA). A component of variance model that takes into account polygenic and sample structure effects (EMMAX) was employed for GWA. Phenotypic findings indicated that anti-SGH IgG levels remained higher in exposed and subclinically infected dogs than in severely diseased dogs even in regression model residuals. Five associated markers were identified on chromosomes 2, 20 and 31. The mapped genes included &lt;i&gt;CD180&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RP105&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MITF&lt;/i&gt; related to the rapid activation of B lymphocytes and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The findings pointed to chromosomal segments useful for functional confirmation studies and a search for adjuvant molecules of the anti-saliva response.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197215</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee9:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197846</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1527022800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527022800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197846</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197846</link><title>Evaluation of anaesthetic protocols for laboratory adult zebrafish (&amp;lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><fingerprint>eb895b5a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tânia Martins, Enoque Diniz, Luís M.

In the last decades, the use of zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) in biomedical research has increased. Anaesthesia is daily used in fish during experimental procedures to avoid discomfort, stress or pain. Also, fish welfare and the reliability of results can be compromised if an unsuitable anaesthetic protocol is used. Therefore, we aimed to refine anaesthetic protocols to be used in adult zebrafish by evaluating the efficacy of different anaesthetics, used alone or in combination. For that, zebrafish were randomly assigned to 8 different groups: 100 μg/mLMS-222 (MS); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate (E); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (E+L); 1.25 μg/mL propofol (P); 1.25 μg/mL propofol + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (P+L); 100 μg/mL ketamine (K); 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine (K+M); and 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine/3.125 μg/mL atipamezole (K+M/A). The animals were placed in an anaesthetic water bath, then, the following parameters were registered: time for equilibrium loss and anaesthesia induction, loss of sensitivity to soft and painful stimuli, respiratory rate, recovery time, and activity after recovery. The combined forms of E+L, P+L and K+M were the fastest to induce a surgical anaesthetic stage. Nevertheless, E+L induced respiratory depression, while K+M was shown to have the longer recovery time compared to MS-222, even when atipamezole was added. In conclusion, the P+L combination was shown to provide good anaesthesia with analgesia, without causing a major respiratory depression, providing as well a quick recovery, similar to MS-222.</content></content><author><name>Tânia Martins</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tânia Martins, Enoque Diniz, Luís M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Stillbirth rates remain high in many low-income settings, with fresh (intrapartum) stillbirths accounting for a large part due to limited obstetrical care. We aimed to determine the stillbirth rate and identify potentially modifiable factors associated with stillbirth in urban Guinea-Bissau.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was carried out by the Bandim Health Project (BHP), a Health and Demographic Surveillance System site in the capital Bissau. We assessed stillbirth rates in a hospital cohort consisting of all deliveries at the maternity ward at the National Hospital Simão Mendes (HNSM), and in a community cohort, which only included women from the BHP area. Stillbirth was classified as fresh (FSB) if fetal movements were reported on the day of delivery.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From October 1 2007 to April 15 2013, a total of 38164 deliveries were registered at HNSM, among them 3762 stillbirths (99/1000 births). Excluding deliveries referred to the hospital from outside the capital (9.6%), the HNSM stillbirth rate was 2786/34490 births (81/1000). During the same period, 15462 deliveries were recorded in the community cohort. Of these, 768 were stillbirths (50/1000).Of 11769 hospital deliveries among women from Bissau with data on fetal movement, 866 (74/1000) were stillbirths, and 609 (70.3%) of these were FSB, i.e. potentially preventable. The hospital FSB rate was highest in the evening from 4 pm to midnight (P = 0.04). In the community cohort, antenatal care (ANC) attendance correlated strongly with stillbirth reduction; the stillbirth rate was 71/1000 if the mother attended no ANC consultations vs. 36/1000 if she attended ≥7 consultations (P&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In Bissau, the stillbirth rate is alarmingly high. The majority of stillbirths are preventable FSB. Improving obstetrical training, labour management (including sufficient intrapartum monitoring and timely intervention) and hospital infrastructure is urgently required. This should be combined with proper community strategies and additional focus on antenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Morten Bjerregaard-Andersen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Morten Bjerregaard-Andersen, Najaaraq Lund, Anne Sofie Pinstrup Joergensen, Frida Starup Jepsen, Holger Werner Unger, Mama Mane, Amabelia Rodrigues, Staffan Bergström, Christine Stabell Benn&lt;/p&gt;

This should be combined with proper community strategies and additional focus on antenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197680</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2331:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00017</originId><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><published>1526270400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00017</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00017</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Analysis of the Role of the Conserved Disulfide in Amyloid Formation by Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide in Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Environments</title><fingerprint>a955b375</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00017/20180514/images/medium/bi-2018-00017v_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00017&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Aim &lt;p&gt;To determine choroidal thickness in healthy Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study; healthy Indian subjects (n = 230) with no history of ocular and/or systemic disorders were enrolled in the study. Choroidal thickness was measured for 230 eyes using SS-OCT. Subjects were divided into six age groups. Main outcome measures were subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular choroidal thickness (MCT) up to 3 mm at 500-micron interval from the fovea was measured in eight different quadrants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean SFCT was 307±79 μm and mean MCT was 285±75 μm. No difference in the choroidal thickness was found among genders. Mean SFCT of the different age groups was 327±68 μm (12–18 years), 364±70 μm (18.1–30 years), 321±78 μm (30.1–40 years), 304±79 μm (40.1–50 years), 283±69 μm (50.1–60 years) and 262±72μm (above 60 years; p &amp;lt;0.001; One way ANOVA). Mean macular choroidal thickness was 305±60 μm, 342±61 μm, 306±72 μm, 282±79 μm, 261±66 μm, 238±68μm respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001; one way ANOVA). A significant weak negative correlation was found between age with SFCT (r = -0.368, p&amp;lt;0.001) and MCT (r = -0.40, p&amp;lt;0.001). No significant correlation was found with refractive error, axial length and ocular perfusion pressure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that mean SFCT and MCT was 307±79μm and 285±75 μm, respectively, among healthy Indian subjects.

Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34408</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item><item>Human Biology and Medicine</item></keywords><crawled>1527691527380</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163b182c4d4:2822c39:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05349-w</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163db847505:6839453:2835af05</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05349-w</link><title>Cloak conceals contents from magnetic ‘eyes’</title><fingerprint>d19b4cf2</fingerprint><engagement>0</engagement><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cloak conceals contents from magnetic ‘eyes’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloak conceals contents from magnetic ‘eyes’, Published online: 07 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05349-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05349-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Device is not dependent on supercooling to foil magnetic fields.</content></content><published>1528354800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cloak conceals contents from magnetic ‘eyes’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloak conceals contents from magnetic ‘eyes’, Published online: 07 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05349-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05349-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Device is not dependent on supercooling to foil magnetic fields.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05349-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528396281093</crawled><visual><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05349-w/d41586-018-05349-w_15819598.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35828</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527552000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35828</canonicalUrl><engagement>118</engagement><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35828</link><title>Functional and structural characterization of an ECF-type ABC transporter for vitamin B12</title><fingerprint>785e2dbd</fingerprint><description>Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is the most complex B-type vitamin and is synthetized exclusively in a limited number of prokaryotes.

ERVcaller consistently showed the highest sensitivity and precision for detecting and genotyping non-reference unfixed TEs, particularly ERVs, as well as produce the most accurate breakpoints at single nucleotide resolution, especially under low sequencing depths. By applying ERVcaller to the 1000 Genomes Project samples, we detected 100% of the ERVs and 95% of the TEs that were experimentally validated. In conclusion, ERVcaller is capable of accurately identifying and genotyping non-reference unfixed ERVs and other TEs using NGS data.

The mammalian secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily contains functionally diverse members, among which the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) display similar subunits. We searched for molecular similarities between Fel d 1 and ABP to examine the possibility that they play similar roles. We aimed to i) cluster the evolutionary relationships of the SCGB superfamily; ii) identify divergence patterns, structural overlap, and protein-protein docking between Fel d 1 and ABP dimers; and iii) explore the residual interaction between ABP dimers and steroid binding in chemical communication using computational approaches. We also report that the evolutionary tree of the SCGB superfamily comprises seven unique palm-like clusters, showing the evolutionary pattern and divergence time tree of Fel d 1 with 28 ABP paralogs. Three ABP subunits (A27, BG27, and BG26) share phylogenetic relationships with Fel d 1 chains. The Fel d 1 and ABP subunits show similarities in terms of sequence conservation, identical motifs and binding site clefts. Topologically equivalent positions were visualized through superimposition of ABP A27:BG27 (AB) and ABP A27:BG26 (AG) dimers on a heterodimeric Fel d 1 model. In docking, Fel d 1-ABP dimers exhibit the maximum surface binding ability of AG compared with that of AB dimers and the several polar interactions between ABP dimers with steroids. Hence, cat Fel d 1 is an ABP-like molecule in which monomeric chains 1 and 2 are the equivalent of the ABPA and ABPBG monomers, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</content></content><author><name>Rajesh Durairaj</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rajesh Durairaj, Patrick Pageat, Cécile Bienboire-Frosini&lt;/p&gt;

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt;, currently affecting more than 200 million people. Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</content></content><author><name>Maria A.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods. As exemplified by the targeted gene identification of a master regulator WRI1, which regulates fatty acid biosynthesis, we found that the improved ChIP method worked well. We analyzed percentage input and fold changes of the ChIPed DNA. We also made successful ChIP-seq libraries using this method. This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</content></content><author><name>Mohammad Enamul Haque</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Honey from the European honeybee, &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;, is produced by α-glucosidases (HBGases) and is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Categorized by their substrate specificities, HBGases have three isoforms: HBGase I, II and III. Previous experimental investigations showed that wild-type HBGase III from &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; (WT) preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while the Y227H mutant (MT) preferred maltose to sucrose. This mutant can potentially be used for malt hydrolysis because it can efficiently hydrolyze maltose. In this work, to elucidate important factors contributing to substrate specificity of this enzyme and gain insight into how the Y227H mutation causes substrate specificity change, WT and MT homology models were constructed, and sucrose/maltose was docked into active sites of the WT and MT. AMBER14 was employed to perform three independent molecular dynamics runs for these four complexes. Based on the relative binding free energies calculated by the MM-GBSA method, sucrose is better than maltose for WT binding, while maltose is better than sucrose for MT binding. These rankings support the experimentally observed substrate specificity that WT preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while MT preferred maltose to sucrose, suggesting the importance of binding affinity for substrate specificity. We also found that the Y227H mutation caused changes in the proximities between the atoms necessary for sucrose/maltose hydrolysis that may affect enzyme efficiency in the hydrolysis of sucrose/maltose. Moreover, the per-residue binding free energy decomposition results show that Y227/H227 may be a key residue for preference binding of sucrose/maltose in the WT/MT active site. Our study provides important and novel insight into the binding of sucrose/maltose in the active site of &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; HBGase III and into how the Y227H mutation leads to the substrate specificity change at the molecular level. This knowledge could be beneficial in the design of this enzyme for increased production of desired products.</content></content><author><name>Pratchaya Pramoj Na Ayutthaya</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pratchaya Pramoj Na Ayutthaya, Chanpen Chanchao, Surasak Chunsrivirot&lt;/p&gt;

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine. Porcupine is free, open source, and released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OPful2fUMb8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1525984928890</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tim van Mourik, Lukas Snoek, Tomas Knapen, David G.

Stressor-exposure has been shown to exacerbate inflammation and change the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota; however stressor-induced effects on microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors are unknown. Thus, bacterial-produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as microbial community composition, were assessed in the colons of mice exposed to stress during infection with &lt;i&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/i&gt;. Mice were exposed to overnight restraint on 7 consecutive nights, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first exposure of restraint, mice were orally challenged with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt; or with vehicle. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SCFA levels measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Pathogen levels and colonic inflammation were also assessed 6 days post-infection. Results demonstrated that the microbial community structure and SCFA production were significantly affected by both stressor exposure and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt;-infection. Exposure to prolonged restraint in the absence of infection significantly reduced SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid). Multiple bacterial taxa were affected by stressor exposure, with the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; being significantly reduced and directly correlated with propionic acid. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; abundances were inversely correlated with colonic inflammation, supporting the contention that &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; helps to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses. Our data indicates that restraint stressor can have significant effects on pathogen-induced colonic inflammation and suggest that stressor-induced changes in the microbiota, microbial-produced SCFAs and their receptors may be involved.</content></content><author><name>Ross M.

Group B &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GBS) carriage by pregnant women is the primary risk factor for early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent this transmission route, and two main approaches are recommended to base the selection of pregnant women to be submitted to IAP: the risk-based and the culture-based strategies. In Brazil, compliance to such recommendations is poor, and not much is known about GBS carriage. In the present study, 3,647 pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were screened for GBS anogenital colonization, over a period of 8 years (2008–2015). GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies.</content></content><author><name>Ana Caroline N.

Further, the marked increase in cell proliferation on 3D-HCS confirmed the suitability of these materials as scaffolds for soft tissue engineering.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Wet_Electrospinning_of_Poly_butylene_succinate_PBS_Copolyester_into_Helically_Coiled_3D_Structures/6353402</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527256681727</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16397978cff:449b47:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saving the climate without sacrifice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saving the climate without sacrifice, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05344-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Modern trends such as car-sharing could help to limit warming.</description><author><name>NA</name></author><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163cbe8f071:4e526d4:7cfe07d6</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1</link><title>Saving the climate without sacrifice</title><fingerprint>e9cdd401</fingerprint><engagement>4</engagement><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saving the climate without sacrifice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saving the climate without sacrifice, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05344-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Modern trends such as car-sharing could help to limit warming.</content></content><published>1528095600000</published><engagementRate>0.05</engagementRate><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05344-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528134430833</crawled><visual><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05344-1/d41586-018-05344-1_15816128.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25721-0</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Adriano M.

The identification of POS as endogenous stimuli of mTORC1 in the RPE provides a mechanistic link underlying the photoreceptor-RPE interaction in the outer retina.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/532/eaag3315?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527617755574</crawled><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_163ad1d19b6:211c224:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5444.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Digvijay Singh, John Mallon, Anustup Poddar, Yanbo Wang, Ramreddy Tippana, Olivia Yang, Scott Bailey, Taekjip Ha</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5444</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5444.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><title>Real-time observation of DNA target interrogation and product release by the RNA-guided endonuclease CRISPR Cpf1 (Cas12a) [Biophysics and Computational Biology]</title><fingerprint>cc7d471</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>CRISPR-Cas9, which imparts adaptive immunity against foreign genomic invaders in certain prokaryotes, has been repurposed for genome-engineering applications.

Synthetic biologists construct innovative genetic/biological systems to treat environmental, energy, and health problems. Many systems employ rewired cells for non-native product synthesis, while a few have employed the rewired cells as ‘smart’ devices with programmable function. Building on the latter, we developed a genetic construct to control and direct bacterial motility towards hydrogen peroxide, one of the body’s immune response signaling molecules. A motivation for this work is the creation of cells that can target and autonomously treat disease, the latter signaled by hydrogen peroxide release. Bacteria naturally move towards a variety of molecular cues (e.g., nutrients) in the process of chemotaxis. In this work, we engineered bacteria to recognize and move towards hydrogen peroxide, a non-native chemoattractant and potential toxin. Our system exploits &lt;i&gt;oxyRS&lt;/i&gt;, the native oxidative stress regulon of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;.

To examine the 20-year trends in the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0–6 years between 1995 and 2015 in Harbin, China, we selected altogether 49,553 children aged 0–6 years old by using a multistage stratified cluster sampling methods in Harbin, one provincial capital city in northeast China in 1995, 2005 and 2015. Height and weight information of the children were collected. We used the child growth standards of World Health Organization to calculate the Z-scores for body mass index (BMI). Cut-offs recommended by World Health Organization and International Obesity Task Force were used to define overweight and obesity for each children. We found there is no difference between boys’ BMI and girls’ among newborns in each survey point (p&gt;0.05), but in older age groups, the BMI of boys was higher than that of girls (p&amp;lt;0.05). From 1995 to 2015, the average BMI was increasing continuously among boys older than 42 months and girls older than 48 months (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for linear trend across year) in Harbin. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 2.6% in 1995 to 7.6% in 2015. For every 10-year the risk of combined overweight and obesity in children aged 0–6 years increased by 167% (95%CI: 146%, 188%, p&amp;lt;0.01). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in most age subgroups showed an increasing trend over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for trend test across survey year). The age when the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity dramatically increased was earlier in 2015 than that in 2005 and 1995. In conclusion, there was an increasing trend of the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity during the past 20 years in Harbin and the age when the prevalence dramatically increased became earlier. Comprehensive intervention should be undertaken among younger children to prevent and control children’s overweight and obesity.</content></content><author><name>Wei Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Liu, Qin Li, Hui Li, Jia Li, Hai-Jun Wang, Bin Li&lt;/p&gt;

From 1995 to 2015, the average BMI was increasing continuously among boys older than 42 months and girls older than 48 months (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for linear trend across year) in Harbin. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 2.6% in 1995 to 7.6% in 2015. For every 10-year the risk of combined overweight and obesity in children aged 0–6 years increased by 167% (95%CI: 146%, 188%, p&amp;lt;0.01). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in most age subgroups showed an increasing trend over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for trend test across survey year). The age when the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity dramatically increased was earlier in 2015 than that in 2005 and 1995. In conclusion, there was an increasing trend of the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity during the past 20 years in Harbin and the age when the prevalence dramatically increased became earlier. Comprehensive intervention should be undertaken among younger children to prevent and control children’s overweight and obesity.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198032</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b77e:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1525813200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1525813200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</link><title>Keeping up with sea-level rise: Carbonate production rates in Palau and Yap, western Pacific Ocean</title><fingerprint>504f9ef5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert van Woesik, Christopher William Cacciapaglia&lt;/p&gt;
Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion. Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</content></content><author><name>Robert van Woesik</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert van Woesik, Christopher William Cacciapaglia&lt;/p&gt;

During clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast cells, short actin filaments (&amp;lt; 200nm) and crosslinking protein fimbrin assemble to drive the internalization of the plasma membrane. However, the organization of the actin meshwork during endocytosis remains largely unknown. In addition, only a small fraction of the force necessary to elongate and pinch off vesicles can be accounted for by actin polymerization alone. In this paper, we used mathematical modeling to study the self-organization of rigid actin filaments in the presence of elastic crosslinkers in conditions relevant to endocytosis. We found that actin filaments condense into either a disordered meshwork or an ordered bundle depending on filament length and the mechanical and kinetic properties of the crosslinkers. Our simulations also demonstrated that these nanometer-scale actin structures can store a large amount of elastic energy within the crosslinkers (up to 10&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; per crosslinker). This conversion of binding energy into elastic energy is the consequence of geometric constraints created by the helical pitch of the actin filaments, which results in frustrated configurations of crosslinkers attached to filaments. We propose that this stored elastic energy can be used at a later time in the endocytic process. As a proof of principle, we presented a simple mechanism for sustained torque production by ordered detachment of crosslinkers from a pair of parallel filaments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HugZ5m7-OgU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527626526848</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rui Ma, Julien Berro&lt;/p&gt;

Due to the claimed C-C bond breaking ability, Rh-containing systems are intensively investigated and widely recognized as the most promising candidates as anode materials for ethanol-feed low temperature fuel cells. This study aims at verifying the claim of beneficial role of Rh towards C-C bond scission during low temperature ethanol electrooxidation on Pt-Rh nanoparticles. We determined that the surface-normalized amounts of CO2 produced during ethanol oxidation are comparable on Pt, Rh and Pt-Rh nanoalloys, and smaller than CO2 amounts obtained on exactly the same electrode from oxidation of monolayer of adsorbed CO. The whole amount of CO2 detected during ethanol oxidation, regardless of Rh presence, or lack of thereof, seems to come exclusively from oxidation of submonolayer of COads produced during dissociative adsorption of ethanol at low electrode potential, and its subsequent oxidation at sufficiently high electrode potential.

Due to the claimed C-C bond breaking ability, Rh-containing systems are intensively investigated and widely recognized as the most promising candidates as anode materials for ethanol-feed low temperature fuel cells. This study aims at verifying the claim of beneficial role of Rh towards C-C bond scission during low temperature ethanol electrooxidation on Pt-Rh nanoparticles. We determined that the surface-normalized amounts of CO2 produced during ethanol oxidation are comparable on Pt, Rh and Pt-Rh nanoalloys, and smaller than CO2 amounts obtained on exactly the same electrode from oxidation of monolayer of adsorbed CO. The whole amount of CO2 detected during ethanol oxidation, regardless of Rh presence, or lack of thereof, seems to come exclusively from oxidation of submonolayer of COads produced during dissociative adsorption of ethanol at low electrode potential, and its subsequent oxidation at sufficiently high electrode potential. Our work suggest that Rh-containing alloys are not more active towards C-C bond scission than pure Pt, and on both metals the mechanism of oxidation of ethanol to CO2 proceeds via the submonolayer of COads, which limits the quantity of CO2 produced from ethanol at room temperature to negligible amount.

Gelsolin (GSN) protein, expressed in circulating monocytes, was previously reported to be associated with osteoporosis in both Chinese and Caucasian women. This study aims to test if plasma GSN protein level is associated with hip bone mineral density (BMD) in Chinese population. Based on two study Groups containing 6,308 old Chinese, we adopted extreme sampling scheme and selected 3 independent samples (Subgroups 1–3) for discovery, replication, and validation purposes. We tested plasma GSN concentration, and analyzed whether plasma GSN level differs between subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD. In Group 1 (N = 1,860), the plasma GSN level increased in the female with low BMD, which was discovered in the Subgroup 1 (N = 42, p = 0.093) and replicated in the Subgroup 2 (N = 39, p = 0.095). With more extreme sampling for the Subgroup 3 from the Group 2 (N = 4,448), the difference of plasma GSN level in the female with low BMD vs. high BMD is more significant (N = 45, p = 0.037). After the subjects were pooled from Subgroups 2 and 3, the difference in plasma GSN between low and high BMD subjects became even more significant (p = 0.016). The plasma GSN level was negatively correlated with total hip BMD (r = -0.26, p = 0.033). We concluded that plasma GSN was associated with hip BMD in Chinese postmenopausal women and plasma GSN might be a potential risk biomarker for osteoporosis.</content></content><author><name>Wen-Yu Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Yu Wang, Bing Ge, Ju Shi, Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Chang-Hua Tang, Dong-Cheng Zhu, Hong Zhu, Xing-Bo Mo, Yong-Hong Zhang, Fei-Yan Deng, Shu-Feng Lei&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to identify potential CpG site(s) or DNA methylation pattern(s) in the pseudo α-globin 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene), the gene which locates in α-thalassemia-1 deletion mutation, to differentiate plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;DNA methylation profiles of placenta and peripheral blood from the MethBase database were compared to screen differentially methylated regions. This region was confirmed the differential by methylation-sensitive high resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. The differential region was used to compare DNA methylation profile of plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women by bisulfite amplicon sequencing in three levels: overall, individual CpG sites and individual molecules (DNA methylation patterns).&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Using MethBase data, four consecutive CpG sites in the &lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene were identified as regions of differential DNA methylation between placenta and peripheral blood. The confirmation by MS-HRM showed the differential DNA methylation profile between the placenta and plasma from non-pregnant women. The comparison of DNA methylation profiles between the plasma of pregnant and non-pregnant women showed that, in the overall levels of the four CpG sites, DNA methylation of pregnant women was detected at lower levels than non-pregnant women. In the individual CpG site level, only the second CpG site showed differential DNA methylation between the groups. In the DNA methylation pattern level, there was no strongly significant differences in DNA methylation patterns between the pregnant and non-pregnant groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our result demonstrated that, in the plasma from pregnant women, only one of the four CpG sites displays a decrease in DNA methylation compared with non-pregnant women. It indicates that this CpG site might be useful for determining the presence or absence of fetal wild-type α-globin gene cluster allele in maternal plasma.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Tanapat Pangeson</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tanapat Pangeson, Torpong Sanguansermsri, Khwanruedee Mahingsa, Phanchana Sanguansermsri&lt;/p&gt;

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</content></content><author><name>Nathan K.

The identification of germplasm resources is an important aspect of sugarcane breeding. The aim of this study was to introduce a new method for identifying &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny. First, we cloned and sequenced nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrDNA-ITS) sequences from 20 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms. Analysis of these nrDNA-ITS sequences showed a stable mutation at base 89. Primers (FO13, RO13, FI16, and RI16) were then designed for tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR based on mutations at base 89 of the nrDNA-ITS sequence. An additional 71 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms were identified using this tetra-primer ARMS PCR method, which confirmed that the method using the described primers successfully identified &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and progeny.

These results may help improve the efficiency of modern molecular breeding of sugarcane and lay a foundation for identification of sugarcane germplasms and the relationships among them.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197458</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b9:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0030-x</originId><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Maria Maryanovich</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>677</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0030-x/MediaObjects/41591_2018_30_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><engagement>69</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0030-x</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0030-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche</title><fingerprint>e0acb2f4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0030-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0030-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Loss of sympathetic nerve innervention of the bone marrow contributes to the aging of hematopoietic stem cells, which can be rejuvenated using an adrenergic receptor agonist.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/2ekhJMwiDYk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1525676400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0030-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0030-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Loss of sympathetic nerve innervention of the bone marrow contributes to the aging of hematopoietic stem cells, which can be rejuvenated using an adrenergic receptor agonist.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/2ekhJMwiDYk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/2ekhJMwiDYk/s41591-018-0030-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><crawled>1525706901788</crawled><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_1633b37c91c:2a60622:5785ab88</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/973-b?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527788426000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/973.2.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>58</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/973-b?rss=1</link><title>U.S. budget targets fish and wildlife work</title><fingerprint>851cac9</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d09b6:2835af05</id><author><name>Payne, J.

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</content></content><author><name>Lucia Bizovska</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses. Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</content></content><author><name>Alfred Obia</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfred Obia, Jan Mulder, Sarah Elizabeth Hale, Neneng Laela Nurida, Gerard Cornelissen&lt;/p&gt;

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, endogenous RNAs that post-transcriptionally repress mRNAs. Over the course of evolution, many new miRNAs are known to have emerged and added to the existing miRNA repertoires of drosophilids and vertebrates. Despite the large number of miRNAs in existence, the complementary pairing of only ~7 bases between miRNAs and mRNAs is sufficient to induce repression. Thus, miRNA targeting is so widespread that genes coexpressed with a miRNA have evolved to avoid sites that are targeted by the miRNA. Besides this avoidance, little is known about the preferential modes of miRNA targeting. Therefore, to elucidate miRNA targeting preference and avoidance, we evaluated the bias of the number of miRNA targeting occurrences in relation to expression intensities of miRNAs and their coexpressed target mRNAs by surveying transcriptome data from human organs. We found that miRNAs preferentially target genes with intermediate levels of expression, while avoiding highly expressed ones, and that older miRNAs have greater targeting specificity, suggesting that specificity increases during the course of evolution.</content></content><author><name>Hisakazu Iwama</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hisakazu Iwama, Kiyohito Kato, Hitomi Imachi, Koji Murao, Tsutomu Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

Impairment in work function is a frequent outcome in patients with chronic conditions such as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), depression and anxiety disorders. The personal and economic costs of work impairment in these disorders are immense. Symptoms of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety are potentially remediable forms of distress that may contribute to work impairment in chronic health conditions such as IMID. The present study evaluated the association between pain [Medical Outcomes Study Pain Effects Scale], fatigue [Daily Fatigue Impact Scale], depression and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] and work impairment [Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scale] in four patient populations: multiple sclerosis (n = 255), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 248, rheumatoid arthritis (n = 154) and a depression and anxiety group (n = 307), using quantile regression, controlling for the effects of sociodemographic factors, physical disability, and cognitive deficits. Each of pain, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and fatigue individually showed significant associations with work absenteeism, presenteeism, and general activity impairment (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.3 to 1.0). When the distress variables were entered concurrently into the regression models, fatigue was a significant predictor of work and activity impairment in all models (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.2 to 0.5). These findings have important clinical implications for understanding the determinants of work impairment and for improving work-related outcomes in chronic disease.</content></content><author><name>Murray W.

Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal propagule bank could facilitate the regeneration and plantation of seedlings in disturbed area. In this study, Masson pine (&lt;i&gt;Pinus massoniana&lt;/i&gt;) seedlings were used to bait the ECM fungal propagule bank buried in the soils collected from a manganese (Mn) mine wasteland and a non-polluted area in China. After 6-month growth, we found the seedlings grown in the Mn mine soil (Mn:3200 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) did not display any toxicity symptoms. Based on morphotyping and ITS-PCR sequencing, we identified a total of 16 ECM fungal OTUs (operative taxonomic units) at 97% similarity threshold, among which 11 OTUs were recovered in the Mn mine soils and 14 in the non-polluted soil. Two soil types shared 9 OTUs and both of them were dominated by a &lt;i&gt;Tylospora&lt;/i&gt; sp. Based on those soil propagule banks in Masson pine forests reported in previous, we speculated that some Atheliaceae species may be preferred in the soil propagule bank of some pine species, such as Masson pine. In addition, NMDS ordination displayed geographical position effects on soil propagule banks in five Masson pine forest from three sites at regional scale. In conclusion, Masson pine ECM seedlings could grow well in the Mn wasteland as a suitable tree species used for reforestation application in Mn mineland, in addition, Mn pollution did not alter the dominant ECM fungal species in the soil propagule banks.</content></content><author><name>Jian Huang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Huang, Qisheng Han, Junjian Li&lt;/p&gt;

Arnold, Sally Caine, Behzad M. Toosi, Valerie M. K. Verge, Gillian D. Muir&lt;/p&gt;
One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</content></content><author><name>Atiq Hassan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atiq Hassan, Breanna M.

Cells switch between quiescence and proliferation states for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regeneration. At the restriction point (R-point), cells become irreversibly committed to the completion of the cell cycle independent of mitogen. The mechanism involving hyper-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and activation of transcription factor E2F is linked to the R-point passage. However, stress stimuli trigger exit from the cell cycle back to the mitogen-sensitive quiescent state after Rb hyper-phosphorylation but only until APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; inactivation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to investigate the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation in mammalian cells with respect to mitogen and stress signals. The model integrates the current mechanistic knowledge and accounts for the recent experimental observations with cells exiting quiescence and proliferating cells. We show that Cyclin E:Cdk2 couples Rb-E2F and APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable switches and temporally segregates the R-point and the G1/S transition. A redox-dependent mutual antagonism between APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; and its inhibitor Emi1 makes the inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable. We show that the levels of Cdk inhibitor (CKI) and mitogen control the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation. Further, we propose that shifting of the mitogen-induced transcriptional program to G2-phase in proliferating cells might result in an intermediate Cdk2 activity at the mitotic exit and in the immediate inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Our study builds a coherent framework and generates hypotheses that can be further explored by experiments.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198420</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84553:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05139-4</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>David Cyranoski</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>73</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05139-4</link><unread>True</unread><title>﻿Sacked Japanese biologist gets chance to retrain at Crick institute</title><fingerprint>d17e5239</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;﻿Sacked Japanese biologist gets chance to retrain at Crick institute&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;﻿Sacked Japanese biologist gets chance to retrain at Crick institute, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05139-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05139-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Yoshinori Watanabe hopes to revive his career by attending a year-long retraining programme.</content></content><published>1526367600000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;﻿Sacked Japanese biologist gets chance to retrain at Crick institute&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;﻿Sacked Japanese biologist gets chance to retrain at Crick institute, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05139-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05139-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Yoshinori Watanabe hopes to revive his career by attending a year-long retraining programme.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05139-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16363e65dda:376fb1c:3dd877af</id><crawled>1526389431770</crawled><visual><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05139-4/d41586-018-05139-4_15764120.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02717</originId><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId></origin><published>1526356800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02717</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02717</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Surface Properties of Fluorite in Presence of Water: An Atomistic Investigation</title><fingerprint>fdebe70a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02717/20180514/images/medium/jp-2018-027174_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02717&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

For the last 100 years, it has been uncontroversial to state that the plant germline is set aside late in development, but there is surprisingly little evidence to support this view. In contrast, much evolutionary theory and several recent empirical studies seem to suggest the opposite—that the germlines of some and perhaps most plants may be set aside early in development. But is this really the case? How much does it matter? How can we reconcile the new evidence with existing knowledge of plant development? And is there a way to reliably establish the timing of germline segregation in both model and nonmodel plants? Answering these questions is vital to understanding one of the most fundamental aspects of plant development and evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0LiCyHbkEf4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526494327964</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Lanfear&lt;/p&gt;

The stress-induced mutagenesis hypothesis postulates that in response to stress, bacteria increase their genome-wide mutation rate, in turn increasing the chances that a descendant is able to better withstand the stress. This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell divisions are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YW43eur48VA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527181201615</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

The earlier COSMO cavity construction algorithms are described for comparison. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25342?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1639679584a:2569c5:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26884-6</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Ying-Chin Lin</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26884-6</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26884-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Author Correction: The Methylation Capacity of Arsenic and Insulin Resistance are Associated with Psychological Characteristics in Children and Adolescents</title><fingerprint>b66e5772</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: The Methylation Capacity of Arsenic and Insulin Resistance are Associated with Psychological Characteristics in Children and Adolescents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: The Methylation Capacity of Arsenic and Insulin Resistance are Associated with Psychological Characteristics in Children and Adolescents, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26884-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26884-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: The Methylation Capacity of Arsenic and Insulin Resistance are Associated with Psychological Characteristics in Children and Adolescents&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/hE2VLfvbkm8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1528268400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: The Methylation Capacity of Arsenic and Insulin Resistance are Associated with Psychological Characteristics in Children and Adolescents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: The Methylation Capacity of Arsenic and Insulin Resistance are Associated with Psychological Characteristics in Children and Adolescents, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26884-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26884-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: The Methylation Capacity of Arsenic and Insulin Resistance are Associated with Psychological Characteristics in Children and Adolescents&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/hE2VLfvbkm8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/hE2VLfvbkm8/s41598-018-26884-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528269569247</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163d3f6fcdf:5b12a24:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/320887v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Chen, L.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/13/320887</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/320887v1?rss=1</link><title>MS-PyCloud: An open-source, cloud computing-based pipeline for LC-MS/MS data analysis [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>1bf72ade</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Rapid development and wide adoption of mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies have empowered scientists to study proteins and their modifications in complex samples on a large scale.

U., Leonard D. Browne, Xia Li, Fahd Adeeb, Fernando Perez-Ruiz, Alexander D. Fraser, Austin G. Stack&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Elevated serum uric acid (sUA) concentrations are common in the general population and are associated with chronic metabolic conditions and adverse clinical outcomes. We evaluated secular trends in the burden of hyperuricaemia from 2006–2014 within the Irish health system.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the &lt;i&gt;National Kidney Disease Surveillance Programme&lt;/i&gt; was used to determine the prevalence of elevated sUA in adults, age &gt; 18 years, within the Irish health system. Hyperuricaemia was defined as sUA &gt; 416.4 μmol/L in men and &gt; 339.06 μmol/L in women, and prevalence was calculated as the proportion of patients per year with mean sUA levels above sex-specific thresholds. Temporal trends in prevalence were compared from 2006 to 2014 while general estimating equations (GEE) explored variation across calendar years expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2014, prevalence of hyperuricaemia increased from 19.7% to 25.0% in men and from 20.5% to 24.1% in women, P&amp;lt;0.001. The corresponding sUA concentrations increased significantly from 314.6 (93.9) in 2006 to 325.6 (96.2) in 2014, P&amp;lt;0.001.

Background &lt;p&gt;Elevated serum uric acid (sUA) concentrations are common in the general population and are associated with chronic metabolic conditions and adverse clinical outcomes. We evaluated secular trends in the burden of hyperuricaemia from 2006–2014 within the Irish health system.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the &lt;i&gt;National Kidney Disease Surveillance Programme&lt;/i&gt; was used to determine the prevalence of elevated sUA in adults, age &gt; 18 years, within the Irish health system. Hyperuricaemia was defined as sUA &gt; 416.4 μmol/L in men and &gt; 339.06 μmol/L in women, and prevalence was calculated as the proportion of patients per year with mean sUA levels above sex-specific thresholds. Temporal trends in prevalence were compared from 2006 to 2014 while general estimating equations (GEE) explored variation across calendar years expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2014, prevalence of hyperuricaemia increased from 19.7% to 25.0% in men and from 20.5% to 24.1% in women, P&amp;lt;0.001. The corresponding sUA concentrations increased significantly from 314.6 (93.9) in 2006 to 325.6 (96.2) in 2014, P&amp;lt;0.001. Age-specific prevalence increased in all groups from 2006 to 2014, and the magnitude of increase was similar for each age category. Adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics and illness indicators, the likelihood of hyperuricemia was greatest for patients in 2014; OR 1.45 (1.26–1.65) for men and OR 1.47 (1.29–1.67) in women vs 2006 (referent). Factors associated with hyperuricaemia included: worsening kidney function, elevated white cell count, raised serum phosphate and calcium levels, elevated total protein and higher haemoglobin concentrations, all P&amp;lt;0.001.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The burden of hyperuricaemia is substantial in the Irish health system and has increased in frequency over the past decade.

Although NF-{kappa}B signaling exhibits significant variability across single cells, some target genes exhibit fold-change detection of NF-{kappa}B, which may buffer against stochastic variation in signaling molecules. However, this observation was made at target genes supporting high levels of TNF-inducible transcription. It is unknown if fold-change detection is maintained at NF-{kappa}B target genes with low levels of TNF-inducible transcription, for which stochastic promoter events may be more pronounced. Here we used a microfluidic cell-trapping device to measure how TNF-induced activation of NF-{kappa}B controls transcription in single Jurkat T cells at the promoters of integrated HIV and the endogenous cytokine gene IL6, which produce only a few transcripts per cell. We tracked TNF-stimulated NF-{kappa}B RelA nuclear translocation by live-cell imaging and then quantified transcript number by RNA FISH in the same cell. We found that TNF-induced transcription correlates with fold change in nuclear NF-{kappa}B with similar strength at low versus high abundance target genes. A computational model of TNF-NF-{kappa}B signaling, which implements fold-change detection from competition for binding to {kappa}B motifs, was sufficient to reproduce fold-change detection across the experimentally measured range of transcript outputs. Nevertheless, we found that gene-specific trends in transcriptional noise and levels of promoter-bound NF-{kappa}B predicted by the model were inconsistent with our experimental observations at low abundance gene targets.

Prenatal detection of the fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; status can be useful in the management of RhD incompatibility to identify fetuses at risk of hemolytic disease. Hemolytic disease causes morbidity and mortality of the fetus in the neonatal period. The routine use of antenatal and postnatal anti-D prophylaxis has reduced the incidence of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. This study describe the detection of fetal RhD antigens in blood of RhD negative pregnant women using a nanopolymer coated electrochemical biosensor for medical diagnosis. Cell free fetal DNA in maternal plasma was also used to genotyping fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; status using multiplex real-time PCR. Twenty-six RhD negative pregnant women in different gestational ages were included in the study. RhD positive fetal antibodies detected with a developed biosensor in maternal blood of RhD negative mothers. The electrochemical measurements were performed on a PalmSens potentiostat, and corundum ceramic based screen printed gold electrode combined with the reference Ag/AgCl electrode, and the auxiliary Au/Pd (98/2%) electrode. Fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; genotyping performed using fluorescence-based multiplex real-time PCR exons 5 and 7 of the &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; gene. The fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; status of 26 RhD negative cases were detected 21 as RhD positive and 5 as RhD negative with electrochemical biosensor. Fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; status confirmed with extracted fetal DNA in maternal plasma using multiplex real-time PCR &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; genotyping and by serological test after delivery. The new method for fetal RhD detection in early pregnancy is useful and can be carry out rapidly in clinical diagnosis. Using automated biosensors are reproducible, quick and results can be generated within a few minutes compared to noninvasive fetal &lt;i&gt;RHD&lt;/i&gt; genotyping from maternal plasma with real-time PCR-based techniques.

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding and meeting the reproductive health needs of adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) is a growing concern since advances in antiretroviral therapy mean that many ALHIV are now living into adulthood and starting to have sex.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a mixed-methods study in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia to advance our understanding of the reproductive health needs of ALHIV and to assess the extent to which these needs are being met. We conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 32 ALHIV from two HIV clinics, 23 with their caregivers, and 10 with clinic staff. ALHIV were interviewed twice. We used the data from the qualitative interviews to create a cross-sectional survey that we conducted with 312 ALHIV in three HIV clinics.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of ALHIV reported they wanted to have children in the future but lacked knowledge about preventing mother-to-child transmission. Some sexually active adolescents used condoms, although they wanted more information about and access to non-condom methods. Many ALHIV reported that their first sexual encounters were forced. Religious beliefs prevented some caregivers from discussing premarital sex and contraception with ALHIV. Clinic staff and caregivers had mixed views about integrating contraceptive counseling and method provision into HIV care and treatment services. Few sexually active ALHIV reported that they disclosed their HIV status to their sexual partners and few reported that they knew their sexual partner’s status.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;ALHIV are in dire need of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services and information including a range of contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy, knowledge about preventing mother-to-child transmission and having a healthy pregnancy, skills related to HIV disclosure and condom negotiation to prevent horizontal transmission, and screening for sexual violence for both males and females if services are available.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Donna R.

Every chemical reaction is a tightrope walk. In fact, if you picture them traversing an energy surface it’s a literal tightrope walk, and you can see the narrow path that leads to the product, along with the various pits, slopes, and gulches that things can slide off into instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to figure this sort of thing out is to run a lot of careful attempts under well-controlled conditions: &lt;em&gt;scientia est experentia&lt;/em&gt;. In the drug industry, process research chemists do this because the stakes are high. People in academia who are trying to get crucial total synthesis steps to work are often in the same position, and (needless to say) so are the folks who are trying to invent new synthetic methods entirely. Most of the rest of us, though, will try a few variations while our thoughts turn to whether there are any different reagents or reactions that might be less complicated and just produce some product already. The reaction landscape is large and complex, and mapping it out in useful detail is actually rather painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/05/23/science.aar6236&quot;&gt;Here’s a new paper&lt;/a&gt; that is trying another automated attack on all this. A group at Merck (with collaborators at Bruker) reports another miniaturized approach to reaction screening, this time using MALDI-TOF mass spec as the analytic end of the process. It would appear to be later work from the same initiative that produced &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/11/25/try_some_reactions_actually_try_them_all&quot;&gt;this earlier work&lt;/a&gt; on reaction optimization, and for more industrial chemists trying this, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt; for some recent work from Pfizer. That paper investigated Suzuki-type couplings, and this new one is going after Buchwald-Hartwig ones (the carbon-nitrogen palladium-catalyzed reaction, famously &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/16/palladium-does-what-it-wants&quot;&gt;persnickety&lt;/a&gt; about catalysts and conditions). For a pain-in-the-rear reaction, though, it sure does &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/22/real_reactions_from_real_lab_notebooks&quot;&gt;get run a lot&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a very worthy place to set the machines loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Merck group looked back through the company’s electronic lab notebooks, and found plenty of such coupling reactions. But they were run under so many different conditions, and with such irregular coverage of chemical space, that it was hard to extract anything useful out of the data set. So they made their own. But they did it differently than the Pfizer group (who used flow chemistry, which requires homogeneous reactions and thus often higher dilution conditions):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .Rather than accepting such constraints, we systematically engineered and validated new plate-based nanomole synthesis tools with a general ability to carry out a wide variety of typical synthetic reactions. We identified effective chemically compatible glass microplate reactors, fast 384-tip dosing of reagent solutions in volatile solvents, and designed aluminum sealing blocks that can retain volatile solvents on heating. In addition, we used LabRam resonant acoustic mixing to both agitate reactions and to create milky slurries of solid inorganic bases that can be added to reactions by parallel liquid handling. Finally, we created a nanomole scale photochemistry tool to enable reaction evaluation in the rapidly growing field of photoredox catalysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not the work of a few idle afternoons. (A lot of information on how this was done is available in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/05/23/science.aar6236.DC1/aar6236_Lin_SM.pdf&quot;&gt;supplementary information file&lt;/a&gt; of the paper, by the way). The decision to use MALDI/TOF mass spec was motivated by the time it takes to do LC/MS work – the syringe has to come over, pull up some sample, inject it, get washed and move to the next sample while the first one is making its way down the column, etc. It’s true that you get more information from the LC trace, but the speedup in the solid-phase MALDI technique (where a laser beam blasts the sample off the surface and into the mass spec) is hard to ignore. The group did some optimization there, looking for conditions that would give reliable readouts across a range of substrates, and worked out a procedure where aliquots of each reaction were spotted into the wells of a MALDI analysis plate (with internal standard added – without that, you’re at sea) and the appropriate matrix compound (alpha-cyano 4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added afterwards in solution, followed by evaporation. A 1536-well MALDI plate could be analyzed in about ten minutes, with automated data collection and analysis on the back end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first run of the system looked at four different coupling conditions (iridium/nickel and ruthenium/nickel photoredox, along copper-catalyzed and palladium-catalyzed conditions) to search for functional groups that could poison the reaction conditions (as in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.7b00201&quot;&gt;work of the Glorius group&lt;/a&gt; on reaction &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/06/the_robustness_test_why_dont_we_just_require_it&quot;&gt;robustness&lt;/a&gt;). These four reactions were run with well-performing reactions partners in the presence of 383 other polar molecules with a wide range of functional groups. As always with the automated chemistry work, one’s lip starts to quiver at the thought of doing this sort of thing the traditional way. That is just a &lt;em&gt;lot of work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they found was that each of the reactions is subject to poisoning by specific functional groups. For example, the copper-catalyzed reactions are hammered by anything with a thiol group, which makes perfect sense, while the iridium reactions were not only intolerant to SH, but to acids, phenols, oximes, and nitro groups as well. Which is annoying. And when such functional groups appeared in larger, more complex additives, they were almost always just as bad. To add to the fun, there were other large molecules that contained several by-themselves-innocuous functional groups that together managed to poison the reaction as a team. Yep, this is metal-catalyzed coupling chemistry all right. (It’s worth noting that the copper reaction actually had the most permissive profile, thiols aside).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group then turned to variations in the coupling partners, with a list of 192 aryl halides and 192 secondary amines. If you did all of those, you’d be looking at 36,864 possible products, and across the four reaction types that gives you a cool 147,456 experiments to set up, which was enough even to give these guys pause. They tried a sampling of that space by setting up each bromide with the most simple amine in the set, and each amine with the most simple bromide – that takes you back down to 1536 reactions, a 1% scattering fairly evenly across the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a much harder row to hoe. Adding an internal standard is necessary, but a lot trickier to work out across so many reactions and structural types. The group had run that previous experiment in traditional LC/MS and found a good correlation in the results (once you normalized to the internal standard) but these 1536 experiments had a lot more scatter in them. Backing down to a pass/fail on the MALDI data (with an arbitrary cutoff) gave a much better correlation with the more comprehensive LC/MS data, so you can at least search reaction space in a “what’s bad?” mode, with analysis of the properties of each compound for steric hindrance, number of nitrogens, cLogP, hydrogen bond donors, etc. Rather particular structural features turn out to be reproducibly important for success and failure in the Cu-catalyzed versus the Pd-catalyzed reactions, and several of these cannot predicted by our current understanding of the reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper refers to the “dark matter” of chemical reactivity, and there’s some of it for you: things that you wouldn’t have known would affect the reaction, and do so for reasons that aren’t yet clear. These coupling reactions are particularly tricky to work out, but there are plenty of other examples in all fields of synthetic chemistry. (Going back to my grad school work, I can give examples of small changes across carbohydrate structures that totally change their reactivity, in ways that I often discovered in the most painful ways possible!) Every class of compounds and every class of reactions has things like this, results that just make you throw up your hands. If there’s a way to start mapping out the vast “Just One of Those Things” spaces, we’ll learn a lot more about the chemistry we’re supposed to already understand by doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1528292688000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Why do our reactions fail?

While previous work has shown that the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification is a useful, though subjective, feature for predicting surgical outcomes, obtaining this classification requires a clinician to review the patient&apos;s medical records. Our goal here is to create an improved risk score using electronic medical records and demonstrate its utility in predicting in-hospital mortality without requiring clinician-derived ASA scores. Methods: Data from 49,513 surgical patients were used to train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree classifiers for predicting in-hospital mortality. The features used are readily available before surgery from EMR databases. A gradient boosted tree regression model was trained to impute the ASA Physical Status Classification, and this new, imputed score was included as an additional feature to preoperatively predict in-hospital post-surgical mortality. The preoperative risk prediction was then used as an input feature to a deep neural network (DNN), along with intraoperative features, to predict postoperative in-hospital mortality risk. Performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: We found that the random forest classifier (AUC 0.921, 95%CI 0.908-0.934) outperforms logistic regression (AUC 0.871, 95%CI 0.841-0.900) and gradient boosted trees (AUC 0.897, 95%CI 0.881-0.912) in predicting in-hospital post-surgical mortality. Using logistic regression, the ASA Physical Status Classification score alone had an AUC of 0.865 (95%CI 0.848-0.882). Adding preoperative features to the ASA Physical Status Classification improved the random forest AUC to 0.929 (95%CI 0.915-0.943). Using only automatically obtained preoperative features with no clinician intervention, we found that the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.921 (95%CI 0.908-0.934). Integrating the preoperative risk prediction into the DNN for postoperative risk prediction results in an AUC of 0.924 (95%CI 0.905-0.941), and with both a preoperative and postoperative risk score for each patient, we were able to show that the mortality risk changes over time. Conclusions: Features easily extracted from EMR data can be used to preoperatively predict the risk of in-hospital post-surgical mortality in a fully automated fashion, with accuracy comparable to models trained on features that require clinical expertise. This preoperative risk score can then be compared to the postoperative risk score to show that the risk changes, and therefore should be monitored longitudinally over time.</content></content><published>1527231600000</published><description>Background: Predicting preoperative in-hospital mortality using readily-available electronic medical record (EMR) data can aid clinicians in accurately and rapidly determining surgical risk.

Mouse models of breast cancer with specific molecular subtypes (e.g., ER or HER2 positive) in an immunocompetent or an immunocompromised environment significantly contribute to our understanding of cancer biology, despite some limitations, and they give insight into targeted therapies. However, an ideal triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse model is lacking. What has been missing in the TNBC mouse model is a sequential progression of the disease in an essential native microenvironment. This notion inspired us to develop a TNBC-model in syngeneic mice using a mammary intraductal (MIND) method. To achieve this goal, Mvt-1and 4T1 TNBC mouse cell lines were injected into the mammary ducts via nipples of FVB/N mice and BALB/c wild-type immunocompetent mice, respectively. We established that the TNBC-MIND model in syngeneic mice could epitomize all breast cancer progression stages and metastasis into the lungs via lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination within four weeks. Collectively, the syngeneic mouse-TNBC-MIND model may serve as a unique platform for further investigation of the underlying mechanisms of TNBC growth and therapies.</content></content><author><name>Arnab Ghosh</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arnab Ghosh, Sandipto Sarkar, Snigdha Banerjee, Fariba Behbod, Ossama Tawfik, Douglas McGregor, Stephanie Graff, Sushanta K.

Tourette syndrome is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Comorbidities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder can be found. The overlap between neuroanatomical regions and neurotransmitter systems in the olfactory system and the pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome let us hypothesize altered olfactory performance in Tourette syndrome. The main objective of this study was to systematically assess olfactory functioning in subjects with Tourette syndrome and to compare it to healthy controls. We assessed 28 adults with Tourette syndrome (age 33.1±9.4 years, disease duration 23.7±9.7 years) and 28 healthy controls (age 32.9±9.0 years) matched in regard to age, sex, education and smoking habits. The “Sniffin Sticks” test battery was applied to assess odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. Additionally, the combined score of the odor threshold test, the odor discrimination test and the odor identification test of the “Sniffin Sticks” test battery was calculated. Although it was not the primary aim of this study, we assessed whether tics and comorbidity could contribute to olfactory alterations in adults with Tourette syndrome. Therefore, clinical scores were used to assess severity of tics and co-morbidity such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression in subjects with Tourette syndrome. Pathology of the nasal cavities was excluded with rhinoendoscopy. Independent sample t-tests were applied to compare performance in olfactory tests. In the case of statistically significant differences (critical p-value: 0.05), multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to explore whether tic severity, social impairment, co-morbidity or medical treatment had an impact on the differences found. Descriptive values are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Tourette syndrome subjects showed lower combined scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 31.9 ± 5.1 versus healthy controls 35.0 ± 3.1; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007), odor identification scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.4 ± 2.0 versus healthy controls 13.7 ± 1.4; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) and odor discrimination scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.1 ± 2.1 versus healthy controls 13.2 ± 1.6; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.041) in comparison to healthy subjects, while there was no difference in odor threshold (Tourette syndrome subjects 7.3 ± 2.7 versus healthy controls 8.1 ± 2.2; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.22). Seven out of 28 Tourette syndrome subjects (25%) scored in the range of the age- and sex-dependent combined score for hyposmia, while two of 28 healthy controls (7%) had a similar low combined score. None of the participants were found to have functional anosmia. Multiple linear regression analyses suggest that social impairment may a predictor for low combined score and odor identification score in Tourette syndrome subjects (p = 0.003). Compared to healthy controls, altered olfaction in adults with Tourette syndrome was found in this study. Normal odor threshold level but lower scores at tasks involving supra-threshold odor concentrations point towards a central-nervous alteration in the processing of olfactory information in Tourette syndrome.</content></content><author><name>Martin Kronenbuerger</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martin Kronenbuerger, Patrizia Belenghi, Justus Ilgner, Jessica Freiherr, Thomas Hummel, Irene Neuner&lt;/p&gt;

Pathology of the nasal cavities was excluded with rhinoendoscopy. Independent sample t-tests were applied to compare performance in olfactory tests. In the case of statistically significant differences (critical p-value: 0.05), multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to explore whether tic severity, social impairment, co-morbidity or medical treatment had an impact on the differences found. Descriptive values are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Tourette syndrome subjects showed lower combined scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 31.9 ± 5.1 versus healthy controls 35.0 ± 3.1; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007), odor identification scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.4 ± 2.0 versus healthy controls 13.7 ± 1.4; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) and odor discrimination scores (Tourette syndrome subjects 12.1 ± 2.1 versus healthy controls 13.2 ± 1.6; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.041) in comparison to healthy subjects, while there was no difference in odor threshold (Tourette syndrome subjects 7.3 ± 2.7 versus healthy controls 8.1 ± 2.2; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.22). Seven out of 28 Tourette syndrome subjects (25%) scored in the range of the age- and sex-dependent combined score for hyposmia, while two of 28 healthy controls (7%) had a similar low combined score. None of the participants were found to have functional anosmia. Multiple linear regression analyses suggest that social impairment may a predictor for low combined score and odor identification score in Tourette syndrome subjects (p = 0.003). Compared to healthy controls, altered olfaction in adults with Tourette syndrome was found in this study. Normal odor threshold level but lower scores at tasks involving supra-threshold odor concentrations point towards a central-nervous alteration in the processing of olfactory information in Tourette syndrome.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197598</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f3e:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25948-x</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Y.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Glucagon like-peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists diminish appetite and may contribute to the weight loss in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to determine, for the first time, the expression of GLP-1R by colon nerve fibres in patients with IBD, and functional effects of its agonists in cultured rat and human sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;GLP-1R and other nerve markers were studied by immunohistochemistry in colon biopsies from patients with IBD (n = 16) and controls (n = 8), human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissue, and in GLP-1R transfected HEK293 cells. The morphological effects of incretin hormones oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and glucagon were studied on neurite extension in cultured DRG neurons, and their functional effects on capsaicin and ATP signalling, using calcium imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significantly increased numbers of colonic mucosal nerve fibres were observed in IBD biopsies expressing GLP-1R (p = 0.0013), the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 (p = 0.0008), and sensory neuropeptide CGRP (p = 0.0014). An increase of GLP-1R positive nerve fibres in IBD colon was confirmed with a different antibody to GLP-1R (p = 0.016). GLP-1R immunostaining was intensely positive in small and medium-sized neurons in human DRG, and in human and rat DRG cultured neurons. Co-localization of GLP-1R expression with neuronal markers in colon and DRG confirmed the neural expression of GLP-1R, and antibody specificity was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with the GLP-1R. Treatment with oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and GLP-1 increased neurite length in cultured neurons compared with controls, but did not stimulate calcium influx directly, or affect capsaicin responses. However, exendin-4 significantly enhanced ATP responses in human DRG neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results show that increased GLP-1R innervation in IBD bowel could mediate enhanced visceral afferent signalling, and provide a peripheral target for therapeutic intervention. The differential effect of GLP-1R agonists on capsaicin and ATP responses in neurons suggest they may not affect pain mechanisms mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1, but may enhance the effects of purinergic agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Uma Anand</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Uma Anand, Yiangos Yiangou, Ayesha Akbar, Tom Quick, Anthony MacQuillan, Mike Fox, Marco Sinisi, Yuri E.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Glucagon like-peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists diminish appetite and may contribute to the weight loss in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to determine, for the first time, the expression of GLP-1R by colon nerve fibres in patients with IBD, and functional effects of its agonists in cultured rat and human sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;GLP-1R and other nerve markers were studied by immunohistochemistry in colon biopsies from patients with IBD (n = 16) and controls (n = 8), human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissue, and in GLP-1R transfected HEK293 cells. The morphological effects of incretin hormones oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and glucagon were studied on neurite extension in cultured DRG neurons, and their functional effects on capsaicin and ATP signalling, using calcium imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significantly increased numbers of colonic mucosal nerve fibres were observed in IBD biopsies expressing GLP-1R (p = 0.0013), the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 (p = 0.0008), and sensory neuropeptide CGRP (p = 0.0014). An increase of GLP-1R positive nerve fibres in IBD colon was confirmed with a different antibody to GLP-1R (p = 0.016). GLP-1R immunostaining was intensely positive in small and medium-sized neurons in human DRG, and in human and rat DRG cultured neurons. Co-localization of GLP-1R expression with neuronal markers in colon and DRG confirmed the neural expression of GLP-1R, and antibody specificity was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with the GLP-1R. Treatment with oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and GLP-1 increased neurite length in cultured neurons compared with controls, but did not stimulate calcium influx directly, or affect capsaicin responses. However, exendin-4 significantly enhanced ATP responses in human DRG neurons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results show that increased GLP-1R innervation in IBD bowel could mediate enhanced visceral afferent signalling, and provide a peripheral target for therapeutic intervention. The differential effect of GLP-1R agonists on capsaicin and ATP responses in neurons suggest they may not affect pain mechanisms mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1, but may enhance the effects of purinergic agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198024</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1a:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00045</originId><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId></origin><published>1526011200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00045</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00045</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Binding of Cytotoxic Aß25–35 Peptide to the Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine Lipid Bilayer</title><fingerprint>b9918632</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.8b00045/20180511/images/medium/ci-2018-00045s_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00045&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The finding of power law scaling in neural recordings lends support to the hypothesis of critical brain dynamics. However, power laws are not unique to critical systems and can arise from alternative mechanisms. Here, we investigate whether a common time-varying external drive to a set of Poisson units can give rise to neuronal avalanches and exhibit apparent criticality. To this end, we analytically derive the avalanche size and duration distributions, as well as additional measures, first for homogeneous Poisson activity, and then for slowly varying inhomogeneous Poisson activity. We show that homogeneous Poisson activity cannot give rise to power law distributions. Inhomogeneous activity can also not generate perfect power laws, but it can exhibit approximate power laws with cutoffs that are comparable to those typically observed in experiments. The mechanism of generating apparent criticality by time-varying external fields, forces or input may generalize to many other systems like dynamics of swarms, diseases or extinction cascades. Here, we illustrate the analytically derived effects for spike recordings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and discuss approaches to distinguish true from apparent criticality. Ultimately, this requires causal interventions, which allow separating internal system properties from externally imposed ones.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lb6BJ4HT6MU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527615723856</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viola Priesemann, Oren Shriki&lt;/p&gt;

Phosphoinositide (PtdInsP) lipids recruit effector proteins to membranes to mediate a variety of functions including signal transduction and membrane trafficking. Each PtdInsP binds to a specific set of effectors through characteristic protein domains such as the PH, FYVE and PX domains. Domains with high affinity for a single PtdInsP species are useful as probes to visualize the distribution and dynamics of that PtdInsP. The endolysosomal system is governed by two primary PtdInsPs: phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], which are thought to localize and control early endosomes and lysosomes/late endosomes, respectively. While PtdIns(3)P has been analysed with mammalian-derived PX and FYVE domains, PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; indicators remain controversial. Thus, complementary probes against these PtdInsPs are needed, including those originating from non-mammalian proteins. Here, we characterized in mammalian cells the dynamics of the PH domain from PH-containing protein-1 from the parasite &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; (TgPH1), which was previously shown to bind PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, we show that TgPH1 retains membrane-binding in PIKfyve-inhibited cells, suggesting that TgPH1 is not a viable PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; marker in mammalian cells. Instead, PtdIns(3)P depletion using pharmacological and enzyme-based assays dissociated TgPH1 from membranes. Indeed, TgPH1 co-localized with Rab5-positive early endosomes. In addition, TgPH1 co-localized and behaved similarly to the PX domain of p40phox and FYVE domain of EEA1, which are commonly used as PtdIns(3)P indicators. Collectively, TgPH1 offers a complementary reporter for PtdIns(3)P derived from a non-mammalian protein and that is distinct from commonly employed PX and FYVE domain-based probes.</content></content><author><name>Krishna Chintaluri</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Krishna Chintaluri, Brady D.

Collectively, TgPH1 offers a complementary reporter for PtdIns(3)P derived from a non-mammalian protein and that is distinct from commonly employed PX and FYVE domain-based probes.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198454</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bcc:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163b7dd3307:321f9cf:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7</link><title>Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle</title><fingerprint>2bee81a0</fingerprint><engagement>20</engagement><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05322-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Electronic system recreates an advanced sense of touch.</content></content><published>1527750000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic nerve flexes a cockroach’s muscle, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05322-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Electronic system recreates an advanced sense of touch.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05322-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527798117127</crawled><visual><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05322-7/d41586-018-05322-7_15805006.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05315-6</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Wolfgang Lucht</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>8</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05315-6</link><unread>True</unread><title>Planting the Anthropocene’s roots in globalization</title><fingerprint>184b6439</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Planting the Anthropocene’s roots in globalization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planting the Anthropocene’s roots in globalization, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05315-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05315-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Did the contested epoch begin in the seventeenth century?

Active learning is a pedagogical approach that involves students engaging in collaborative learning, which enables them to take more responsibility for their learning and improve their critical thinking skills. While prior research examined student performance at majority universities, this study focuses on specifically Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for the first time. Here we present work that focuses on the impact of active learning interventions at Florida A&amp;amp;M University, where we measured the impact of active learning strategies coupled with a SCALE-UP (Student Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies) learning environment on student success in General Biology. In biology sections where active learning techniques were employed, students watched online videos and completed specific activities before class covering information previously presented in a traditional lecture format. In-class activities were then carefully planned to reinforce critical concepts and enhance critical thinking skills through active learning techniques such as the one-minute paper, think-pair-share, and the utilization of clickers. Students in the active learning and control groups covered the same topics, took the same summative examinations and completed identical homework sets. In addition, the same instructor taught all of the sections included in this study. Testing demonstrated that these interventions increased learning gains by as much as 16%, and students reported an increase in their positive perceptions of active learning and biology. Overall, our results suggest that active learning approaches coupled with the SCALE-UP environment may provide an added opportunity for student success when compared with the standard modes of instruction in General Biology.</content></content><author><name>Gokhan Hacisalihoglu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gokhan Hacisalihoglu, Desmond Stephens, Lewis Johnson, Maurice Edington&lt;/p&gt;

We need all the reality checks we can get, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/423&quot;&gt;and this one&lt;/a&gt; (reported by a large multinational team led out of Oxford) uses light scattering to get more mass resolution than I would have thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light scattering by small particles depends on their refractive index and the particle volume. Proteins have basically the same refractive index (the indices of the individual amino acids don’t vary that much, and it’s all averaged out). Likewise, the volume occupied by each amino acid is very similar as well, and putting these together means that if you do very accurate light scattering measurements (using interferometry) the signal you get should be proportional to the number of amino acid residues or the total mass. This effect has been predicted, but recent improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to actually observe this and use it in real applications. The group gives the technique the deliberately memorable name of iSCAMS (interferometric scattering mass spectrometry), and we’ll have to get used to the idea of being able to do “mass spec” with a microscope and visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over a range of proteins (both monomers and larger oligomers), the team found a very good correlation (within 1.8%, plus or minus half a per cent) between the interferomic signature and protein mass, one that (importantly) was not influenced by the three-dimensional shape of the protein itself. The correlation also held for lipid nanodisc species, which is a good sign. And since I was writing just the other day about glycosylated proteins, I note that they also observed various states of a highly glycosylated (up to half the molecular weight) HIV envelope complex, and could spot the differences there as well. So it look like the effect holds for a number of different biomolecule types, although I expect that there will be refinements to the scattering models for these as the technique is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like it could be a very good technique for studying protein-protein interactions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the potential advantage of spatial resolution as well. I’m not sure if you could ever get something like this to work in a living cell (the signal/noise would be a huge problem), but there’s a lot of biomolecular behavior that you could get new details on short of that. There are a lot of variations to try, such as different surfaces, and immobilized binding partners. This could be a good complement to techniques like SPR, only this time at a single-protein level. It’ll be interesting to see if it can get to the point of delivering on- and off-rates, which is one of SPR’s great advantages. As it stands now, the resolution of iSCAMS doesn’t seem good enough to detect small-molecule binding to individual proteins, but it could certainly pick up small molecule effects on protein complexes, and presumably effects on protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-polysaccharide interactions as well. That should keep everyone occupied!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1525957661000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I’m always happy when a new analytical technique is worked out, especially one that’s applicable to biological binding assays, doesn’t require labeling of the species involved, and is orthogonal to the existing methods.

When patient similarity is defined by pathway-level gene expression, netDx identifies biological pathways important for outcome prediction, as demonstrated in diverse data sets of breast cancer and asthma. Thus, netDx can serve both as a patient classifier and as a tool for discovery of biological features characteristic of disease.

Interleukin 17 (IL-17)–producing γδ T cells (γδ17 T cells) have been recently found to promote tumor growth and metastasis formation. How such γδ17 T-cell responses may be regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we report that tumor-associated neutrophils can display an overt antitumor role by strongly suppressing γδ17 T cells. Tumor-associated neutrophils inhibited the proliferation of murine CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells via induction of oxidative stress, thereby preventing them from constituting the major source of pro-tumoral IL-17 in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that low expression of the antioxidant glutathione in CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells renders them particularly susceptible to neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistently, superoxide deficiency, or the administration of a glutathione precursor, rescued CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T-cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, human Vδ1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ T cells, which contain most γδ17 T cells found in cancer patients, also displayed low glutathione levels and were potently inhibited by ROS. This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526060763996</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Mensurado, Margarida Rei, Telma Lança, Marianna Ioannou, Natacha Gonçalves-Sousa, Hiroshi Kubo, Marie Malissen, Venizelos Papayannopoulos, Karine Serre, Bruno Silva-Santos&lt;/p&gt;

Brucellosis is essentially a disease of domesticated livestock; however, humans can also be infected via the consumption of contaminated meat or dairy products, underlying the need for rapid and accurate identification methods. Procedures for microbiological identification and typing of &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp. are expensive, time-consuming, and must be conducted in biohazard containment facilities to minimize operator risk. The development of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)-based assay has reduced the processing time while maintaining performance standards. In this study, to improve the identification accuracy and suitability of the MALDI-TOF-based assay for routine diagnosis, we developed a new protein extraction protocol and generated a custom reference database containing &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; strains representative of the most widespread species. The reference library was then challenged with blind-coded field samples isolated from infected animals. The results indicated that the database could be used to correctly identify 99.5% and 97% of &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; strains at the genus and species level, respectively, indicating that the performance of the assay was not affected by the different culture conditions used for microbial isolation. Moreover, the inactivated samples were stored and shipped to reference laboratories with no ill effect on protein stability, thus confirming the reliability of our method for routine diagnosis. Finally, we evaluated the epidemiological value of the protocol by comparing the clustering analysis results of &lt;i&gt;Brucella melitensis&lt;/i&gt; strains obtained via multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis or MALDI-TOF MS.

In practice, the positions of the Drude particles experiencing the solvent reaction field arising from the fixed charges and induced polarization of the solute must be optimized in a self‐consistent manner. Here, we parameterized the model to reproduce experimental solvation free energies of a set of small molecules. The model reproduces well‐experimental solvation free energies of 70 molecules, yielding a root mean square difference of 0.8 kcal/mol versus 2.5 kcal/mol for the CHARMM36 additive force field. The polarization work associated with the solute transfer from the gas‐phase to the polar solvent, a term neglected in the framework of additive force fields, was found to make a large contribution to the total solvation free energy, comparable to the polar solute–solvent solvation contribution. The Drude PB/SASA also reproduces well the electronic polarization from the explicit solvent simulations of a small protein, BPTI. Model validation was based on comparisons with the experimental relative binding free energies of 371 single alanine mutations. With the Drude PB/SASA model the root mean square deviation between the predicted and experimental relative binding free energies is 3.35 kcal/mol, lower than 5.11 kcal/mol computed with the CHARMM36 additive force field.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of skin antiseptic solutions (chlorhexidine-alcohol (CHG) versus povidone iodine-alcohol solution (PVI)) for the prevention of intravascular-catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in intensive care unit (ICU) in France based on an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial (CLEAN).&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;A 100-day time semi-markovian model was performed to be fitted to longitudinal individual patient data from CLEAN database. This model includes eight health states and probabilistic sensitivity analyses on cost and effectiveness were performed. Costs of intensive care unit stay are based on a French multicentre study and the cost-effectiveness criterion is the cost per patient with catheter-related bloodstream infection avoided.&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;2,349 patients (age≥18 years) were analyzed to compare the 1-time CHG group (CHG-T1, 588 patients), the 4-time CHG group (CHG-T4, 580 patients), the 1-time PVI group (PVI-T1, 587 patients), and the 4-time PVI group (PVI-T4, 594 patients).&lt;/p&gt; Intervention &lt;p&gt;2% chlorhexidine-70% isopropyl alcohol (chlorhexidine-alcohol) compared to 5% povidone iodine-69% ethanol (povidone iodine-alcohol).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean cost per alive, discharged or dead patient was of €23,798 (95% confidence interval: €20,584; €34,331), €21,822 (€18,635; €29,701), €24,874 (€21,011; €31,678), and €24,201 (€20,507; €29,136) for CHG-T1, CHG-T4, PVI-T1, and PVI-T4, respectively. The mean number of patients with CRBSI per 1000 patients was of 3.49 (0.42; 12.57), 6.82 (1.86; 17.38), 26.04 (14.64; 42.58), and 23.05 (12.32; 39.09) for CHG-T1, CHG-T4, PVI-T1, and PVI-T4, respectively. In comparison to the 1-time PVI solution, the 1-time CHG solution avoids 22.55 CRBSI /1,000 patients, and saves €1,076 per patient. This saving is not statistically significant at a 0.05 level because of the overlap of 95% confidence intervals for mean costs per patient in each group. Conversely, the difference in effectiveness between the CHG-T1 solution and the PVI-T1 solution is statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The CHG-T1 solution is more effective at the same cost than the PVI-T1 solution. CHG-T1, CHG-T4 and PVI-T4 solutions are statistically comparable for cost and effectiveness.This study is based on the data from the RCT from 11 French intensive care units registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01629550).&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Franck Maunoury</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franck Maunoury, Christian Farinetto, Stéphane Ruckly, Jeremy Guenezan, Jean-Christophe Lucet, Alain Lepape, Julien Pascal, Bertrand Souweine, Olivier Mimoz, Jean-François Timsit&lt;/p&gt;

The energy-growth nexus has important policy implications for economic development. The results from many past studies that investigated the causality direction of this nexus can lead to misleading policy guidance. Using data on China from 1953 to 2013, this study shows that an application of causality test on the time series of energy consumption and national output has masked a lot of information. The Toda-Yamamoto test with bootstrapped critical values and the newly proposed non-linear causality test reveal no causal relationship. However, a further application of these tests using series in different time-frequency domain obtained from wavelet decomposition indicates that while energy consumption Granger causes economic growth in the short run, the reverse is true in the medium term.

Q fever vaccine uptake among veterinary nurses in Australia is low, suggesting veterinarians are not recommending the vaccination to veterinary personnel. This study aimed to determine the willingness of veterinarians to recommend Q fever vaccination to veterinary personnel and to identify factors influencing Q fever vaccine uptake by veterinary nurses in Australia. An online cross sectional survey targeted veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia in 2014. Responses were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Factors significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with a willingness to recommend the vaccination, expressed by 35% (95% CI 31–38%) of veterinarians (n = 828), were (1) being very concerned for colleagues regarding &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; (OR 4.73), (2) disagreeing the vaccine is harmful (OR 3.80), (3) high Q fever knowledge (OR 2.27), (4) working within small animal practice (OR 1.67), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.55), and (6) age, with veterinarians under 39 years most likely to recommend vaccination. Of the veterinary nursing cohort who reported a known Q fever vaccination status (n = 688), 29% (95% CI 26–33%) had sought vaccination. This was significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with (1) agreeing the vaccine is important (OR 8.34), (2) moderate/high Q fever knowledge (OR 5.51), (3) working in Queensland (OR 4.00), (4) working within livestock/mixed animal practice (OR 3.24), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.86), (6) strong reliance on work culture for biosecurity information (OR 2.5), (7) perceiving personal exposure to &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; to be at least low/moderate (OR 2.14), and (8) both agreeing the vaccine is safe and working within a corporate practice structure (OR 4.28). The study identified the need for veterinarians to take greater responsibility for workplace health and safety promotion, and calls for better education of veterinary personnel to raise awareness of the potential for occupational exposure to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burnetii&lt;/i&gt; and improve the perception of the Q fever vaccine as being important, safe and cost-effective.</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emily Sellens, Jacqueline M.

Team SA involves a common perspective between two or more individuals regarding current environmental events, their meaning, and projected future status. Team SA has been theorized to be important for resuscitation team effectiveness.

Goat breeding has become an important sector in Eastern Europe, with Romania and Hungary being among the major producer countries. Given the limited number of research done up-to-date concerning genetic studies of indigenous goat breeds reared in Romania and Hungary, the current preliminary study aimed to analyze the variability of genes related to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP™). We studied 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to 19 genes in indigenous breeds from both countries, namely Banat’s White (n = 36), Carpatina (n = 35) from Romania and Hungarian Milking (n = 79) and identified 16 polymorphic SNPs among 10 genes (&lt;i&gt;PTX3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLEC4E&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNFSF13&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TLR3&lt;/i&gt;) in 150 animals. Furthermore, the diversity of the studied breeds was investigated. The PIC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.691. The mean values of observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.235 and 0.246 respectively. The highest observed heterozygosity was obtained for &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T in Banat’s White (0.464), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T in Carpatina (0.577) and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G in Hungarian Milking (0.588). Pairwise F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values between the Romanian breeds and Romanian and Hungarian breeds were small (0.009 and 0.015), indicating the close relationship among the studied goat populations. From all the polymorphic SNPs identified, the Hungarian Milking breed showed the highest proportion of polymorphisms (100%), whereas the Carpatina breed had the lowest percentage (87.5%). The highest value of MAF was obtained for &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G (0.46), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T (0.47), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10344025C&gt;T (0.45), and &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T (0.42).

Collectively, these results demonstrate that Hippo signaling defines venous pole cardiomyocyte number by modulating both the number and the identity of the ALPM cells that will populate the atrium of the heart.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29106</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><crawled>1527598755470</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163abfb2e8e:1eb8296:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5140.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Ilia Khait, Patrick Azaria, Claudius Hubig, Ulrich Schollwock, Assa Auerbach</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5140</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5140.short?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><title>Doped Kondo chain, a heavy Luttinger liquid [Physics]</title><fingerprint>c6fc1611</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The doped 1D Kondo Lattice describes complex competition between itinerant and magnetic ordering.

Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male &lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&lt;/i&gt;. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.</content></content><author><name>Ronald David MacLaren</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;

To classify different chemical bonds and especially some nonclassical interactions, a list of universal criteria has also been proposed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25214?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1639679584a:2569b3:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36861</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527811200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36861</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36861</link><title>Characterisation of molecular motions in cryo-EM single-particle data by multi-body refinement in RELION</title><fingerprint>25e20f5b</fingerprint><description>Macromolecular complexes that exhibit continuous forms of structural flexibility pose a challenge for many existing tools in cryo-EM single-particle analysis.

Background &lt;p&gt;The typical degeneration of the vertebral endplate shown in MRI imaging is Modic change.

Observe the prevalence, type and distribution characteristics of Modic changes occurred at the vertebral endplate from T10 to S1;analyse the correlation between Modic changes and disc degeneration, the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT) and pelvic incidence (PI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 928 intervertebral endplates from 58 patients, Modic changes occurred at 90 endplates (9.7%) of 30 patients (51.7%). 5 endplates (0.5%) of 3 patients (5.2%) were classified as type I, 68 endplates (7.3%) of 25 patients (43.1%) as type II, 17 endplates (1.8%) of 9 patients (15.5%) as type III. The location of the degenerative endplates: 2 (2.2%) superior and inferior endplates of L1, 3 (3.3%) inferior endplates of T11and T12, 4 (4.4%) superior endplates of L2, 6 (6.7%) inferior endplates of L2 and L4, 8 (8.9%) superior endplates of S1, 9 (10%) superior endplates of L3, 11 (12.2%) inferior endplates of L3 and L5 and superior endplates of L4, 12 (13.3%) superior endplates of L5.

Bennett&lt;/p&gt;
As the production of non-traditional export (NTX) crops by smallholder households in developing countries expands, there is a compelling need to understand the potential effects of this type of agricultural production on household food security and nutrition. We use two household surveys with a sample of 52 households, interviews, and focus groups to examine whether smallholder farmers who produce broccoli for export in a rural Guatemalan community have different household food security than farmers in the same community who are still growing traditional maize and bean crops. We explore and compare the food security status of broccoli farmers (adopters) and traditional farmers (non-adopters) across four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability. Adopters earned significantly more income (40%) than non-adopters, but higher incomes did not coincide with improvements in food availability, food access, or food utilization. Results indicate that adopters and non-adopters alike struggle with access to food, while the intensity of broccoli production may be undermining the ability of local agricultural systems to naturally control pests and regulate nutrients. More systematic approaches to food security assessment, especially those that consider all four dimensions of food security, are needed to better target interventions designed to alleviate food insecurity among rural smallholders.</content></content><author><name>Josée Méthot</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Josée Méthot, Elena M.

More systematic approaches to food security assessment, especially those that consider all four dimensions of food security, are needed to better target interventions designed to alleviate food insecurity among rural smallholders.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198113</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4ea:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1634b2fd2d5:1526271:3dd877af</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</link><title>Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain</title><fingerprint>9c388810</fingerprint><engagement>51</engagement><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain, Published online: 10 May 2018;

Background &lt;p&gt;Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transport of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) to mucosal surfaces is thought to promote gut integrity and immunity to &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Typhimurium (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt;), an invasive pathogen in mice. To elucidate potential mechanisms, we assessed intestinal barrier function and both oral and systemic S. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; virulence in pIgR knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In uninfected animals, we harvested jejunal segments for Ussing chamber analyses of transepithelial resistance (TER); mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) for bacterial culture; and serum and stool for IgA. Separately, we infected mice either orally or intravenously (IV) with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; to compare colonization, tissue dynamics, and inflammation between KOs and WTs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Uninfected KOs displayed decreased TER and dramatically increased serum IgA and decreased fecal IgA vs. WT; however, KO mLNs yielded fewer bacterial counts. Remarkably, WTs challenged orally with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; exhibited increased splenomegaly, tissue colonization, and pro-inflammatory cytokines vs. pIgR KOs, which showed increased survival following either oral or IV infection.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Absence of pIgR compromises gut integrity but does not exacerbate bacterial translocation nor &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; infection. These findings raise the possibility that immune adaptation to increased gut permeability and elevated serum IgA in the setting of SIgA deficiency provides compensatory protection against invasive gut pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Kristina J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transport of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) to mucosal surfaces is thought to promote gut integrity and immunity to &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Typhimurium (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt;), an invasive pathogen in mice. To elucidate potential mechanisms, we assessed intestinal barrier function and both oral and systemic S. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; virulence in pIgR knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In uninfected animals, we harvested jejunal segments for Ussing chamber analyses of transepithelial resistance (TER); mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) for bacterial culture; and serum and stool for IgA. Separately, we infected mice either orally or intravenously (IV) with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; to compare colonization, tissue dynamics, and inflammation between KOs and WTs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Uninfected KOs displayed decreased TER and dramatically increased serum IgA and decreased fecal IgA vs. WT; however, KO mLNs yielded fewer bacterial counts. Remarkably, WTs challenged orally with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; exhibited increased splenomegaly, tissue colonization, and pro-inflammatory cytokines vs. pIgR KOs, which showed increased survival following either oral or IV infection.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Absence of pIgR compromises gut integrity but does not exacerbate bacterial translocation nor &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; infection. These findings raise the possibility that immune adaptation to increased gut permeability and elevated serum IgA in the setting of SIgA deficiency provides compensatory protection against invasive gut pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198434</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527876013672</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf5:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332478v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Blazej, P.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/28/332478</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332478v1?rss=1</link><title>The structure of the genetic code as an optimal graph clustering problem [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>735f26c5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The standard genetic code (SGC) is the set of rules by which genetic information is translated into proteins, from codons, i.e. triplets of nucleotides, to amino acids.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;There is limited data on third-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC).

From the HIRA database, patients newly diagnosed in 2010 with MGC were identified (N = 1,871), and of these, 229 patients who had received third-line chemotherapy were finally selected for this study.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Prior to third-line chemotherapy, more than 90% of patients received fluoropyrimidine and platinum, and 43.7% and 40.6% received taxane and irinotecan, respectively. Various third-line chemotherapy regimens containing taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel), irinotecan, or oxaliplatin were prescribed. The median overall survival (OS) of all patients receiving third-line chemotherapy was 4.4 months. The median time from the start date of first-line chemotherapy to the start date of third-line chemotherapy (TF1T3) was 9.5 months, and a longer TF1T3 was the only factor that was significantly associated with an increased OS. The median OS of patients who had received fluoropyrimidine, platinum, and taxane followed by third-line irinotecan-based therapy was similar to that of patients who had received fluoropyrimidine, platinum, and irinotecan followed by third-line taxane-based therapy (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.894).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In patients with MGC receiving third-line chemotherapy, TF1T3 was the only significant factor associated with OS.

Food security has always been a focus issue in China. Farmland consolidation (FC) was regarded as a critical way to increase the quantity and improve the quality of farmland to ensure food security by Chinese government. FC projects have been nationwide launched, however few studies focused on evaluating the effectiveness of FC at a national scale. As such, an efficient way to evaluate the effectiveness of FC on improving agricultural productivity in China will be needed and it is critical for future national land consolidation planning. In this study, we selected 7505 FC projects completed between 2006 and 2013 with good quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as samples to evaluate the effectiveness of FC. We used time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI from 2001 to 2013, to extract four indicators to characterize agricultural productivity change of 4442 FC projects completed between 2006 and 2010, i.e., productivity level (PL), productivity variation (PV), productivity potential (PP), and multi-cropping index (MI). On this basis, we further predicted the same four characteristics for 3063 FC projects completed between 2011 and 2013, respectively, using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We found FC showed an overall effective status on improving agricultural productivity between 2006 and 2013 in China, especially on upgrading PL and improving PP. The positive effect was more prominent in the southeast and eastern China. It is noteworthy that 27.30% of all the 7505 projects were still ineffective on upgrading PL, the elementary improvement of agricultural productivity. Finally, we proposed that location-specific factors should be taken into consideration for launching FC projects and diverse financial sources are also needed for supporting FC. The results provide a reference for government to arrange FC projects reasonably and to formulate land consolidation planning in a proper way that better improve the effectiveness of FC.</content></content><author><name>Yeting Fan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yeting Fan, Xiaobin Jin, Xiaomin Xiang, Le Gan, Xuhong Yang, Zhihong Zhang, Yinkang Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Zinc is an essential mineral, but our understanding of its uses in the body is limited. Capitalizing on approaches available in the model system &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, Zhao and colleagues show that zinc transduces a signal that induces sperm to become motile. This is an enigmatic process because sperm in all sexually-reproducing animals are transcriptionally inactive. Zinc levels inside sperm are regulated by an evolutionarily conserved zinc transporter called Zrt- and Irt-like Protein Transporter 7.1 (ZIPT-7.1). This zinc transporter localizes to intracellular organelles, suggesting that it primarily controls zinc levels by releasing zinc into the cytoplasm from internal stores rather than importing it from the external environment. The zinc released within cells acts as a messenger in a signaling pathway to promote mobility acquisition. These studies reveal an important role for zinc as an intracellular second messenger that generates physiological changes vital for sperm motility and fertility.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XYCrK2qbn9w&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1528393441406</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana S.

In anaplastic thyroid cancer C643 cells, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) attenuates migration by activating the S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor and the Rho-ROCK pathway. In the present study, we show that stimulating C643 cells with S1P decreases the expression, secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and to a lesser extent MMP9. Using receptor-specific antagonists, and S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; siRNA, we showed that the inhibition of expression of MMP2 is mediated through S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, S1P inhibited calpain activity, and inhibiting calpain pharmacologically, inhibited the effect of S1P on MMP2 expression and activity, and on MMP9 activity. S1P treatment increased Rho activity, and by incubating cells with the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase or the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, the S1P-induced inhibition of invasion and MMP2 expression and activity was abolished. We conclude that S1P attenuates the invasion of C643 cells by activating S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the Rho-ROCK pathway, by decreasing calpain activity, and by decreasing the expression, secretion and activity of MMP2 and, to a lesser extent, MMP9.

The transcriptional network and protein regulators that govern T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation have been studied extensively using advanced genomic approaches. For a better understanding of these biological processes, we have moved a step forward, from gene- to protein-level characterization of Th17 cells. Mass spectrometry–based label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics analysis were made of in vitro differentiated murine Th17 and induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells. More than 4,000 proteins, covering almost all subcellular compartments, were detected. Quantitative comparison of the protein expression profiles resulted in the identification of proteins specifically expressed in the Th17 and iTreg cells.

The transcriptional network and protein regulators that govern T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation have been studied extensively using advanced genomic approaches. For a better understanding of these biological processes, we have moved a step forward, from gene- to protein-level characterization of Th17 cells. Mass spectrometry–based label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics analysis were made of in vitro differentiated murine Th17 and induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells. More than 4,000 proteins, covering almost all subcellular compartments, were detected. Quantitative comparison of the protein expression profiles resulted in the identification of proteins specifically expressed in the Th17 and iTreg cells. Importantly, our combined analysis of proteome and gene expression data revealed protein expression changes that were not associated with changes at the transcriptional level. Our dataset provides a valuable resource, with new insights into the proteomic characteristics of Th17 and iTreg cells, which may prove useful in developing treatment of autoimmune diseases and developing tumor immunotherapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3TAHD3yxTS4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><author><name>Imran Mohammad</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/3TAHD3yxTS4/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527789422282</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163b75886ca:c89e3:ed160cc3</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/146035v3?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>DevoWorm Group,</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/30/146035</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/146035v3?rss=1</link><title>The Emergent Connectome in Caenorhabditis elegans Embryogenesis [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>25ba39ed</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The relatively new field of connectomics provides us with a unique window into nervous system function.

In recent years, effective treatment of infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; has become challenging due to the ability of the bacterium to acquire or up-regulate antimicrobial resistance determinants. Two component signal transduction systems are known to regulate expression of virulence factors including multidrug efflux pumps. Here, we investigated the role of the AdeRS two component signal transduction system in regulating the AdeAB efflux system, determined whether AdeA and/or AdeB can individually confer antimicrobial resistance, and explored the interplay between pentamidine resistance and growth conditions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978. Results identified that deletion of &lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; affected resistance towards chlorhexidine and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, two previously defined AdeABC substrates, and also identified an 8-fold decrease in resistance to pentamidine. Examination of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt;, Δ&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and Δ&lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; cells augmented results seen for Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; and identified a set of dicationic AdeAB substrates. RNA-sequencing of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; revealed transcription of 290 genes were ≥2-fold altered compared to the wildtype. Pentamidine shock significantly increased &lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt; expression in the wildtype, but decreased it in Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt;, implying that AdeRS activates &lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; transcription in ATCC 17978. Investigation under multiple growth conditions, including the use of Biolog phenotypic microarrays, revealed resistance to pentamidine in ATCC 17978 and mutants could be altered by bioavailability of iron or utilization of different carbon sources. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions.</content></content><author><name>Felise G.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the prognosis after early MRI on clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture, hypothesising that MRI pathology is associated with more disability and that MRI pathology and high occupational mechanical hand-arm exposures are associated with slower return to work (RTW).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a follow-up study of a cohort of 469 patients, who were scanned in the period 2006 to 2010. The respondents constituted our cohort for disability analysis and the subset that was in the labour market at the time of the trauma constituted our sub-cohort for RTW analysis. Questionnaires included disability scores, job title, and lifestyle factors. Job titles were linked with a job exposure matrix to estimate occupational exposures. Register information was obtained on time until RTW. We used logistic regression analysis of disability and Cox regression analysis of time until RTW.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The proportion that responded was 53% (249/469) for the disability analysis and 59% (125/212) for the RTW analysis. The mean age at follow up was 43.5 years, the mean time since trauma was 4.8 years, 53% had injury of the dominant hand, and 54% had MRI pathology. Men constituted 43% of the cohort and 56% of the sub-cohort. MRI pathology was not associated with more disability [e.g., for a &apos;Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand&apos;-score ≥20 the odds ratio was 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.26–1.17)]. Patients without MRI pathology and with low occupational exposures were off work for an average of four weeks. Patients with MRI pathology or high occupational exposures were off work for twice as long time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;MRI pathology was not associated with more disability.

The 3D organization of chromosomes is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Many experimental and polymer modeling efforts are dedicated to deciphering the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding. Chromosomes are long and densely packed—topologically constrained—polymers. The main challenges are therefore to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate properly the multi spatio-temporal scales of such macromolecules. Here, we develop a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Accounting accurately for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density, we show that our simulation scheme not only captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system but also tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining. This strategy allows a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and to go beyond the current limitations by studying long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. We use our formalism to investigate in details the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YYb8ENLLah4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527615723856</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Surya K.

Glial cells perform numerous functions to support neuron development and function, including axon wrapping, formation of the blood brain barrier, and enhancement of synaptic transmission. We have identified a novel gene, &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt;, which functions in glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Reducing Raw levels in glia results in morphological defects in the brain and ventral nerve cord, as well as defects in neuron function, as revealed by decreased locomotion in crawling assays. Examination of the number of glia along peripheral nerves reveals a reduction in glial number upon &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. The reduced number of glia along peripheral nerves occurs as a result of decreased glial proliferation. As Raw has been shown to negatively regulate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in other developmental contexts, we examined the expression of a JNK reporter and the downstream JNK target, &lt;i&gt;matrix metalloproteinase 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;mmp1&lt;/i&gt;), and found that &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown results in increased reporter activity and Mmp1 levels. These results are consistent with previous studies showing increased Mmp levels lead to nerve cord defects similar to those observed upon &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. In addition, knockdown of &lt;i&gt;puckered&lt;/i&gt;, a negative feedback regulator of JNK signaling, also causes a decrease in glial number.

Lumbar spinal stenosis causes cauda equina and nerve root compression, resulting in neurological symptoms. Although trunk flexion during level walking may alleviate these symptoms by enabling spinal canal decompression, some patients do not use this strategy. We aimed to identify the kinetic and kinematic variables that affect trunk flexion in patients during level walking. Gait was recorded in 111 patients using a three-dimensional motion capture system and six force plates. From the data recorded, walking velocity, bilateral step length, cycle time, maximum trunk flexion angle, forward pelvic tilt angle, pelvic rotation angle, maximum and minimum joint angles, and moment and power of the lower limb were calculated. Then a step-wise multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion. The maximum hip extension angle (β = 0.416), maximum hip flexion moment (β = -0.348), and step length (β = 0.257) were identified as variables significantly affecting the trunk flexion angle. The coefficient of determination adjusted for the degree of freedom was 0.294 (p &amp;lt; 0.05).

Lumbar spinal stenosis causes cauda equina and nerve root compression, resulting in neurological symptoms. Although trunk flexion during level walking may alleviate these symptoms by enabling spinal canal decompression, some patients do not use this strategy. We aimed to identify the kinetic and kinematic variables that affect trunk flexion in patients during level walking. Gait was recorded in 111 patients using a three-dimensional motion capture system and six force plates. From the data recorded, walking velocity, bilateral step length, cycle time, maximum trunk flexion angle, forward pelvic tilt angle, pelvic rotation angle, maximum and minimum joint angles, and moment and power of the lower limb were calculated. Then a step-wise multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion. The maximum hip extension angle (β = 0.416), maximum hip flexion moment (β = -0.348), and step length (β = 0.257) were identified as variables significantly affecting the trunk flexion angle. The coefficient of determination adjusted for the degree of freedom was 0.294 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis choose one of two strategies to alleviate symptoms during walking. One strategy is gait with trunk flexion posture to increase step length and hip extension angle. The other strategy is gait with trunk upright posture to decrease step length and hip extension angle.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197228</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915a:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336446v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Li, Y.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/03/336446</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336446v1?rss=1</link><title>Using composite phenotypes to reveal heterogeneity and model SpO2 of altitude acclimatization [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>249709a4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Altitude acclimatization is the physiological process of the human body adjusting to the decreased availability of oxygen.

The faculty of language is thought to be uniquely human. Recently, it has been claimed that songbirds are able to associate meaning with sound, comparable to the way that humans do. In human language, the meaning of expressions (semantics) is dependent on a mind-internal hierarchical structure (syntax). Meaning is associated with structure through the principle of compositionality, whereby the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meaning of its constituent parts and the mode of composition. We argue that while recent experimental findings on songbird call sequences offer exciting novel insights into animal communication, despite claims to the contrary, they are quite unlike what we find in human language. There are indeed remarkable behavioral and neural parallels in auditory-vocal imitation learning between songbirds and human infants that are absent in our closest evolutionary relatives, the great apes. But so far, there is no convincing evidence of syntax-determined meaning in nonhuman animals.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iFTIxhJ_hsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Johan J.

Ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest and especially during sleep, suggesting that changes in the autonomic modulation may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher &lt;i&gt;HF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;nu&lt;/sub&gt; values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (&lt;i&gt;AUC&lt;/i&gt; = 0.92 ± 0.01; &lt;i&gt;Se&lt;/i&gt; = 0.91 ± 0.06; &lt;i&gt;Sp&lt;/i&gt; = 0.90 ± 0.05).

Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH.

I’ve ordered compounds from these folks over the years, and I’ll bet that a good number of readers here have as well. The company was particularly noted for low prices, albeit with (so I’ve heard) an occasionally idiosyncratic approach to customer service, although I never had any problems myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you have an open order with them for something, I think it’s time to search for an alternate source. The owner of the company was arrested after getting off a plane from China and charged with conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, and their warehouse was raided as well. One problem is that they were selling a variety of controlled substances (for research use only, naturally) without any of the require licensing to handle these materials. How does one even import these things as a business without such paperwork? Well, the article also says that the authorities started investigating the company when a number of shipments of plastic labware destined for Ark Pharm were seized when they turned out to also have illegal drugs inside them as well. &lt;em&gt;Update: via the comments section, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/press-release/file/1067401/download&quot;&gt;here is the criminal complaint&lt;/a&gt; that goes into details on this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’ll do it.That &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; article says that the company made nearly 30,000 shipments out of its facility during 2016, and probably leaves its readers with the impression that all of this was fentanyl &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. But that’s definitely not the case – the company had a large legitimate catalog of reagents, reference compounds, and intermediates. But apparently selling heterocycles, amines, and boronic acids wasn’t quite profitable enough, so they were heading into the higher-margin end of the chemical supply business. Bad move.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1528115074000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Once in a while we have discussions of chemical suppliers around here – but we haven’t had one like this.

Alevin is an end-to-end quantification pipeline that starts from sample-demultiplexed FASTQ files and generates gene-level counts for two popular droplet-based sequencing protocols (drop-seq [1], and 10x-chromium [2]).

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematopoietic malignancy originating from T-cell progenitors in which differentiation is blocked at early stages. Physiological expression of specific NKL homeobox genes obeys a hematopoietic NKL-code implicated in the process of lymphopoiesis while in differentiated T-cells these genes are silenced. We propose that this developmental expression pattern underlies the observation that NKL homeobox genes are the most ubiquitous group of transcription factors deregulated in T-ALL, including TLX1, TLX3, NKX2-5 and NKX3-1. Here, we describe a novel member of the NKL homeobox gene subclass, NKX3-2 (BAPX1), which is aberrantly activated in 18% of pediatric T-ALL patients analyzed while being normally expressed in developing spleen. Identification of NKX3-2 expression in T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM qualified these cells to model its deregulation and function in a leukemic context. Genomic and chromosomal analyses demonstrated normal configuration of the NKX3-2 locus at chromosome 4p15, thus excluding cytogenetic dysregulation. Comparative expression profiling analysis of NKX3-2 patient data revealed deregulated activity of BMP- and MAPK-signalling. These candidate pathways were experimentally confirmed to mediate aberrant NKX3-2 expression. We also show that homeobox gene SIX6, plus MIR17HG and GATA3 are downstream targets of NKX3-2 and plausibly contribute to the pathogenesis of this malignancy by suppressing T-cell differentiation. Finally, NKL homeobox gene NKX2-5 was activated by NKX3-2 in CCRF-CEM and by FOXG1 in PEER, representing mutually inhibitory activators of this translocated oncogene. Together, our findings reveal a novel oncogenic NKL homeobox gene subclass member which is aberrantly expressed in a large subset of T-ALL patients and participates in a deregulated gene network likely to arise in developing spleen.</content></content><author><name>Stefan Nagel</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Nagel, Corinna Meyer, Maren Kaufmann, Margarete Zaborski, Roderick A.

In the 5‐step carboxylase reaction, the substrate Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP) first binds Rubisco and undergoes enolization before binding the second substrate, CO2. Hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex is followed by CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation. However, details of the roles and protonation states of active‐site residues, and sources of protons and water, remain highly speculative. Large‐scale computations on active‐site models provide a means to better understand this complex chemical mechanism.

Alternative pathways for hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex and associated active‐site protonation networks and proton and water sources were investigated. The main findings from analysis of the resulting energetics advocate major revision to existing mechanisms such that: hydration takes place anti to the CO2; both hydration and CC bond scission require early protonation of CO2 in the RuBP.CO2 complex; CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation reactions are concerted and, effectively, there is only one stable intermediate, the C3‐gemdiolate complex.

Aim &lt;p&gt;To assess the effects of differential exposure to antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) on short- and long-term outcomes of infants born before 24 weeks of gestation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective cohort study of 147 infants delivered by 116 women at 21–23 weeks of gestation between January 2001 and December 2016 at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, Korea. Eligible subjects were categorized into the following three groups according to ACS exposure: non-user (n = 53), partial-course (n = 44), and complete-course (n = 50). Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidities including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and neurodevelopmental impairment including cerebral palsy among the three groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Neonatal mortality rate was significantly lower in the ACS-user groups (non-user, 52.8%; partial-course, 27.3%; complete-course, 28.0%; P = 0.01), but complete-course of ACS therapy had no advantages over partial-course. A lower incidence of IVH was observed in the complete-course group (non-users, 54.8%; partial-course, 48.6%; complete-course, 20.5%; P = 0.003). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ACS therapy, either partial- or complete-course, was associated with a lower rate of neonatal mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.375; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.141–0.996 in partial-course; aOR 0.173; 95% CI 0.052–0.574) in complete-course). IVH (aOR 0.191; 95% CI 0.071–0.516) was less likely to occur in the complete-course group than in the non-user group.

The evaluation of protected area networks on their capacity to preserve species distributions is a key topic in conservation biology. There are different types of protected areas, with National Parks those with highest level of protection. National Parks can be declared attending to many ecological features that include the presence of certain animal species. Here, we selected 37 vertebrate species that were highlighted as having relevant natural value for at least one of the 10 National Parks of mainland Spain. We modelled species distributions with the favourability function, and applied the Insecurity Index to detect the degree of protection of favourable areas for each species. Two metrics of Insecurity Index were defined for each species: the Insecurity Index in each of the cells, and the Overall Insecurity Index of a species. The former allows the identification of insecure areas for each species that can be used to establish spatial conservation priorities. The latter gives a value of Insecurity for each species, which we used to calculate the Representativeness of favourable areas for the species in the network. As expected, due to the limited extension of the National Park network, all species have high values of Insecurity; i.e., just a narrow proportion of their favourable areas are covered by a National Park. However, the majority of species favourable areas are well represented in the network, i.e., the percentage of favourable areas covered by the National Park network is higher than the percentage of mainland Spain covered by the network (result also supported by a randomization approach). Even if a reserve network only covers a low percentage of a country, the Overall Insecurity Index allows an objective assessment of its capacity to represent species. Beyond the results presented here, the Insecurity Index has the potential to be extrapolated to other areas and to cover a wide range of species.</content></content><author><name>Alba Estrada</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alba Estrada, Raimundo Real&lt;/p&gt;

Computational approaches will be essential to synthesize the complex role of promiscuous activities in applied biotechnology and in models of evolutionary adaptation.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/310946v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527018362447</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1638963164f:7024851:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0036-4</originId><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Margherita Norelli</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>533</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0036-4/MediaObjects/41591_2018_36_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><engagement>30</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0036-4</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0036-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Monocyte-derived IL-1 and IL-6 are differentially required for cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity due to CAR T cells</title><fingerprint>eb40906e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monocyte-derived IL-1 and IL-6 are differentially required for cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity due to CAR T cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monocyte-derived IL-1 and IL-6 are differentially required for cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity due to CAR T cells, Published online: 28 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0036-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0036-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;IL-1 blockade prevents cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity by CAR T cells.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/iZPShsBDekg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1527490800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monocyte-derived IL-1 and IL-6 are differentially required for cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity due to CAR T cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monocyte-derived IL-1 and IL-6 are differentially required for cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity due to CAR T cells, Published online: 28 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0036-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0036-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;IL-1 blockade prevents cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity by CAR T cells.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/iZPShsBDekg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/iZPShsBDekg/s41591-018-0036-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527520035470</crawled><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_163a74a028e:1847862:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5878.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Rui Hao, Yunshan Fan, Marco D.

We used HITS-CLIP to define ZFP36 targets in mouse T cells, revealing unanticipated actions in regulating T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions.

Over the last decades, the treatment of schizophrenia has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. In this study, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on social cognitive and nonsocial neurocognitive functions, as well as on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, in individuals with schizophrenia. Thirty-seven individuals with schizophrenia were administered one of three different tDCS conditions (cathodal, anodal, and sham) per visit over the course of three visits, with approximately one week between each visit. Order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. For the active conditions, the electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the reference electrode over right supraorbital cortex. Current intensity was 2 mA and was maintained for two 20-minute sessions, with a one hour break between the sessions. Assessments were conducted immediately following each session, in a counterbalanced order of administration. No systematic effects were found across the social and nonsocial cognitive domains, and no significant effects were detected on event-related potentials (ERPs). The very small effect sizes, further validated by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; power analyses (large Critical Ns), demonstrated that these findings were not due to lack of statistical power. Except for mild local discomfort, no significant side effects were reported. Findings demonstrate the safety and ease of administration of this procedure, but suggest that a single dose of tDCS over these areas does not yield a therapeutic effect on cognition in schizophrenia.

Perinatal depression is common, and left untreated can have significant and long-lasting consequences for women, their children and their families. Migrant women are at particular risk of perinatal depression as a result of a multitude of stressors experienced before, during and after migration. Identification of perinatal depression among migrant women—particularly those living in low- and middle-income regions—remains challenging, partly due to the lack of locally-validated and culturally appropriate screens tools. This study formally validates Burmese and Sgaw Karen versions of the &lt;i&gt;Refugee Health Screener-15&lt;/i&gt; (RHS-15) as a screening tool for perinatal depression among migrant women living on the Thai-Myanmar border. The &lt;i&gt;Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of DSM-IV Disorders&lt;/i&gt; (SCID) was used as the gold-standard comparator. Complete results were obtained for 235 Burmese-speaking and 275 Sgaw Karen-speaking women. Despite displaying reasonable psychometric properties, a number of shortcomings associated with the RHS-15 limited its utility in this setting. The Likert-type response categories of the RHS-15 proved problematic in this low-literacy population. Combined with the relative superiority and greater ease of administration of the SCID, the RHS-15 is not recommended as the tool of choice for detecting perinatal depression in this setting.</content></content><author><name>Gracia Fellmeth</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gracia Fellmeth, Emma Plugge, Mina Fazel, Prakaykaew Charunwattana, François Nosten, Raymond Fitzpatrick, Julie A.

Immunogenicity is a major concern in drug development as anti-drug antibodies in many cases affect both patient safety and drug efficacy. Another concern is often the limited half-life of drugs, which can be altered by different chemical modifications, like acylation with fatty acids. However, acylation with fatty acids has been shown in some cases to modulate T cell activation. Therefore, to understand the role of acylation with fatty acids on immunogenicity we tested three immunogenic non-acylated peptides and 14 of their acylated analogues for binding to 26 common HLA class II alleles, and their ability to activate T cells in an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; T cell assay. Changes in binding affinity associated with acylation with fatty acids were typically modest, though a significant decrease was observed for influenza HA acylated with a stearic acid, and affinities for DQ alleles were consistently increased. Importantly, we showed that for all three immunogenic peptides acylation with fatty acids decreased their capacity to activate T cells, a trend particularly evident with longer fatty acids typically positioned within the peptide HLA class II binding core region, or when closer to the C-terminus. With these results we have demonstrated that acylation with fatty acids of immunogenic peptides can lower their stimulatory capacity, which could be important knowledge for drug design and immunogenicity mitigation.</content></content><author><name>Heidi S.

Background &lt;p&gt;To accommodate training for unilaterally affected patients (e.g. stroke), the Lokomat (a popular robotic exoskeleton-based gait trainer) provides the possibility to set the amount of movement guidance for each leg independently. Given the interlimb couplings, such asymmetrical settings may result in complex effects, in which ipsilateral activity co-depends on the amount of guidance offered to the contralateral leg. To test this idea, the effect of asymmetrical guidance on muscle activity was explored.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;15 healthy participants walked in the Lokomat at two speeds (1 and 2 km/h) and guidance levels (30% and 100%), during symmetrical (both legs receiving 30% or 100% guidance) and asymmetrical conditions (one leg receiving 30% and the other 100% guidance) resulting in eight unique conditions. Activity of the right leg was recorded from Erector Spinae, Gluteus Medius, Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris, Medial Gastrocnemius and Tibialis Anterior. Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to assess whether ipsilateral muscle activity depended on guidance settings for the contralateral leg.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Muscle output amplitude not only depended on ipsilateral guidance settings, but also on the amount of guidance provided to the contralateral leg. More specifically, when the contralateral leg received less guidance, ipsilateral activity of Gluteus Medius and Medial Gastrocnemius increased during stance. Conversely, when the contralateral leg received more guidance, ipsilateral muscle activity for these muscles decreased. These effects were specifically observed at 1 km/h, but not at 2 km/h.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study of asymmetrical guidance on muscle activity in the Lokomat, which shows that ipsilateral activity co-depends on the amount of contralateral guidance. In therapy, these properties may be exploited e.g. to promote active contributions by the more affected leg. Therefore, the present results urge further research on the use of asymmetrical guidance in patient groups targeted by Lokomat training.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Sylvana Weiland</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sylvana Weiland, Ineke H.

In proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), rare platinum metal catalyzes today the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while iron(cobalt)-nitrogen-carbon materials (Fe(Co)-N-C) are a promising alternative.

We reveal that exposure to H2O2 leaves iron-based catalytic sites untouched but decreases their turnover frequency (TOF) via oxidation of the carbon surface, leading to weakened O2 binding on iron-based sites. Their TOF is recovered upon electrochemical reduction of the carbon surface, demonstrating the proposed deactivation mechanism. Our results reveal a hitherto unsuspected deactivation mechanism during ORR in acidic medium. This study identifies the N-doped carbon surface as Achilles&apos; heel during ORR catalysis in PEMFCs. Observed in acidic but not in alkaline electrolyte, these insights suggest that durable iron-nitrogen-carbon catalysts are within reach for PEMFCs if rational strategies minimizing the amount of H2O2 or reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during ORR are developed.</description><published>1527033600000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Fuel cells efficiently convert chemical into electric energy, with promising application for clean transportation.

Observed in acidic but not in alkaline electrolyte, these insights suggest that durable iron-nitrogen-carbon catalysts are within reach for PEMFCs if rational strategies minimizing the amount of H2O2 or reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during ORR are developed.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Achilles_heel_of_Iron-Based_Catalysts_During_Oxygen_Reduction_in_Acidic_Medium/6304460</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527082862866</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1638d3b4912:75f58ad:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04261-1</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Yuanyuan Chen</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04261-1</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04261-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>A novel small molecule chaperone of rod opsin and its potential therapy for retinal degeneration</title><fingerprint>ee352808</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel small molecule chaperone of rod opsin and its potential therapy for retinal degeneration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel small molecule chaperone of rod opsin and its potential therapy for retinal degeneration, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04261-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04261-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mutations that lead to misfolding of rhodopsin can cause retinitis pigmentosa.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the nationwide seasonal peaks, risk factors, and utilization of medical resources of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;A Taiwan nationwide birth cohort was extracted from the Birth Certificate Application Database during 2007–2009 and prospectively linked to the National Health Insurance database. We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29–35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants without BPD born at &amp;lt; 32 wGA had higher RSVH rate than those born at 33–35 wGA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Overall, 56.4% of RSVH occurred within 9 months of CA. Preterm infants with BPD had significantly higher ICU admission rate within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), MV usage within 12 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and LOS within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) than those without BPD.

Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancer-related skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq.</content></content><author><name>Juan Manuel Gálvez</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Manuel Gálvez, Daniel Castillo, Luis Javier Herrera, Belén San Román, Olga Valenzuela, Francisco Manuel Ortuño, Ignacio Rojas&lt;/p&gt;

We propose an optoelectronic system for stimulation of living neurons. The system consists of an electronic circuit based on the FitzHugh–Nagumo model, an optical fiber, and a photoelectrical converter. We used this system for electrical stimulation of hippocampal living neurons in acute hippocampal brain slices (350-μm thick) obtained from a 20–28 days old C57BL/6 mouse or a Wistar rat. The main advantage of our system over other similar stimulators is that it contains an optical fiber for signal transmission instead of metallic wires. The fiber is placed between the electronic circuit and stimulated neurons and provides galvanic isolation from external electrical and magnetic fields. The use of the optical fiber allows avoiding electromagnetic noise and current flows which could affect metallic wires. Furthermore, it gives us the possibility to simulate “synaptic plasticity” by adaptive signal transfer through optical fiber. The proposed optoelectronic system (hybrid neural circuit) provides a very high efficiency in stimulating hippocampus neurons and can be used for restoring brain activity in particular regions or replacing brain parts (neuroprosthetics) damaged due to a trauma or neurodegenerative diseases.</content></content><author><name>Mikhail A.

The proposed optoelectronic system (hybrid neural circuit) provides a very high efficiency in stimulating hippocampus neurons and can be used for restoring brain activity in particular regions or replacing brain parts (neuroprosthetics) damaged due to a trauma or neurodegenerative diseases.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198396</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8454e:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324186v3?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Tokuoka, Y.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/01/324186</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324186v3?rss=1</link><title>Convolutional Neural Network-Based Instance Segmentation Algorithm to Acquire Quantitative Criteria of Early Mouse Development [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>f7bcb518</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>In embryology, image processing methods such as segmentation are applied to acquiring quantitative criteria from time-series three-dimensional microscopic images.

To examine the origin of seizures induced by severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, The EEG characteristics of seizures were analyzed in newborns with and without severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the specificity. In total, 931 patients had a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level of 340–425 μmol/L, only 2 of whom had seizures. Compared to patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a TSB level of 340–425 μmol/L, those with a TSB level &gt;425 μmol/L had a significant risk of seizure (OR = 213.2, 95% CI = 113.0–405.8, P&amp;lt;0.001). Of all 28 patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia and seizure, 26 had seizures that originated in the temporal and/or occipital lobe. In seizure patients without severe hyperbilirubinemia, origination in the temporal/occipital and other lobes occurred in 19 and 117 cases, respectively. Compared to the risk of seizure origination in the temporal and/or occipital lobe in other diseases, the risk in patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia was increased by approximately 80 times (OR = 80.1, 95% CI = 28.3–226.4, P&amp;lt;0.001). Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia can selectively induce temporal and occipital lobe seizures. This is the first report of a new syndrome with the same etiology and electrophysiological features as epilepsy.</content></content><author><name>Lian Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The balance between synthesis and degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix is severely altered in osteoarthritis, where degradation predominates. One reason for this imbalance is believed to be due to the ligation of the α5β1 integrin, the classic fibronectin (FN) receptor, with soluble FN fragments instead of insoluble FN fibrils, which induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. Our objective was to determine whether the lack of α5β1-FN binding influences cartilage morphogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and whether non-ligated α5β1 protects or aggravates the course of osteoarthritis in mice. We engineered mice (&lt;i&gt;Col2a-Cre;Fn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RGE/fl&lt;/sup&gt;), whose chondrocytes express an α5β1 binding-deficient FN, by substituting the aspartic acid of the RGD cell-binding motif with a glutamic acid (FN-RGE). At an age of 5 months the knee joints were stressed either by forced exercise (moderate mechanical load) or by partially resecting the meniscus followed by forced exercise (high mechanical load). Sections of femoral articular knees were analysed by Safranin-O staining and by immunofluorescence to determine tissue morphology, extracellular matrix proteins and matrix metalloproteinase expression. The articular cartilage from untrained control and &lt;i&gt;Col2a-Cre;Fn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RGE/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice was normal, while the exposure to high mechanical load induced osteoarthritis characterized by proteoglycan and collagen type II loss. In the &lt;i&gt;Col2a-Cre;Fn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RGE/fl&lt;/sup&gt; articular cartilage osteoarthritis progressed significantly faster than in wild type mice. Mechanistically, we observed increased expression of MMP-13 and MMP-3 metalloproteinases in FN-RGE expressing articular cartilage, which severely affected matrix remodelling.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke unless treated with an anticoagulant. Detecting AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aims of this study were to develop a screening model to detect AF in a primary healthcare setting and to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study. All 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary healthcare center in Stockholm were invited to participate in AF screening upon visiting the center during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the center during this period were invited to participate by letter. Thirty-second intermittent ECG recordings were made twice a day using a handheld Zenicor device over a 2-week period in participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of the 415 eligible individuals, a total of 324 (78.1%) patients participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score of the participants was 3. In the target population, 34 (8.2%) individuals had previously diagnosed AF. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Oral anticoagulant therapy was successfully initiated in 88% of these patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The AF screening project exhibited a high participation rate and resulted in a high rate of newly discovered AF; of these newly diagnosed patients, 88% could be treated with an oral anticoagulant.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Faris Ghazal</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Faris Ghazal, Holger Theobald, Mårten Rosenqvist, Faris Al-Khalili&lt;/p&gt;

Biodiversity loss in riparian forests has the potential to alter rates of leaf litter decomposition in stream ecosystems. However, studies have reported the full range of positive, negative and no effects of plant diversity loss on decomposition, and there is currently no explanation for such inconsistent results. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether plant diversity loss affects other ecological processes related to decomposition, such as fine particulate organic matter production or detritivore growth, which precludes a thorough understanding of how detrital stream food webs are impacted by plant diversity loss. We used a microcosm experiment to examine the effects of plant diversity loss on litter decomposition, fine particulate organic matter production, and growth of a dominant leaf-shredding detritivore, using litter mixtures varying in species composition. We hypothesized that plant diversity loss would decrease the rates of all studied processes, but such effects would depend on the leaf traits present in litter mixtures (both their average values and their variability). Our findings partly supported our hypotheses, showing that plant diversity loss had a consistently negative effect on litter decomposition and fine particulate organic matter production (but not on detritivore growth) across litter mixtures, which was mediated by detritivores. Importantly, the magnitude of the diversity effect and the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying this effect (i.e., complementarity vs. selection) varied depending on the species composition of litter mixtures, mainly because of differences in litter nutritional quality and trait variability. Complementarity was prevalent but varied in size, with positive selection effects also occurring in some mixtures. Our results support the notion that loss of riparian plant species is detrimental to key stream ecosystem processes that drive detrital food webs, but that the magnitude of such effects largely depends on the the order of species loss.</content></content><author><name>Naiara López-Rojo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naiara López-Rojo, Aingeru Martínez, Javier Pérez, Ana Basaguren, Jesús Pozo, Luz Boyero&lt;/p&gt;

Newcastle disease (ND) causes severe economic loss to poultry industry worldwide. Frequent outbreaks of ND in commercial chickens vaccinated with live vaccines suggest a need to develop improved vaccines that are genetically matched against circulating Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains. In this study, the fusion protein cleavage site (FPCS) sequence of NDV strain Banjarmasin/010 (Banj), a genotype VII NDV, was individually modified using primer mutagenesis to those of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes 2, 7 and 8 and compared with the recombinant Banjarmasin (rBanj) with avirulent NDV LaSota cleavage site (rBanj-LaSota). These FPCS mutations changed the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell-to-cell fusion activity and made rBanj FPCS mutant viruses highly attenuated in chickens. When chickens immunized with the rBanj FPCS mutant viruses and challenged with the virulent Banj, there was reduced challenge virus shedding observed compared to chickens immunized with the heterologous vaccine strain LaSota. Among the genotype VII NDV Banj vaccine candidates, rBanj-LaSota and rBanj containing FPCS of APMV-8 induced highest neutralizing antibody titers and protected chickens with reduced challenge virus shedding. These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines.</content></content><author><name>Vinoth K.

Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish (&lt;i&gt;Gambusia affinis&lt;/i&gt;) as our study organism, we characterized focal individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals’ choosiness across mate choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits.

However, these techniques rarely take advantage of existing domain-specific resources, such as ontologies. In Life and Health Sciences there is a vast and valuable set of such resources publicly available, which are continuously being updated. Biomedical ontologies are nowadays a mainstream approach to formalize existing knowledge about entities, such as genes, chemicals, phenotypes, and disorders. These resources contain supplementary information that may not be yet encoded in training data, particularly in domains with limited labeled data. We propose a new model, BO-LSTM, that takes advantage of domain-specific ontologies, by representing each entity as the sequence of its ancestors in the ontology. We implemented BO-LSTM as a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units and using an open biomedical ontology, which in our case-study was Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI).

However, these techniques rarely take advantage of existing domain-specific resources, such as ontologies. In Life and Health Sciences there is a vast and valuable set of such resources publicly available, which are continuously being updated. Biomedical ontologies are nowadays a mainstream approach to formalize existing knowledge about entities, such as genes, chemicals, phenotypes, and disorders. These resources contain supplementary information that may not be yet encoded in training data, particularly in domains with limited labeled data. We propose a new model, BO-LSTM, that takes advantage of domain-specific ontologies, by representing each entity as the sequence of its ancestors in the ontology. We implemented BO-LSTM as a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units and using an open biomedical ontology, which in our case-study was Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI). We assessed the performance of BO-LSTM on detecting and classifying drug-drug interactions in a publicly available corpus from an international challenge, composed of 792 drug descriptions and 233 scientific abstracts. By using the domain-specific ontology in addition to word embeddings and WordNet, BO-LSTM improved both the F1-score of the detection and classification of drug-drug interactions, particularly in a document set with a limited number of annotations. Our findings demonstrate that besides the high performance of current deep learning techniques, domain-specific ontologies can still be useful to mitigate the lack of labeled data.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336719v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527857174073</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163bb625639:3864a6f:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327775v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Patel, B.

Adult stem cells are considered multipotent, restricted to differentiate into a few tissue-specific cell types. With the advent of technologies which can dedifferentiate and transdifferentiate cell types, assumptions about the process of cell fate determination must be reconsidered, including the role of extrinsic versus intrinsic factors. To determine the plasticity of adult neural progenitors, rat hippocampal progenitor cells were xenotransplanted into embryonic zebrafish. These animals allow for easy detection of transplanted cells due to their external development and transparency at early stages. Adult neural progenitors were observed throughout the zebrafish for the duration of the experiment (at least five days post-transplantation). While the majority of transplanted cells were observed in the central nervous system, a large percentage of cells were located in superficial tissues. However, approximately one-third of these cells retained neural morphology and expression of the neuronal marker, Class III β-tubulin, indicating that the transplanted adult neural progenitors did not adapt alternate fates. A very small subset of cells demonstrated unique, non-neural flattened morphology, suggesting that adult neural progenitors may exhibit plasticity in this model, though at a very low rate. These findings demonstrate that the developing zebrafish may be an efficient model to explore plasticity of a variety of adult stem cell types and the role of external factors on cell fate.</content></content><author><name>Elizabeth J.

A new labeling reagent for vitamin analysis, 2-amino-10-ethyl acridine ketone (AEAO), has been synthesized and successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples. The reaction of AEAO with vitamins could proceed easily and quickly in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) as condensing reagent within 45 min. The derivatives exhibited excellent fluorescence property with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 430 nm, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to the optimization of pre-column derivatization. Solid phase extraction with HLB cartridges was used for the extraction and purification of water-soluble vitamins in tea samples. The LODs for vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 were 2.56 and 2.22 ng mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

Prepartum supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) may influence lipolysis and hyperketonemia in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of prepartum CLA supplementation on lactation performance and serum fatty acids (FA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in early lactation dairy cows, and secondarily on reproductive performance. Multiparous cows were enrolled in the study at 18 days prior to expected calving date, and randomly assigned 100 g/day of Lutrell Pure (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; 75% FA), providing 10 g/day of each CLA isomer (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-10 &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-12 and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-9 &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-11 CLA) or equivalent amount of rumen inert fatty acids as control (78 g/day of Energy Booster 100; Milk Specialties Global, Eden Prairie, MN). Treatments were top dressed daily to individual cows from enrollment to calving and all cows were offered the same ration. Blood samples were collected on the first day of supplementation, 10 days prepartum, and 1, 7, 14, and 30 days postpartum. Hyperketonemia was defined as serum BHB ≥ 1.2 mM. Milk yield was recorded daily until 60 days postpartum and averaged weekly. Milk samples were obtained weekly for component analysis. Prepartum CLA supplementation tended to increase serum concentration of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and increased trans-10, cis-12 CLA prepartum. Cows supplemented with CLA had increased milk protein yield and tended to have increased milk fat yield and milk yield, which together resulted in greater energy content of milk. Cows supplemented with CLA had lower serum FA on day 1 and 7 postpartum and overall lower serum BHB postpartum, which resulted in decreased prevalence of hyperketonemia on day 14 postpartum. There were no differences in body condition score change, other health disorders, or reproductive outcomes by treatment. Together, these findings indicate that prepartum CLA supplementation may be a plausible strategy to positively influence postpartum performance.</content></content><author><name>Rafael Caputo Oliveira</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Caputo Oliveira, Ryan S.

Nationwide, 34 million hours of cross-partisan Thanksgiving dinner discourse were lost in 2016 owing to partisan effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/1020?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Economics, Sociology</item></keywords><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d0994:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00588</originId><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId></origin><published>1525665600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00588</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00588</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Cationic Effect on the Equilibria and Kinetics of the Excited-State Proton Transfer Reaction of a Photoacid in Aqueous Solutions</title><fingerprint>d45ab91f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00588/20180507/images/medium/jp-2018-00588t_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00588&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH.

Qian, Erol Akçay&lt;/p&gt;
Niche construction theory states that not only does the environment act on populations to generate Darwinian selection, but organisms reciprocally modify the environment and the sources of natural selection. Cancer cells participate in niche construction as they alter their microenvironments and create pre-metastatic niches; in fact, metastasis is a product of niche construction. Here, we present a mathematical model of niche construction and metastasis. Our model contains producers, which pay a cost to contribute to niche construction that benefits all tumor cells, and cheaters, which reap the benefits without paying the cost. We derive expressions for the conditions necessary for metastasis, showing that the establishment of a mutant lineage that promotes metastasis depends on niche construction specificity and strength of interclonal competition. We identify a tension between the arrival and invasion of metastasis-promoting mutants, where tumors composed only of cheaters remain small but are susceptible to invasion whereas larger tumors containing producers may be unable to facilitate metastasis depending on the level of niche construction specificity. Our results indicate that even if metastatic subclones arise through mutation, metastasis may be hindered by interclonal competition, providing a potential explanation for recent surprising findings that most metastases are derived from early mutants in primary tumors.</content></content><author><name>Jimmy J.

Our results indicate that even if metastatic subclones arise through mutation, metastasis may be hindered by interclonal competition, providing a potential explanation for recent surprising findings that most metastases are derived from early mutants in primary tumors.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198163</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c26:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04457-5</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Martin Thunemann</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>461</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04457-5/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4457_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><engagement>113</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04457-5</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04457-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Deep 2-photon imaging and artifact-free optogenetics through transparent graphene microelectrode arrays</title><fingerprint>6e3ffb8a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deep 2-photon imaging and artifact-free optogenetics through transparent graphene microelectrode arrays&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep 2-photon imaging and artifact-free optogenetics through transparent graphene microelectrode arrays, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04457-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04457-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Optical imaging and manipulation technologies cannot be easily integrated with electrical recordings due to generation of light-induced artifacts.

A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate and improve the “late-night dining” options in a university dining hall. Surveys assessed student desires for late-night offerings, and evaluated students’ habits and motivations during late-night dining. Two interventions were implemented to see if students could be “nudged” into different choice patterns. In the first, a “veggie-heavy” entrée was added at the beginning of the entrée line, so that students would substitute an entrée containing vegetables for the alternatives. In the second, a snack-food bar was set up to cater to students who didn’t want to stand in the long entrée line, and preferred a snack. Data on food choice was collected during the interventions. Survey responses showed significant differences in the reasons females and males utilized late-night dining (p&amp;lt;0.001). We also found that students at late-night dining had a lower emphasis on health than the general student population. Even students at late-night who reported being health-conscious showed no difference in food selections from students who said health was not important (p = 0.883). Veggie-heavy entrées had mild success in increasing vegetable selection. However, veggie-heavy entrées were largely ignored when the other option was chicken nuggets. The snack bar was very popular. Entrée placement and convenience lines may have mild impacts on food selection in a late-night dining environment.</content></content><author><name>Samuel Bevet</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Bevet, Meredith T.

Personality traits are related to many aspects of one’s life, including risk taking, sociability, and behavioral changes caused by psychoactive substances. This study aimed to investigate individual differences and behavioral changes due to alcohol exposure in zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;). To that end, adult animals were separated into two behavioral profiles: bold and shy, according to their risk taking behavior in an emergence test. Bold and shy fish were allowed to explore a 5-chamber tank and were tested for exploration and sociability (shoaling behavior) following alcohol exposure. The acute drug exposure treatments were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.5% (v/v%) alcohol. The behavioral parameters evaluated were average and maximum swimming speed, total distance traveled, total time spent immobile, and time spent near a shoal or exploring the tank. For the groups that received no alcohol (0.0% alcohol), shy individuals spent more time near the shoal than bold fish. However, 0.5% alcohol increased bold fish responsiveness to the shoal, while both 0.1% and 0.5% alcohol diminished shoaling in shy fish. Our results show that the behavioral profiles of zebrafish are affected differently by alcohol, with shy animals seemingly more sensitive to behavioral change due to drug exposure. Moreover, we confirm zebrafish as a model for alcohol induced functional (exploration and social behavior) changes that could be useful in high throughput drug screens.</content></content><author><name>Heloysa Araujo-Silva</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Heloysa Araujo-Silva, Jaquelinne Pinheiro-da-Silva, Priscila F.

Co-expression of MCTs with various CAII mutants in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes demonstrated that CAII facilitates MCT transport activity in a process involving CAII-Glu69 and CAII-Asp72, which could function as surface proton antennae for the enzyme.

Taro, &lt;i&gt;Colocasia esculenta&lt;/i&gt; (L.) Schott, is a vegetable and starchy root crop cultivated in Asia, Oceania, the Americas, Africa, and the Mediterranean. Very little is known about its early history in the Mediterranean, which previous authors have sought to trace through Classical (Greek and Latin) texts that record the name &lt;i&gt;colocasia&lt;/i&gt; (including cognates) from the 3rd century BC onwards. In ancient literature, however, this name also refers to the sacred lotus, &lt;i&gt;Nelumbo nucifera&lt;/i&gt; Gaertn. and its edible rhizome. Like taro, lotus is an alien introduction to the Mediterranean, and there has been considerable confusion regarding the true identity of plants referred to as &lt;i&gt;colocasia&lt;/i&gt; in ancient literature. Another early name used to indicate taro was &lt;i&gt;arum&lt;/i&gt;, a name already attested from the 4th century BC. Today, this name refers to &lt;i&gt;Arum&lt;/i&gt;, an aroid genus native to West Asia, Europe, and the Mediterranean. Our aim is to explore historical references to taro in order to clarify when and through which routes this plant reached the Mediterranean. To investigate Greek and Latin texts, we performed a search using the &lt;i&gt;Thesaurus Linguae Graecae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TLG&lt;/i&gt;) and the &lt;i&gt;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TLL&lt;/i&gt;), plus commentaries and English and French translations of original texts. Results show that while in the early Greek and Latin literature the name &lt;i&gt;kolokasia&lt;/i&gt; (Greek κολοκάσια) and its Latin equivalent &lt;i&gt;colocasia&lt;/i&gt; refer to &lt;i&gt;Nelumbo nucifera&lt;/i&gt; Gaertn., after the 4th century AD a poorly understood linguistic shift occurs, and &lt;i&gt;colocasia&lt;/i&gt; becomes the name for taro. We also found that &lt;i&gt;aron&lt;/i&gt; (Greek ἄρον) and its Latin equivalent &lt;i&gt;arum&lt;/i&gt; are names used to indicate taro from the 3rd century BC and possibly earlier.</content></content><author><name>Ilaria Maria Grimaldi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ilaria Maria Grimaldi, Sureshkumar Muthukumaran, Giulia Tozzi, Antonino Nastasi, Nicole Boivin, Peter J.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise training with modest or greater weight loss (≥3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) on insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein concentrations, and lipoprotein particle size in overweight and obese participants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Adults (N = 163, body mass index: 25–37 [kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]) participated in 8 months of exercise training. Insulin sensitivity, lipid concentrations, lipid particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) following the intervention.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute insulin response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p&amp;lt;0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional lipid risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size). Clinicians should advocate patients who are overweight/obese to exercise and obtain modest weight loss for improved cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Damon L.

The insect-transmitted protozoan parasite &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; experiences changes in nutrient availability and rate of flux through different metabolic pathways across its life cycle. The species encompasses much genetic diversity of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes among isolated strains. The genetic or expression variation of both genomes are likely to impact metabolic responses to environmental stimuli, and even steady state metabolic function, among strains. To begin formal characterization these differences, we compared aspects of metabolism between genetically similar strains CL Brener and Tulahuen with less similar Esmeraldo and Sylvio X10 strains in a culture environment. Epimastigotes of all strains took up glucose at similar rates. However, the degree of medium acidification that could be observed when glucose was absent from the medium varied by strain, indicating potential differences in excreted metabolic byproducts. Our main focus was differences related to electron transport chain function. We observed differences in ATP-coupled respiration and maximal respiratory capacity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial morphology between strains, despite the fact that abundances of two nuclear-encoded proteins of the electron transport chain are similar between strains. RNA sequencing reveals strain-specific differences in abundances of mRNAs encoding proteins of the respiratory chain but also other metabolic processes. From these differences in metabolism and mitochondrial phenotypes we have generated tentative models for the differential metabolic fluxes or differences in gene expression that may underlie these results.</content></content><author><name>Murat C.

A human induced pluripotent stem cell line (GPCCi001-A) created by our group was differentiated towards chondrocyte-like cells (ChiPS) via monolayer culturing with growth factors. ChiPS are promising because they have the potential to be used in tissue engineering to regenerate articular cartilage. However, their safety must be confirmed before they can be routinely used in regenerative medicine. Using microarray analysis, we compared the ChiPS to both GPCCi001-A cells and chondrocytes. The analysis showed that, compared to both GPCCi001-A cells and chondrocytes, the expression of genes engaged in DNA damage and in the tumor protein p53 signalling pathways was significantly higher in the ChiPS. The significant amount of DNA double strand breaks and increased DNA damage response may lead to incomplete DNA repair and the accumulation of mutations and, ultimately, to genetic instability. These findings provide evidence indicating that the differentiation process &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; places stress on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

Thus, &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; has adapted exosome-mediated cross-kingdom RNA interference as part of its immune responses during the evolutionary arms race with the pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1126?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Botany, Molecular Biology</item></keywords><crawled>1528398419859</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163dba51793:6879dc9:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00586</originId><origin><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId></origin><published>1525838400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00586</link><title>[ASAP] Automatic Differentiation in Quantum Chemistry with Applications to Fully Variational Hartree–Fock</title><fingerprint>e231ece8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00586/20180509/images/medium/oc-2017-00586m_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.7b00586&lt;/div&gt;</description><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_163462eaa96:1b071a:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Teresa Tamayo-Mendoza, Christoph Kreisbeck, Roland Lindh, Alán Aspuru-Guzik</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00586/20180509/images/medium/oc-2017-00586m_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.7b00586&lt;/div&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00586</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525890853526</crawled><visual><height>289</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00586/20180509/images/medium/oc-2017-00586m_0004.gif</url><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00271</originId><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId></origin><published>1526961600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00271</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00271</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Cost-Effective Method for Free-Energy Minimization in Complex Systems with Elaborated Ab Initio Potentials</title><fingerprint>42e692b4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00271/20180521/images/medium/ct-2018-00271d_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00271&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Shultz&lt;/p&gt;
In long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most studied types of neural plasticity, synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to stimulation. Although a number of different proteins have been implicated in the sub-cellular molecular processes underlying induction and maintenance of LTP, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A particular challenge is to demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans. Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one involving the atypical protein kinase PKMζ and its messenger RNA, the other involving PKMζ and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate that robust bistability–stable equilibria both in the synapse’s potentiated and unpotentiated states–can arise from a set of simple molecular reactions. The model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation and the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_PVuKNJRBs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527615723856</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Helfer, Thomas R.

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</content></content><author><name>Yusuke Shintani</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

Merosin deficient congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;LAMA2&lt;/i&gt; gene leading to severe and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Although over 350 causative mutations have been identified for MDC1A, no treatment is yet available. There are many therapeutic approaches in development, but the lack of natural history data of the mouse model and standardized outcome measures makes it difficult to transit these pre-clinical findings to clinical trials. Therefore, in the present study, we collected natural history data and assessed pre-clinical outcome measures for the &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model using standardized operating procedures available from the TREAT-NMD Alliance. Wild type and &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice were subjected to five different functional tests from the age of four to 32 weeks. Non-tested control groups were taken along to assess whether the functional test regime interfered with muscle pathology. Respiratory function, body weights and creatine kinase levels were recorded. Lastly, skeletal muscles were collected for further histopathological and gene expression analyses. Muscle function of &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice was severely impaired at four weeks of age and all mice lost the ability to use their hind limbs. Moreover, respiratory function was altered in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Interestingly, the respiration rate was decreased and declined with age, whereas the respiration amplitude was increased in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice when compared to wild type mice. Creatine kinase levels were comparable to wild type mice. Muscle histopathology and gene expression analysis revealed that there was a specific regional distribution pattern of muscle damage in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Gastrocnemius appeared to be the most severely affected muscle with a high proportion of atrophic fibers, increased fibrosis and inflammation. By contrast, triceps was affected moderately and diaphragm only mildly.

Background &lt;p&gt;Effective HIV prevention requires efficient delivery of safe and efficacious drugs and optimization of user adherence. The user’s experiences with the drug, delivery system, and use parameters are critical to product acceptability and adherence. Prevention product developers have the opportunity to directly control a drug delivery system and its impact on acceptability and adherence, as well as product efficacy. Involvement of potential users during preclinical design and development can facilitate this process. We embedded a mixed methods user evaluation study into a safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) trial of a pod-intravaginal ring delivering antiretroviral agents.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Women enrolled in two cohorts, ultimately evaluating the safety/PK of a pod-IVRs delivering TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, and/or TDF-FTC-MVC. A 7-day use period was targeted for each pod-IVR, regardless of drug or drug combination. During the clinical study, participants provided both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., in-depth interview) data capturing acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence behaviors. Initial sexual and reproductive health history surveys, daily diaries, a final acceptability and willingness to use survey, and a qualitative in-depth interview comprised the user evaluation data for each pod-IVR experienced by the participants.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Overall, the majority of participants (N = 10) reported being willing to use the pod-IVR platform for HIV prevention should it advance to market. Confidence to use the pod-IVR (e.g., insertion, removal) was high. There were no differences noted in the user experience of the pod-IVR platform; that is, whether the ring delivered TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, or TDF-FTC-MVC, users’ experiences of the ring were similar and acceptable.

Background &lt;p&gt;Effective HIV prevention requires efficient delivery of safe and efficacious drugs and optimization of user adherence. The user’s experiences with the drug, delivery system, and use parameters are critical to product acceptability and adherence. Prevention product developers have the opportunity to directly control a drug delivery system and its impact on acceptability and adherence, as well as product efficacy. Involvement of potential users during preclinical design and development can facilitate this process. We embedded a mixed methods user evaluation study into a safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) trial of a pod-intravaginal ring delivering antiretroviral agents.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Women enrolled in two cohorts, ultimately evaluating the safety/PK of a pod-IVRs delivering TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, and/or TDF-FTC-MVC. A 7-day use period was targeted for each pod-IVR, regardless of drug or drug combination. During the clinical study, participants provided both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., in-depth interview) data capturing acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence behaviors. Initial sexual and reproductive health history surveys, daily diaries, a final acceptability and willingness to use survey, and a qualitative in-depth interview comprised the user evaluation data for each pod-IVR experienced by the participants.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Overall, the majority of participants (N = 10) reported being willing to use the pod-IVR platform for HIV prevention should it advance to market. Confidence to use the pod-IVR (e.g., insertion, removal) was high. There were no differences noted in the user experience of the pod-IVR platform; that is, whether the ring delivered TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, or TDF-FTC-MVC, users’ experiences of the ring were similar and acceptable. Participants did report specific experiences, both sensory and behavioral, that impacted their use behaviors with respect to the ring, and which could ultimately impact acceptability and adherence.

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526935325513</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Hyun Bak, Seogjoo J.

Background &lt;p&gt;The nature of the relationship between fatigue and its risk factors is poorly understood. In the present study the genetic and environmental association between anxiety-depression, musculoskeletal (MS) pain and fatigue was examined, and the role of neuroticism as a shared risk factor that may possibly explain the co-occurrence between these phenotypes was investigated in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal twin design.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The sample consisted of 746 monozygotic (MZ) and 770 dizygotic (DZ) twins in the age group of 50–65 (mean = 57.11 years, SD = 4.5). Continuous measures of fatigue symptoms and the other phenotypes were employed. Using Cholesky modeling, genetic and environmental influences on the phenotypes, and the associations among them, were determined. Analyses were performed using measures of neuroticism obtained concurrently and 13–19 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Results from multiple regression analyses showed that neuroticism, anxiety-depression symptoms, and MS pain were all significantly associated with fatigue, controlling for sex, education, and general health indices. The best-fitting biometric models included additive genetic and individual-specific environmental effects. Heritabilities in the 0.40–0.53 range were demonstrated. Furthermore, while there was a considerable overlap in genetic risk factors between the four phenotypes, a substantial proportion of the genetic risk shared between anxiety-depression and fatigue, and between MS pain and fatigue, was independent of neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Evidence for a common underlying susceptibility to report fatigue symptoms, genetically linked to neuroticism, anxiety-depression, and MS pain, was found.

Analyses were performed using measures of neuroticism obtained concurrently and 13–19 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Results from multiple regression analyses showed that neuroticism, anxiety-depression symptoms, and MS pain were all significantly associated with fatigue, controlling for sex, education, and general health indices. The best-fitting biometric models included additive genetic and individual-specific environmental effects. Heritabilities in the 0.40–0.53 range were demonstrated. Furthermore, while there was a considerable overlap in genetic risk factors between the four phenotypes, a substantial proportion of the genetic risk shared between anxiety-depression and fatigue, and between MS pain and fatigue, was independent of neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Evidence for a common underlying susceptibility to report fatigue symptoms, genetically linked to neuroticism, anxiety-depression, and MS pain, was found. Both unique and pleiotropic effects appear to be involved in the genetic architecture of the phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198594</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:6683350:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25231?af=R</originId><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Stanislav M.Avdoshenko</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25231?af=R</link><title>Fullerene faraday cage keeps magnetic properties of inner cluster pristine</title><fingerprint>5c5c734e</fingerprint><description>Any single molecular magnets (SMMs) perspective for application is as good as its magnetization stability in ambient conditions.

Annatto (&lt;i&gt;Bixa orellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is a tropical American crop, commercially valuable due to its application in the food and cosmetics industries as a natural dye. The wild ancestor of cultivated annatto is &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;orellana&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;urucurana&lt;/i&gt;. Although never cultivated, this variety occurs in open forests and anthropogenic landscapes, and is always associated with riparian environments. In this study, we evaluated the genetic diversity and structure of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;orellana&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;urucurana&lt;/i&gt; populations in Brazilian Amazonia using 16 microsatellite loci. We used Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) to characterize the potential geographical range of this variety in northern South America. We analyzed 170 samples from 10 municipalities in the states of Rondônia, Pará and Roraima. A total of 194 alleles was observed, with an average of 12.1 alleles per locus. Higher levels of expected (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) than observed (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;) heterozygosities were found for all populations.

A strong and positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances was found, suggesting that genetic differentiation might be caused by geographic isolation. From species distribution modelling, we detected that South Rondônia, Madre di Dios River basin, Llanos de Mojos, Llanos de Orinoco and eastern Ecuador are highly suitable areas for wild annatto to occur, providing additional targets for future exploration and conservation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Crime and violence causes massive disruptions to the health, survival and development of populations. In South Africa, incredibly high rates of crime and violence are noted. The country also has a very large youth population whose health, survival and development are key to economic growth.

This study examines the relationship between perceived community safety and the uptake of social activities among youth in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Data and methods &lt;p&gt;This paper uses data from the National Youth Lifestyle Survey (2008) with an unweighted sample of 4,391 youth (age12-22 years old). Using chi-square and logistic regression analysis the association between perceived community safety and social activity participation are tested.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that youth participation in social activities in South Africa is high (55% of males and 45% of females). Among males, the most prominent activity is sports (51.8%), while for females there is high participation in choir and singing groups (55.68%). More than 50% of males perceive their communities as risky while less than half of females feel the same. Male youth are more likely to participate in social activities if they perceive their communities as risky (OR = 1.04). Females (OR = 0.83), youth have a negative view of their future (OR = 0.43) are less likely to participate in social activities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There exists an association between youth’s perception of community safety and their participation in social activities.

Although it has been recognized that intestinal bacteria play an important role in the pathology of human ulcerative colitis (UC), specific pathogenic bacteria for UC have not been identified. We investigated the influence of &lt;i&gt;Paraclostridium bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 strain on the pathology of a UC mouse model and found it increased UC pathosis scores such as loose and bloody stools, reduced diversity of fecal flora, disappearance of the crypt structure of distal colon tissue, destruction of intestinal epithelial cells, and atrophy of the colon. Furthermore, we observed an increase in &lt;i&gt;COX-2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF-α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-17&lt;/i&gt; expression and a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Foxp3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; expression, as inflammation-related factors and inflammatory cytokines, a decrease in the concentration of short chain fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) in feces, and an increase of intestinal mucosal myeloperoxidase activity.

The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a complex, multifactorial disorder that develops slowly over time presenting itself with large differences among MetS patients. We applied a systems biology approach to describe and predict the onset and progressive development of MetS, in a study that combined &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; models. A new data-driven, physiological model (MINGLeD: Model INtegrating Glucose and Lipid Dynamics) was developed, describing glucose, lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Since classic kinetic models cannot describe slowly progressing disorders, a simulation method (ADAPT) was used to describe longitudinal dynamics and to predict metabolic concentrations and fluxes. This approach yielded a novel model that can describe long-term MetS development and progression. This model was integrated with longitudinal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data that was obtained from male APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for three months and that developed MetS as reflected by classical symptoms including obesity and glucose intolerance. Two distinct subgroups were identified: those who developed dyslipidemia, and those who did not. The combination of MINGLeD with ADAPT could correctly predict both phenotypes, without making any prior assumptions about changes in kinetic rates or metabolic regulation. Modeling and flux trajectory analysis revealed that differences in liver fluxes and dietary cholesterol absorption could explain this occurrence of the two different phenotypes. In individual mice with dyslipidemia dietary cholesterol absorption and hepatic turnover of metabolites, including lipid fluxes, were higher compared to those without dyslipidemia. Predicted differences were also observed in gene expression data, and consistent with the emergence of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, two well-known MetS co-morbidities. Whereas MINGLeD specifically models the metabolic derangements underlying MetS, the simulation method ADAPT is generic and can be applied to other diseases where dynamic modeling and longitudinal data are available.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MIj7qbH_8I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1528404128581</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yvonne J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Combination treatment with ramucirumab and paclitaxel shows significant efficacy in patients with advanced gastric cancer as a second-line standard therapy. However, limited information is available about the development of pneumonitis associated with this treatment in clinical practice. This study aimed to characterize this form of pneumonitis and identify the risk factors for its onset.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 44 patients with gastric cancer who received combination treatment with ramucirumab and paclitaxel from 2016 to 2017. Then, the clinicopathological characteristics of patients who developed treatment-related pneumonitis were evaluated and further compared with those of patients who did not.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Six patients (13.6%) developed pneumonitis within five treatment cycles, and in five cases, remission was observed after cessation of combination treatment alone. The onset of pneumonitis was independently associated with pre-existing interstitial lung disease (ILD) (p = 0.025; odds ratio = 206.4). Patients with pneumonitis showed reduced time to treatment failure (median 56 vs. 138 days; p = 0.008), as compared with those without pneumonitis. Most patients with pre-existing ILD with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern developed pneumonitis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In clinical practice, pneumonitis associated with the combination treatment of ramucirumab and paclitaxel was generally mild, but common.

We extend our analysis of zebrafish development to show that bHLH activity is responsible for the mediolateral patterning of the entire mesodermal germ layer.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31018</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><crawled>1528372993296</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163da211d10:651efc4:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24236-y</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Gabriella Guelfi</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>379</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24236-y/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24236_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><engagement>12</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24236-y</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24236-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Next Generation Sequencing of urine exfoliated cells: an approach of prostate cancer microRNAs research</title><fingerprint>c7410bf3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next Generation Sequencing of urine exfoliated cells: an approach of prostate cancer microRNAs research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next Generation Sequencing of urine exfoliated cells: an approach of prostate cancer microRNAs research, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24236-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24236-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Next Generation Sequencing of urine exfoliated cells: an approach of prostate cancer microRNAs research&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/YuBFYpQ3tV4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1525762800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next Generation Sequencing of urine exfoliated cells: an approach of prostate cancer microRNAs research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next Generation Sequencing of urine exfoliated cells: an approach of prostate cancer microRNAs research, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24236-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24236-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Next Generation Sequencing of urine exfoliated cells: an approach of prostate cancer microRNAs research&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/YuBFYpQ3tV4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/YuBFYpQ3tV4/s41598-018-24236-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525770957557</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f0932f5:133cbf:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/326223v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Al Mahi, N.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/19/326223</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/326223v1?rss=1</link><title>GREIN: An interactive web platform for re-analyzing GEO RNA-seq data [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>51ee5c6b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The vast amount of RNA-seq data deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is still a grossly underutilized resource for biomedical research.

PASEF on the timsTOF Pro is a valuable addition to the technological toolbox in proteomics, with a number of unique operating modes that are only beginning to be explored.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/336743v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527879174073</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163bcb207b9:3acd0fc:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00403</originId><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId></origin><published>1525752000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00403</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00403</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Most Ligand-Based Classification Benchmarks Reward Memorization Rather than Generalization</title><fingerprint>b37a3293</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00403/20180508/images/medium/ci-2017-00403n_0019.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00403&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work in this paper on the synthetic procedures, both to prepare these compounds and to investigate their chemistry. What it tells you is that (as you would have figured) that C-to-Si is a nontrivial switch in the fume hood, because the chemistries involved can be quite different. For instance, that first core on the list does N-alkylation and N-acylation reactions just fine, but when you try to do metal-catalyzed N-C couplings on it, things go to pieces (protodesilylation and other decomposition reactions). Protodesilylation in general was something that had to be looked out for, with attention paid to solvent choice and temperature in the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme that comes up several times is that the nitrogens, when exposed to base, can be significantly more prone to oxidative side reactions than expected (even fairly simple reductive amination reactions had to be performed under inert atmosphere, although they were successful then). Metalation reactions were also tricky. Some of them worked just fine and reacted as expected with a range of electrophiles, while others would work with some partners but not others. But some of them just fell apart immediately on attempts to form the anions (such as C2 of the second compound on the list shown), and the only way to find that out was to try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the group was able to prepare an impressive range of functionalized derivatives of these cores, almost all of which are shots into unknown territory. How, then, do such compounds behave? Their cLogP values are almost invariably higher than their carbon analogs, but as usual when you move into unusual structure space, it would be interesting to have some experimental values to make sure that that some of this just isn’t a problem with the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the Si and C matched pairs in assays, there seems to be no difference in P-gp transporter behavior &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, for starters. There was a slight trend towards more instability against CYP enzymes, but this wasn’t universal (and was also species-dependent, with the rat enzymes being more vigorous. (That’s often the case; rats have a reputation for having more strongly oxidizing liver enzymes, which I’ve always attributed to their rather broad definitions of suitable food). Inhibition of these enzymes didn’t show much of a trend one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second compound on the list above and its carbon analog were compared in rat PK experiments as well (oral and i.v.) Intravenous behavior was fairly similar – the Si compound had slightly higher clearance and slightly higher volume of distribution. As for p.o. dosing, the Si compound is significantly more bioavailable, although it has a lower Cmax. Overall AUC was pretty much the same, though. And even though it had greater instability to the rat enzymes, it had a twofold great half-life&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, which makes you think plasma protein binding. So this is only one point, but taken with the other Si compounds in the literature, it seems as if they fall inside the normal range of variation that you see with all-carbon compounds – there’s nothing intrinsically weird about them from a pharmacokinetic/metabolic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up what I mentioned in my past last year, though: perhaps it would be better for silicon-containing drugs if there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; something unusual about them. Admittedly, that could also be “unusually bad”, but overall, it’s harder to make the case for moving to silicon if the effects of doing so are (a) not huge and (b) not all that predictable. You’re already in that zone with carbon analogs, most likely, so why bother? The paper itself has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This lack of success in the pharmaceutical industry may be attributed to two key factors: (1) an absence of general and accessible synthetic methods for the construction of appropriately functionalized silicon-containing molecules and (2) ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon, of which the “carbon/silicon switch” is the most common. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that second point is what we’re talking about. “Ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon”, from another angle, means “lack of a good reason to use it at all”. If some effective uses for it can be found – and they may well be out there, who knows? – then things will change. But not until then. If the late-stage silicon switch doesn’t necessarily get you anything, it’s true that you’re going to have to look earlier (good activity in a silicon-containing compound that isn’t replicated by its carbon analog), and this work is an attempt to provide a host of new Si-containing chemical matter towards that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would go a long way to answering the overall question would be if someone were to produce a library of (say) ten or twenty thousand diverse silicon-containing drug-like structures and their exact carbon analogs, and do some high-throughput screening campaigns (variously targeted, cellular, and phenotypic) to see how they behave. But no one’s going to go to that trouble just yet, for just the reasons described (an absence of ways to make such things and an absence of compelling reasons to make them). The chicken and egg question remains.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1526478652000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here’s an update to a post from last year about silicon in drug-like molecules.

In the 5‐step carboxylase reaction, the substrate Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP) first binds Rubisco and undergoes enolization before binding the second substrate, CO2. Hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex is followed by CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation. However, details of the roles and protonation states of active‐site residues, and sources of protons and water, remain highly speculative. Large‐scale computations on active‐site models provide a means to better understand this complex chemical mechanism. The computational protocol comprises a combination of hybrid semi‐empirical quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics within constrained molecular dynamics simulations, together with constrained gradient minimization calculations using density functional theory. Alternative pathways for hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex and associated active‐site protonation networks and proton and water sources were investigated. The main findings from analysis of the resulting energetics advocate major revision to existing mechanisms such that: hydration takes place anti to the CO2; both hydration and CC bond scission require early protonation of CO2 in the RuBP.CO2 complex; CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation reactions are concerted and, effectively, there is only one stable intermediate, the C3‐gemdiolate complex.

A new set of efficient solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force fields was developed for phospholipids and peptides. To enhance transferability, this model maps around four heavy atoms and their connected hydrogen atoms into a coarse-grained elementary bead based on functional group. The effective hybrid potential between any pair of beads is composed of a short-range repulsive soft-core potential that directly adopts the form of an explicit-solvent DPD model and a long-range attractive hydrophobic potential. The parameters of the attractive potentials for lipid molecules were obtained by fitting the explicit-solvent DPD simulation of one bead of any type in a water box, then finely tuning it until the bilayer membrane properties obtained in the explicit-solvent model were matched. These parameters were further extended to amino acids according to bead type. The structural and elastic properties of bilayer membranes, free energy profiles for a lipid flip-flop and amino acid analogues translocating across the membrane, and membrane pore formation induced by antimicrobial peptides obtained from this solvent-free DPD force field considerably agreed with the explicit-solvent DPD results.

Taken together, our study represents a significant advance in characterization and identification of lncRNAs and LGC thus bears broad potential utility for computational analysis of lncRNAs in a wide range of species.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327882v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527704765564</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163b24cc47c:29d8098:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/866-b?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527183688000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/866.2.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/866-b?rss=1</link><title>Trout in hot water: A call for global action</title><fingerprint>df0c6c3c</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce956:3dd877af</id><author><name>Muhlfeld, C.

Since endophytes can affect metabolism of host plants, they are expected to be used to improve crop quality, especially for crops with organoleptic sensitive products such as wine grape. However, details of metabolic interactions between endophytes and host plants were less understood. In this work, we used high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the metabolites of fruit flesh cells of grape treated with dual culture of different endophytic fungal strains (EFS). We observed that the dual-culture with different fungal strains show different metabolites composition in grape cells. In response to different EFS, quantities of detected metabolites in grape cells varied from 6 to 17 in this assay, and 1 to 11 novel metabolites were introduced into metabolome of grape cells. Dual-culture with fungal strains CS2, RH16 and RH5 introduced the highest quantities (10 or 11) of novel metabolites in grape cells. More importantly, the modification of metabolic profiles in grape cells &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; fungal endophytes appeared to be fungal strain/genus-specificity.

The full-length cDNA sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;.

Two hypotheses are tested using experimental design and non-parametric hypothesis testing procedures to evaluate the outlier detection performance of the semi-supervised encoding approach and increasing demographic precision in encoding. Results: The experiments involved applying 492 encoders to 30 laboratory tests extracted from the Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) from Partners HealthCare.

Conclusion: Given the multiplicity of distributions for a single observation in EHR data (i.e., same observation represented with different names or units), as well as non-linearity of human observations, encoding offers huge promises for outlier detection in large-scale data repositories.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/334771v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527717066175</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163b30875bf:2a329ec:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026922?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>M.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Although locally invasive or recurrent fibromatosis is primarily treated with surgery, radiotherapy (RT) produces local control for recurrent/unresectable tumors or those with positive surgical margins. Herein, we describe our updated institutional experience with RT to treat fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven patients with fibromatosis received RT between 1990 and 2015, and were followed for ≥12 months. Eight patients received RT for gross tumors, and 39 received postoperative RT after single/multiple prior surgeries. A median dose of 54 Gy was prescribed for definitive RT; 48.6, 50.4, and 54 Gy were prescribed for R0, R1, and R2 resected tumors, respectively. Recurrences were classified as in-field, marginal, or out-field. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven recurrences were noted, including 2 in-field, 4 marginal, and 1 out-field, after a median follow-up of 60 months. In-field recurrences occurred in 1 patient who received 40.5 Gy of salvage RT after postoperative recurrence and another who received 45 Gy for R1 resection after multiple prior operations. All marginal failures were due to insufficient clinical target volume (CTV) margins regardless of dose (3 with 45 Gy and 1 with 54 Gy). On multivariate analysis, a CTV margin ≥5 cm and dose &gt;45 Gy were significant predictors of non-recurrence (p = 0.039 and 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with both an CTV margin ≥5 cm and a dose &gt;45 Gy showed a favorable outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RT is a valuable option for treating aggressive fibromatosis; doses ≥45 Gy and a large field produce optimal results. For in-field control, a higher dose is more necessary for gross residual tumors than for totally excised lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Seo Hee Choi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seo Hee Choi, Hong In Yoon, Seung Hyun Kim, Sang Kyum Kim, Kyoo-Ho Shin, Chang-Ok Suh&lt;/p&gt;

The link between athlete physique and performance in sports is well established. However, a direct link between somatotype three-numeral rating and anaerobic performance has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the relations between somatotype and anaerobic performance using both singular and multivariate analyses. Thirty-six physically active males (mean ± standard deviation age 26.0 ± 9.8 years; body mass 79.5 ± 12.9 kg; height 1.82 ± 0.07 m) were somatotype-rated using the Heath-Carter method. Subjects were assessed for 3 repetition maximum (3 RM) bench press and back squat, and completed a 30-second maximal sprint cycle test. Positive correlations were observed between mesomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = 0.560, p &amp;lt; 0.001), mesomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = 0.550, p = 0.001) and between mesomorphy and minimum power output (r = 0.357, p = 0.033). Negative correlations were observed between ectomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = -0.381, p = 0.022), and ectomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = -0.336, p = 0.045). Individual regression analysis indicated that mesomorphy was the best predictor of 3 RM bench press performance, with 31.4% of variance in 3 RM bench press performance accounted for by the mesomorphy rating (p &amp;lt; 0.001). A combination of mesomorphy and ectomorphy best predicted 3 RM back squat performance (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.388, p &amp;lt; 0.04). Around one third of strength performance is predicted by somatotype-assessed physique in physically active males. This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes.</content></content><author><name>Helen Ryan-Stewart</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Helen Ryan-Stewart, James Faulkner, Simon Jobson&lt;/p&gt;
