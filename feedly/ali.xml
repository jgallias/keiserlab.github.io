Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt;, currently affecting more than 200 million people. Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</content></content><title>Epiisopilosine alkaloid has activity against &amp;lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&amp;lt;/i&gt; in mice without acute toxicity</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f67:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria A.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is state of the art in molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this context, maintenance of assay fidelity and detection of technical inaccuracy are crucial. Beside multiple common negative controls for the clinical sample preparations, quality control charts (QCC) are a common validation tool to sustain high process quality by continuously recording of qRT-PCR control parameters. Here, we report on establishment and benefit of QCC in qRT-PCR-based CML diagnostics. The absolute quantification of &lt;i&gt;BCR-ABL1&lt;/i&gt; fusion transcripts in patient samples is based on coamplification of a serially diluted reference plasmid (pME-2). For QCC establishment the measured Ct values of each pME-2 standard dilution (4–400,000) of a test set resembling 21 sequential qRT-PCR experiments were recorded and statistically evaluated. Test set data were used for determination of warning limits (mean +/- 2-fold standard deviation) and control (intervention) limits (mean +/- 3-fold standard deviation) to allow rapid detection of defined out-of-control situations which may require intervention. We have retrospectively analyzed QCC data of 282 sequential qRT-PCR experiments (564 reactions). Data evaluation using QCCs revealed three out-of-control situations that required intervention like experiment repeats, renewal of pME-2 standards, replacement of reagents or personnel re-training. In conclusion, with minimal more effort and hands-on time QCC rank among the best tools to grant high quality and reproducibility in CML routine molecular diagnosis.</content></content><title>The benefit of quality control charts (QCC) for routine quantitative &amp;lt;i&gt;BCR-ABL1&amp;lt;/i&gt; monitoring in chronic myeloid leukemia</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fae:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Birgit Spiess, Nicole Naumann, Norbert Galuschek, Sébastien Rinaldetti, Ute Kossak-Roth, Irina Tarnopolscaia, Elena Felde, Alice Fabarius, Wolf-Karsten Hofmann, Susanne Saußele, Wolfgang Seifarth&lt;/p&gt;

The purple sea urchin, &lt;i&gt;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&lt;/i&gt;, has a complex and robust immune system that is mediated by a number of multi-gene families including the &lt;i&gt;SpTransformer&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt;) gene family (formerly &lt;i&gt;Sp185/333&lt;/i&gt;). In response to immune challenge from bacteria and various pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the &lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt; genes are up-regulated in sea urchin phagocytes and express a diverse array of SpTrf proteins. We show here that SpTrf proteins from coelomocytes and isolated by nickel affinity (cNi-SpTrf) bind to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and to Baker’s yeast, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, with saturable kinetics and specificity. cNi-SpTrf opsonization of the marine bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Vibrio diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt;, augments phagocytosis, however, opsonization by the recombinant protein, rSpTrf-E1, does not. Binding by cNi-SpTrf proteins retards growth rates significantly for several species of bacteria. SpTrf proteins, previously thought to be strictly membrane-associated, are secreted from phagocytes in short term cultures and bind &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt; that are located both outside of and within phagocytes. Our results demonstrate anti-microbial activities of native SpTrf proteins and suggest variable functions among different SpTrf isoforms. Multiple isoforms may act synergistically to detect a wide array of pathogens and provide flexible and efficient host immunity.</content></content><title>SpTransformer proteins from the purple sea urchin opsonize bacteria, augment phagocytosis, and retard bacterial growth</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475053:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hung-Yen Chou, Cheng Man Lun, L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Preclinical breast cancer models recapitulating the clinical course of metastatic disease are crucial for drug development. Highly metastatic cell lines forming spontaneous metastasis following orthotopic implantation were previously developed and characterized regarding their biological and histological characteristics. This study aimed to non-invasively and longitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formation and progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14–16 days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity of primary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT and fluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agent administration.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10 days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice, predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake.

Milk oligosaccharides (OS) are a key factor that influences the infant gut microbial composition, and their importance in promoting healthy infant development and disease prevention is becoming increasingly apparent. Investigating the structures, properties, and sources of these compounds requires a host of complementary analytical techniques. Relative compound quantification by mass spectral analysis of isobarically labeled samples is a relatively new technique that has been used mainly in the proteomics field. Glycomics applications have so far focused on analysis of protein-linked glycans, while analysis of free milk OS has previously been conducted only on analytical standards. In this paper, we extend the use of isobaric glycan tags to the analysis of bovine milk OS by presenting a method for separation of labeled OS on a porous graphitized carbon liquid chromatographic column with subsequent analysis by quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Abundances for 15 OS extracted from mature bovine milk were measured, with replicate injections providing coefficients of variation below 15% for most OS. Isobaric labeling improved ionization efficiency for low-abundance, high-molecular weight fucosylated OS, which are known to exist in bovine milk but have been only sporadically reported in the literature. We compared the abundances of four fucosylated OS in milk from Holstein and Jersey cattle and found that three of the compounds were more abundant in Jersey milk, which is in general agreement with a previous study. This novel method represents an advancement in our ability to characterize milk OS and provides the advantages associated with isobaric labeling, including reduced instrumental analysis time and increased analyte ionization efficiency. This improved ability to measure differences in bioactive OS abundances in large datasets will facilitate exploration of OS from all food sources for the purpose of developing health-guiding products for infants, immune-compromised elderly, and the population at large.</content></content><title>Multiplexed bovine milk oligosaccharide analysis with aminoxy tandem mass tags</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae76:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Randall C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is considered a major worldwide health burden, with high mortality and associated costs. Health indicators are essential to define strategies to improve the treatment of diseases, and the epidemiology information of sepsis in developing countries is scarce. Thus, the aim of this work is to assess trends in the incidence, lethality, costs, and other indicators of sepsis for Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS—&lt;i&gt;Sistema Único de Saúde&lt;/i&gt;) hospitalizations for the period from January 2006 to December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted this study using data from the SUS hospital information system. We selected registries of SUS hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with sepsis (total of 724,458 cases from 4,271 public and private Brazilian hospitals).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2015, the annual sepsis incidence increased 50.5% from 31.5/100,000 to 47.4/100,000 persons. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 9.0 days. A total of 29.1% of the hospitalizations had admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a mean ICU LOS of 8.0 days. The mean cost per hospitalization was US$624.0 and for hospitalizations requiring intensive care was U$1,708.1. The overall sepsis lethality rate was 46.3%, and for hospitalizations with admission to the ICU, it was 64.5%. During the study period, the lethality rate for children/teenagers decreased 40.1%, but for all other age groups it increased 11.4%. The sepsis lethality rate in public hospitals (55.5%) was higher than private hospitals (37.0%) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The mean hospitalization LOS for public hospitals (10.3 days) was higher than private hospitals (7.6 days) (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incidence and lethality rate of sepsis increased in SUS hospitalizations during the study period.

Cities around the world are inundated by cars and suffer traffic congestion that results in excess delays, reduced safety and environmental pollution. The interplay between road infrastructure and travel choices defines the level and the spatio-temporal extent of congestion. Given the existing infrastructure, understanding how the route choice decisions are made and how travellers interact with each other is a crucial first step in mitigating traffic congestion. This is a problem with fundamental importance, as it has implications for other limited supply systems where agents compete for resources and reach an equilibrium. Here, we observe the route choice decisions and the traffic conditions through an extensive data set of GPS trajectories. We compare the actual paths followed by travellers to those implied by equilibrium conditions (i) at a microscopic scale, where we focus on individual path similarities, and (ii) at a macroscopic scale, where we perform network-level comparison of the traffic loads. We present that non-cooperative or selfish equilibrium replicates the actual traffic (to a certain extent) at the macroscopic scale, while the majority of individual decisions cannot be reproduced by neither selfish nor cooperative equilibrium models.</content></content><title>Searching for empirical evidence on traffic equilibrium</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42265:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehmet Yildirimoglu, Osman Kahraman&lt;/p&gt;

Sarcomeres are stereotyped force-producing mini-machines of striated muscles. Each sarcomere contains a pseudocrystalline order of bipolar actin and myosin filaments, which are linked by titin filaments. During muscle development, these three filament types need to assemble into long periodic chains of sarcomeres called myofibrils. Initially, myofibrils contain immature sarcomeres, which gradually mature into their pseudocrystalline order. Despite the general importance, our understanding of myofibril assembly and sarcomere maturation in vivo is limited, in large part because determining the molecular order of protein components during muscle development remains challenging. Here, we applied polarization-resolved microscopy to determine the molecular order of actin during myofibrillogenesis in vivo. This method revealed that, concomitantly with mechanical tension buildup in the myotube, molecular actin order increases, preceding the formation of immature sarcomeres. Mechanistically, both muscle and nonmuscle myosin contribute to this actin order gain during early stages of myofibril assembly. Actin order continues to increase while myofibrils and sarcomeres mature. Muscle myosin motor activity is required for the regular and coordinated assembly of long myofibrils but not for the high actin order buildup during sarcomere maturation. This suggests that, in muscle, other actin-binding proteins are sufficient to locally bundle or cross-link actin into highly regular arrays.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MVEVVAfNdiw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Polarization-resolved microscopy reveals a muscle myosin motor-independent mechanism of molecular actin ordering during sarcomere maturation</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16308305f07:446896:c2c34441</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olivier Loison, Manuela Weitkunat, Aynur Kaya-Çopur, Camila Nascimento Alves, Till Matzat, Maria L.

The use of model-based propensity scores as matching tools opens the way to the indirect estimation of mode-related measurement effects and selection effects in web surveys, including a component of selection that cannot be traced back to observable characteristics. By matching and comparing respondents from real independent surveys that use the same questionnaire, but different administration modes, it becomes possible to isolate the selection effect induced by unobservable (or unobserved) respondent characteristics. This study applies a stratification matching algorithm to compare a web survey from a proprietary panel with a computer-assisted telephone survey based on random digit-dialing. The experiment is run in two countries (UK and Italy) to check for consistencies across different cultures and different internet penetration rates. The application to the elicitation of support for healthy eating policies indicates large and significant measurement and selection effects. After controlling for differences in the observed characteristics of respondents and the intensity of internet use, findings suggest that web surveys record lower support and higher neutrality. Similarly, after controlling for administration mode and observed respondent characteristics, internet users are less likely to state support compared to non-users. This suggests that unobserved characteristics play a major role, and post-stratification weighting is not a sufficient countermeasure. As demonstrated by the cross-country comparison, rising internet penetration rates are not a guarantee against this type of error, as disparities in these unobserved characteristics are likely to increase at the same time.</content></content><title>Estimation of unobservable selection effects in on-line surveys through propensity score matching: An application to public acceptance of healthy eating policies</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344162:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Capacci, Mario Mazzocchi, Sergio Brasini&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, while next-generation amplicon sequencing can be very accurate, high costs (&gt;$30 per sample) and turnaround times (&gt;1 month) limit the nature and pace of experiments. Here, we introduce a new approach for quantifying composition in synthetic bacterial communities based on Sanger sequencing. First, for a given community, we PCR-amplify a universal marker gene (here, the 16S rRNA gene), which yields a mixture of amplicons. Second, we sequence this amplicon mixture in a single Sanger sequencing reaction, which produces a &amp;quot;mixed&amp;quot; electropherogram with contributions from each community member. We also sequence each community member&apos;s marker gene individually to generate &amp;quot;individual&amp;quot; electropherograms. Third, we fit the mixed electropherogram as a linear combination of time-warped individual electropherograms, thereby allowing us to estimate the fractional amplicon abundance of each strain within the community. Importantly, our approach accounts for retention-time variability in electrophoretic signals, which is crucial for accurate compositional estimates. Using synthetic communities of marine bacterial isolates, we show that this approach yields accurate and reproducible abundance estimates for two-, four-, and seven-strain bacterial communities. Furthermore, this approach can provide results within one day and costs ~$5 USD per sample.

Information on circulating miRNAs in frontotemporal lobar degeneration is very limited and conflicting results have complicated an interpretation in Alzheimer’s disease thus far. In the present study we I) collected samples from multiple clinical centers across Germany, II) defined 3 homogenous patient groups with high sample sizes (bvFTD n = 48, AD n = 48 and cognitively healthy controls n = 44), III) compared expression levels in both CSF and serum samples and IV) detected a limited set of miRNAs by using a MIQE compliant protocol based on SYBR-green miRCURY assays that have proven reliable to generate reproducible results. We included several quality controls that identified and reduced technical variation to increase the reliability of our data. We showed that the expression levels of circulating miRNAs measured in CSF did not correlate with levels in serum. Using cluster analysis we found expression pattern in serum that, in part, reflects the genomic organization and affiliation to a specific miRNA family and that were specifically altered in bvFTD, AD, and control groups. Applying factor analysis we identified a 3-factor model characterized by a miRNA signature that explained 80% of the variance classifying healthy controls with 97%, bvFTD with 77% and AD with 72% accuracy. MANOVA confirmed signals like miR-320a and miR-26b-5p at BH corrected significance that contributed most to discriminate bvFTD cases with 96% sensitivity and 90% specificity and AD cases with 89% sensitivity and specificity compared to healthy controls, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that miRNAs from the 3-factor model also correlated with levels of protein biomarker amyloid-beta&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, indicating their potential role in the monitoring of progressive neuronal degeneration. Our data show that miRNAs can be reproducibly measured in serum and CSF without pre-amplification and that serum includes higher expressed signals that demonstrate an overall better ability to classify bvFTD, AD and healthy controls compared to signals detected in CSF.</content></content><title>Specific serum and CSF microRNA profiles distinguish sporadic behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia compared with Alzheimer patients and cognitively healthy controls</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559160:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Johannes Denk, Felix Oberhauser, Johannes Kornhuber, Jens Wiltfang, Klaus Fassbender, Matthias L.

In addition, an interaction between intracellular loop 1 of the receptor and the β subunit of the G protein was observed.</description><crawled>1525434520278</crawled><fingerprint>5bdbeecd</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35946</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><published>1525392000000</published><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35946</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35946</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Guiping Wang</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/vj2PVrsSn_w/s41598-018-24844-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Multiplexed imaging of high-density libraries of RNAs with MERFISH and expansion microscopy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Multiplexed imaging of high-density libraries of RNAs with MERFISH and expansion microscopy, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24844-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24844-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Multiplexed imaging of high-density libraries of RNAs with MERFISH and expansion microscopy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vj2PVrsSn_w&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: Multiplexed imaging of high-density libraries of RNAs with MERFISH and expansion microscopy</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24844-8</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162dad8751f:3ea39d8:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Multiplexed imaging of high-density libraries of RNAs with MERFISH and expansion microscopy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Multiplexed imaging of high-density libraries of RNAs with MERFISH and expansion microscopy, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24844-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24844-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Multiplexed imaging of high-density libraries of RNAs with MERFISH and expansion microscopy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vj2PVrsSn_w&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524090041631</crawled><fingerprint>21b173f5</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24844-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24844-8</originId><published>1524121200000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Dongshi Chen, Jingshan Tong, Liheng Yang, Liang Wei, Donna B.

We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district.

Background &lt;p&gt;The use of iodine-based contrast agents entails the risk of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Radiocontrast agents elicit the third most common cause of nephropathy among hospitalized patients, accounting for 11–12% of cases. CIN is connected with clinically significant consequences, including increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of complications, potential need for dialysis, and increased mortality rate. The number of in-hospital examinations using iodine-based contrast media has been significantly increasing over the last decade. In order to protect patients from possible complications of such examinations, new biomarkers are needed that are able to predict a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Urinary and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations are influenced by renal function. Urinary cGMP is primarily of renal cellular origin. Therefore, we assessed if urinary cGMP concentration may predict major adverse renal events (MARE) after contrast media exposure during coronary angiography.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Urine samples were prospectively collected from non-randomized consecutive patients with either diabetes or preexisting impaired kidney function receiving intra-arterial contrast medium (CM) for emergent or elective coronary angiography at the Charité Campus Mitte, University Hospital Berlin. Urinary cGMP concentration in spot urine was analyzed 24 hours after CM exposure. Patients were followed up over 90 days for occurrence of death, initiation of dialysis, doubling of plasma creatinine concentration or MARE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 289 consecutive patients were included into the study. Urine cGMP/creatinine ratio 24 hours before CM exposure expressed as mean±SD was predictive for the need of dialysis (no dialysis: 89.77±92.85 μM/mM, n = 277; need for dialysis: 140.3±82.90 μM/mM, n = 12, p = 0.008), death (no death during follow-up: 90.60±92.50 μM/mM, n = 280; death during follow-up: 169.88±81.52 μM/mM, n = 9; p = 0.002), and the composite endpoint MARE (no MARE: 86.02±93.17 μM/mM, n = 271; MARE: 146.64±74.68 μM/mM, n = 18, p&amp;lt;0.001) during the follow-up of 90 days after contrast media application. cGMP/creatinine ratio stayed significantly increased at values exceeding 120 μM/mM in patients who developed MARE, required dialysis or died.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary cGMP/creatinine ratio ≥ 120 μM/mM before CM exposure is a promising biomarker for the need of dialysis and all-cause mortality 90 days after CM exposure in patients with preexisting renal impairment or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Urinary cGMP predicts major adverse renal events in patients with mild renal impairment and/or diabetes mellitus before exposure to contrast medium</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d0:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lyubov Chaykovska, Fabian Heunisch, Gina von Einem, Carl-Friedrich Hocher, Oleg Tsuprykov, Mira Pavkovic, Peter Sandner, Axel Kretschmer, Chang Chu, Saban Elitok, Johannes-Peter Stasch, Berthold Hocher&lt;/p&gt;

The chemotaxis of HNSCC CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells was reduced in the presence of adenosine, and the effect was greater on HNSCC CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells than on healthy donor (HD) CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells.

We instead detected a decrease in KCa3.1 channel activity, but not expression, in HNSCC CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Activation of KCa3.1 channels by 1-EBIO restored the ability of HNSCC CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells to chemotax in the presence of adenosine. Our data highlight the mechanism underlying the increased sensitivity of HNSCC CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells to adenosine and the potential therapeutic benefit of KCa3.1 channel activators, which could increase infiltration of these T cells into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524594130919</crawled><fingerprint>db78d8a5</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/527/eaaq1616.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/527/eaaq1616?rss=1</originId><published>1524592205000</published><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/527/eaaq1616?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524690000000</updated><author><name>Nik Tuzov</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196058</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nik Tuzov&lt;/p&gt;
Any single nucleotide variant detection study could benefit from a fast and cheap method of measuring the quality of variant call list. It is advantageous to be able to see how the call list quality is affected by different variant filtering thresholds and other adjustments to the study parameters. Here we look into a possibility of estimating the proportion of true positives in a single nucleotide variant call list for human data. Using whole-exome and whole-genome gold standard data sets for training, we focus on building a generic model that only relies on information available from any variant caller. We assess and compare the performance of different candidate models based on their practical accuracy. We find that the generic model delivers decent accuracy most of the time. Further, we conclude that its performance could be improved substantially by leveraging the variant quality metrics that are specific to each variant calling tool.</content></content><title>A framework for the estimation of the proportion of true discoveries in single nucleotide variant detection studies for human data</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67ab:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nik Tuzov&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.44; p&amp;lt;0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45–5.62; p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals. A reduction in IFH claims in the ED and a reduction in the number of patients with access to a family physician also suggests inadequate primary care for this population, yet this was not reflected in the follow-up advice offered by ED physicians to patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Use of the emergency department by refugees under the Interim Federal Health Program: A health records review</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e8:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Bakewell, Sarah Addleman, Garth Dickinson, Venkatesh Thiruganasambandamoorthy&lt;/p&gt;

Bifunctional precatalysts were designed with tridentate ligands and potentially hemilabile heterocyclic spacers, expected to be suitable for the binding of pi-acidic metals such as copper (I) and silver (I). The structures of the designed catalysts were computed using density functional theory (DFT), and the relative energies of putative catalytic intermediates were estimated. The calculated free energy changes upon carbon–carbon bond formation were used to prioritize catalyst designs, and several modular precatalysts were selected and prepared, with a focus on thiazole-containing systems synthesized via a 9-step sequence. Catalysts were screened for the direct addition of aldehydes and ketones to several internal and terminal alkynes. The precatalysts were combined with several different transition metal salts, and their structures studied with 1H NMR and x-ray crystallography. Despite the lack of observed intermolecular reactions, DFT calculations of putative catalyst intermediates appears to be a promising strategy for the design and prioritization of bifunctional catalysts for C–C bond formation, and the combined results suggest that more rigid complexes may be necessary to catalyze direct intermolecular additions of aldehydes/ketones to alkynes.</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/DFT-Assisted_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Bifunctional_copper_I_Catalysts_for_the_Direct_Intermolecular_Addition_of_Aldehydes_and_Ketones_to_Alkynes/6163430</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl></origin><title>DFT-Assisted Design and Evaluation of Bifunctional copper(I) Catalysts for the Direct Intermolecular Addition of Aldehydes and Ketones to Alkynes</title><crawled>1524230456242</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_162e33703b2:4b17e2c:34f43e70</id><description>Bifunctional catalysts containing discrete metal pi-acid and amine sites were designed and investigated for the direct intermolecular addition of aldehydes and ketones to unactivated alkynes.

The structures of the designed catalysts were computed using density functional theory (DFT), and the relative energies of putative catalytic intermediates were estimated. The calculated free energy changes upon carbon–carbon bond formation were used to prioritize catalyst designs, and several modular precatalysts were selected and prepared, with a focus on thiazole-containing systems synthesized via a 9-step sequence. Catalysts were screened for the direct addition of aldehydes and ketones to several internal and terminal alkynes. The precatalysts were combined with several different transition metal salts, and their structures studied with 1H NMR and x-ray crystallography. Despite the lack of observed intermolecular reactions, DFT calculations of putative catalyst intermediates appears to be a promising strategy for the design and prioritization of bifunctional catalysts for C–C bond formation, and the combined results suggest that more rigid complexes may be necessary to catalyze direct intermolecular additions of aldehydes/ketones to alkynes.</description><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>bba679ef</fingerprint><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/DFT-Assisted_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Bifunctional_copper_I_Catalysts_for_the_Direct_Intermolecular_Addition_of_Aldehydes_and_Ketones_to_Alkynes/6163430</originId><published>1524182400000</published><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/DFT-Assisted_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Bifunctional_copper_I_Catalysts_for_the_Direct_Intermolecular_Addition_of_Aldehydes_and_Ketones_to_Alkynes/6163430</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Walhout, A.

This study aimed to investigate the histopathological changes in the patellofemoral joint using a rat model of osteoarthritis that was induced using monosodium iodoacetate, and to establish a novel model of patellofemoral osteoarthritis in a rat model using histopathological analysis. Sixty male rats were used. Osteoarthritis was induced through a single intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate in both knee joints. Animals were equally divided into two experimental groups based on the monosodium iodoacetate dose: 0.2 mg and 1.0 mg. Histopathological changes in the articular cartilage of the patellofemoral joint and the infrapatellar fat pad were examined at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after the monosodium iodoacetate injection. In the 1.0-mg group, the representative histopathological findings of osteoarthritis were observed in the articular cartilage of the patellofemoral joint over time. Additionally, the Osteoarthritis Research Society International scores of the patellofemoral joint increased over time. The synovitis scores of the infrapatellar fat pad in both groups were highest at 3 days, and then the values decreased over time. The fibrosis score of the infrapatellar fat pad in the 1.0-mg group increased with time, whereas the fibrosis score in the 0.2-mg group remained low. Representative histopathological findings of osteoarthritis were observed in the articular cartilage of the patellofemoral joint in a rat model of osteoarthritis induced using monosodium iodoacetate. With appropriate selection, this model may be regarded as an ideal patellofemoral osteoarthritis model.</content></content><title>Induction of osteoarthritis by injecting monosodium iodoacetate into the patellofemoral joint of an experimental rat model</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefbd:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ikufumi Takahashi, Taro Matsuzaki, Hiroshi Kuroki, Masahiro Hoso&lt;/p&gt;

The intense use of herbicides for weed control in agriculture causes selection pressure on soil microbiota and water ecosystems, possibly resulting in changes to microbial processes, such as biogeochemical cycles. These xenobiotics may increase the production of reactive oxygen species and consequently affect the survival of microorganisms, which need to develop strategies to adapt to these conditions and maintain their ecological functionality. This study analyzed the adaptive responses of bacterial isolates belonging to the same species, originating from two different environments (water and soil), and subjected to selection pressure by herbicides. The effects of herbicide Callisto and its active ingredient, mesotrione, induced different adaptation strategies on the cellular, enzymatic, and structural systems of two &lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&lt;/i&gt; isolates obtained from these environments. The lipid saturation patterns observed may have affected membrane permeability in response to this herbicide. Moreover, this may have led to different levels of responses involving superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, and enzyme polymorphisms. Due to these response systems, the strain isolated from water exhibited higher growth rates than did the soil strain, in evaluations made in oligotrophic culture media, which would be more like that found in semi-pristine aquatic environments. The influence of the intracellular oxidizing environments, which changed the mode of degradation of mesotrione in our experimental model and produced different metabolites, can also be observed in soil and water at sites related to agriculture. Since the different metabolites may present different levels of toxicity, we suggest that this fact should be considered in studies on the fate of agrochemicals in different environments.</content></content><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&amp;lt;/i&gt; strains derived from water and soil exhibit differential responses to the herbicide mesotrione</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b4:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatiane Dobrzanski, Fernanda Gravina, Bruna Steckling, Luiz R.

The powerful HiSeq X sequencers with their patterned flowcell technology and fast turnaround times are instrumental for many large-scale genomic and epigenomic studies. However, assessment of DNA methylation by sodium bisulfite treatment results in sequencing libraries of low diversity, which may impact data quality and yield. In this report we assess the quality of WGBS data generated on the HiSeq X system in comparison with data generated on the HiSeq 2500 system and the newly released NovaSeq system. We report a systematic issue with low basecall quality scores assigned to guanines in the second read of WGBS when using certain Real Time Analysis (RTA) software versions on the HiSeq X sequencer, reminiscent of an issue that was previously reported with certain HiSeq 2500 software versions. However, with the HD.3.4.0 /RTA 2.7.7 software upgrade for the HiSeq X system, we observed an overall improved quality and yield of the WGBS data generated, which in turn empowers cost-effective and high quality DNA methylation studies.</content></content><title>Data quality of whole genome bisulfite sequencing on Illumina platforms</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccbe:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amanda Raine, Ulrika Liljedahl, Jessica Nordlund&lt;/p&gt;

As persons with stroke are surviving longer, monitoring and managing their quality of life is becoming important. We reviewed the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) in order to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in stroke survivors as measured by the Euro Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D), and to find out influencing factors. A total of 42,500 subjects were enrolled in the KNHANES, and 575 of them were persons with stroke. The EQ-5D index was lower in persons with stroke than those without stroke, when adjusted for age and sex (with stroke: 0.757±0.012, without stroke: 0.948±0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .0001). Dimension-specific influencing factors of HRQoL were observed in persons with stroke; mobility problems increased with old age; self-care problems increased with old age and depression; usual activity problems increased with old age, low income, absence of economic activity, and depression; pain/discomfort problems increased with low income. The EQ-5D index was lower in stroke survivors with older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lack of regular exercise. This is the first study to utilize nationally representative data of the Korean population to investigate the effect of stroke on HRQoL and explore the dimension-specific influencing factors. Further development of rehabilitative interventions for post-stroke depression, vocational rehabilitation, and tailored programs for encouraging physical activity may be needed to improve the HRQoL in Korean stroke survivors.</content></content><title>Health-related quality of life and related factors in stroke survivors: Data from Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2008 to 2014</title><unread>False</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c0:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by SuYeon Kwon, Ji-Hong Park, Won-Seok Kim, Kyungdo Han, Yookyung Lee, Nam-Jong Paik&lt;/p&gt;

The hemodynamic effects of intravenous (IV) paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are unknown. We performed a prospective single center placebo controlled randomized study with parallel group design in adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Participants received paracetamol (1 gram) IV or placebo (an equal volume of 0.9% saline) preoperatively followed by two postoperative doses 6 hours apart. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in systolic (SBP) 30 minutes after the preoperative infusion, analysed using an ANCOVA model. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB), and other key hemodynamic variables after each infusion. All other endpoints were analysed using random-effect generalized least squares regression modelling with individual patients treated as random effects. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to receive paracetamol (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). Post preoperative infusion, paracetamol decreased SBP by a mean (SD) of 13 (18) mmHg, p = 0.02, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (11) mmHg with saline. Paracetamol decreased MAP and DBP by a mean (SD) of 9 (12) mmHg and 8 (9) mmHg (p = 0.01 and 0.02), respectively, compared to a mean (SD) of 1 (8) mmHg and 0 (6) mmHg with placebo. Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in pressure or flow based hemodynamic parameters in both groups. This study provides high quality evidence that the administration of IV paracetamol in patients undergoing cardiac surgery causes a transient decrease in preoperative blood pressure when administered before surgery but no adverse hemodynamic effects when administered in the postoperative setting.</content></content><title>The hemodynamic effects of intravenous paracetamol (acetaminophen) vs normal saline in cardiac surgery patients: A single center placebo controlled randomized study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aec:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Chiam, Rinaldo Bellomo, Leonid Churilov, Laurence Weinberg&lt;/p&gt;

Despite originating from different technologies, cell populations could be matched across data sets, allowing the assignment of clusters to reference maps and their annotation.</description><crawled>1525710322079</crawled><fingerprint>7ee0bd83</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/07/314831</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314831v1?rss=1</originId><published>1525676400000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314831v1?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00033/20180419/images/medium/ct-2018-00033n_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00033&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The precise sizing of the stent graft in thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) affects aortic remodeling and hence, further outcome. Covering the proximal entry tear is essential for successful treatment of Type B aortic dissection. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) enables real-time aortic diameter assessment, and is especially useful when computed tomography (CT) image quality is poor. IVUS, however, is not routinely utilized due to cost inefficiency. We investigated the impact of IVUS-assisted stent graft sizing on aortic remodeling in TEVAR. In this single-center retrospective study we evaluated patients with Type B aortic dissection undergoing both CT and IVUS before TEVAR. We assessed the aortic diameter at the level of the left subclavian artery via both methods before stent implantation and analyzed due to which method the implanted stent graft was chosen, retrospectively. To determine the degrees of aortic remodeling involved, we evaluated true lumen and false lumen diameters, and total aortic remodeling in CT. We analyzed 45 patients with Type B aortic dissection undergoing TEVAR. The mean ages were 66.9±10.0 years fo0072 IVUS (n = 20) and 62.3±14.2 years for CT-assisted TEVAR (n = 25; p = 0.226). The follow-up time for both groups did not differ between the two groups (IVUS: 22.9±23.1 months, CT: 25.6±23.0 months; p = 0.700). While both methods were associated with advantages regarding aortic remodeling, IVUS-assisted sizing yielded a greater increase in true lumen (30.4±6.2 vs. 25.6±5.3; p = 0.008) and reductions in false lumen (14.4±8.5 vs. 23.9±9.3; p = 0.001) and total aortic diameter (35.5±6.0 vs. 39.9±8.1; p = 0.045). IVUS-guided stent graft sizing in Type B aortic dissection shows beneficial effects on aortic remodeling and might be of additional advantage in aortic diseases, especially when CT image quality is poor.</content></content><title>Intravascular ultrasound assisted sizing in thoracic endovascular aortic repair improves aortic remodeling in Type B aortic dissection</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935ce:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julia Lortz, Konstantinos Tsagakis, Christos Rammos, Michael Horacek, Thomas Schlosser, Heinz Jakob, Tienush Rassaf, Rolf Alexander Jánosi&lt;/p&gt;

The understanding on the roles of obesity and lifestyle behaviors in predicting executive function of adolescents has been limited. Low executive function proficiency may have adverse effects on adolescents’ school academic performance. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between BMI-for-age and multiple lifestyle behaviors (operationalized as meal consumption, physical activity, and sleep quality) with executive function (operationalized as inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) on a sample of Malaysian adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 513). Participants were recruited from two randomly selected schools in the state of Selangor in Malaysia. Using a self-administered questionnaire, parent participants provided information concerning their sociodemographic data, whereas adolescent participants provided information regarding their meal consumptions, physical activity, and sleep quality. The modified Harvard step test was used to assess adolescents’ aerobic fitness, while Stroop color-word, digit span, and trail-making tests were used to assess adolescents’ inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, respectively. Three separate hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for each outcome namely, inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. After adjusted for sociodemographic factors and BMI-for-age, differential predictors of inhibition and working memory were found. Habitual sleep efficiency significantly and positively predicted inhibition. Regular dinner intakes, physical activity levels, and sleep quality significantly and positively predicted working memory. Household income emerged as a consistent predictor for all executive function domains. In conclusion, an increased trend of obesity and unhealthy lifestyles among adolescents were found to be associated with poorer executive function. Regular dinner intakes, higher physical activity levels and better sleep quality predicted better executive function despite the inverse relationship between obesity and executive function. Future studies may explore how lifestyle modifications can optimize the development of executive function in adolescents as well as relieve the burden of obesity.</content></content><title>Obesity and unhealthy lifestyle associated with poor executive function among Malaysian adolescents</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334415a:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joyce Ying Hui Tee, Wan Ying Gan, Kit-Aun Tan, Yit Siew Chin&lt;/p&gt;

In anaplastic thyroid cancer C643 cells, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) attenuates migration by activating the S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor and the Rho-ROCK pathway. In the present study, we show that stimulating C643 cells with S1P decreases the expression, secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and to a lesser extent MMP9. Using receptor-specific antagonists, and S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; siRNA, we showed that the inhibition of expression of MMP2 is mediated through S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, S1P inhibited calpain activity, and inhibiting calpain pharmacologically, inhibited the effect of S1P on MMP2 expression and activity, and on MMP9 activity. S1P treatment increased Rho activity, and by incubating cells with the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase or the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, the S1P-induced inhibition of invasion and MMP2 expression and activity was abolished. We conclude that S1P attenuates the invasion of C643 cells by activating S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the Rho-ROCK pathway, by decreasing calpain activity, and by decreasing the expression, secretion and activity of MMP2 and, to a lesser extent, MMP9.

NKp46, a natural killer (NK) cell–activating receptor, is involved in NK cell cytotoxicity against virus-infected cells or tumor cells. However, the role of NKp46 in other NKp46&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; non-NK innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations has not yet been characterized. Here, an NKp46 deficiency model of natural cytotoxicity receptor 1 (&lt;i&gt;Ncr1&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;gfp/gfp&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ncr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;gfp/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, i.e., homozygous and heterozygous knockout (KO), was used to explore the role of NKp46 in regulating the development of the NKp46&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILCs. Surprisingly, our studies demonstrated that homozygous NKp46 deficiency resulted in a nearly complete depletion of the ILC1 subset (ILC1) of group 1 ILCs, and heterozygote KO decreased the number of cells in the ILC1 subset. Moreover, transplantation studies confirmed that ILC1 development depends on NKp46 and that the dependency is cell intrinsic. Interestingly, however, the cell depletion specifically occurred in the ILC1 subset but not in the other ILCs, including ILC2s, ILC3s, and NK cells. Thus, our studies reveal that NKp46 selectively participates in the regulation of ILC1 development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oHgr98r15pw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Dependence of innate lymphoid cell 1 development on NKp46</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16308d599a6:5375ee:a96d255</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yufeng Wang, Wenjuan Dong, Yibo Zhang, Michael A.

NKp46, a natural killer (NK) cell–activating receptor, is involved in NK cell cytotoxicity against virus-infected cells or tumor cells. However, the role of NKp46 in other NKp46&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; non-NK innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations has not yet been characterized. Here, an NKp46 deficiency model of natural cytotoxicity receptor 1 (&lt;i&gt;Ncr1&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;gfp/gfp&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ncr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;gfp/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, i.e., homozygous and heterozygous knockout (KO), was used to explore the role of NKp46 in regulating the development of the NKp46&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ILCs. Surprisingly, our studies demonstrated that homozygous NKp46 deficiency resulted in a nearly complete depletion of the ILC1 subset (ILC1) of group 1 ILCs, and heterozygote KO decreased the number of cells in the ILC1 subset. Moreover, transplantation studies confirmed that ILC1 development depends on NKp46 and that the dependency is cell intrinsic. Interestingly, however, the cell depletion specifically occurred in the ILC1 subset but not in the other ILCs, including ILC2s, ILC3s, and NK cells. Thus, our studies reveal that NKp46 selectively participates in the regulation of ILC1 development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oHgr98r15pw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524861606310</crawled><fingerprint>3db4de61</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004867</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004867</originId><published>1524862800000</published><recrawled>1524861629091</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004867</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 15, Page 869-873, June 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24980?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/15&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, Page 869-873, June 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Issue Information</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24980?af=R</link><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162d60d632c:36afe68:9f3b30f2</id><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 15, Page 869-873, June 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1524009624364</crawled><fingerprint>e555ad7f</fingerprint><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24980?af=R</originId><published>1523944685000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01663/20180420/images/medium/jp-2018-01663e_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01663&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Reconfigurations of synchronized large-scale networks are thought to be central neural mechanisms that support cognition and behavior in the human brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings together with recent advances in network analysis now allow for sub-second snapshots of such networks. In the present study, we compared frequency-resolved functional connectivity patterns underlying reading of single words and visual recognition of symbol strings. Word reading emphasized coherence in a left-lateralized network with nodes in classical perisylvian language regions, whereas symbol processing recruited a bilateral network, including connections between frontal and parietal regions previously associated with spatial attention and visual working memory. Our results illustrate the flexible nature of functional networks, whereby processing of different form categories, written words vs. symbol strings, leads to the formation of large-scale functional networks that operate at distinct oscillatory frequencies and incorporate task-relevant regions. These results suggest that category-specific processing should be viewed not so much as a local process but as a distributed neural process implemented in signature networks. For words, increased coherence was detected particularly in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and high gamma (60–90 Hz) frequency bands, whereas increased coherence for symbol strings was observed in the high beta (21–29 Hz) and low gamma (30–45 Hz) frequency range. These findings attest to the role of coherence in specific frequency bands as a general mechanism for integrating stimulus-dependent information across brain regions.</content></content><title>Large-scale functional networks connect differently for processing words and symbol strings</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a190:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mia Liljeström, Johanna Vartiainen, Jan Kujala, Riitta Salmelin&lt;/p&gt;

Because punishments are expected to give offenders what they deserve proportionally to the severity of their offenses, the punishment of an entire group because of the misdeed of a few of its members is generally considered as unfair. Group entitativity might increase support for such collective punishment, because members of highly entitative groups are perceived as more similar and interchangeable. We designed three experiments comparing support for third-party collective punishment of low versus high entitative groups. As comparison base-rate, we included conditions in which participants punish an individual wrongdoer (Experiments 1 &amp;amp; 2). Results show that although support for individual punishment is higher than support for collective punishment, this difference was reduced (Experiment 1) or absent (Experiment 2) when the group was highly entitative. Experiment 3 replicated the increasing effect of group entitativity on support for collective punishment. We conclude that group entitativity increases the likelihood of an entire group being treated as a single unit, facilitating collective punishment when a few group members commit an offense.</content></content><title>Why we sometimes punish the innocent: The role of group entitativity in collective punishment</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae2:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Pereira, Jan-Willem van Prooijen&lt;/p&gt;

The FRH (frequency-interacting RNA helicase) protein is the &lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&lt;/i&gt; homolog of yeast Mtr4, an essential RNA helicase that plays a central role in RNA metabolism as an activator of the nuclear RNA exosome. FRH is also a required component of the circadian clock, mediating protein interactions that result in the rhythmic repression of gene expression. Here we show that FRH unwinds RNA substrates &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with a kinetic profile similar to Mtr4, indicating that while FRH has acquired additional functionality, its core helicase function remains intact. In contrast with the earlier FRH structures, a new crystal form of FRH results in an ATP binding site that is undisturbed by crystal contacts and adopts a conformation consistent with nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Strikingly, this new FRH structure adopts an arch domain conformation that is dramatically altered from previous structures. Comparison of the existing FRH structures reveals conserved hinge points that appear to facilitate arch motion. Regions in the arch have been previously shown to mediate a variety of protein-protein interactions critical for RNA surveillance and circadian clock functions. The conformational changes highlighted in the FRH structures provide a platform for investigating the relationship between arch dynamics and Mtr4/FRH function.</content></content><title>Structure of frequency-interacting RNA helicase from &amp;lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&amp;lt;/i&gt; reveals high flexibility in a domain critical for circadian rhythm and RNA surveillance</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a182:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yalemi Morales, Keith J.

There is evidence that altering stress mindset—the belief that stress is enhancing vs. debilitating—can change cognitive, affective and physiological responses to stress. However individual differences in responsiveness to stress mindset manipulations have not been explored. Given the previously established role of catecholamines in both placebo effects and stress, we hypothesized that genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines, would moderate responses to an intervention intended to alter participants’ mindsets about stress. Participants (N = 107) were exposed to a stress mindset manipulation (videos highlighting either the enhancing or debilitating effects of stress) prior to engaging in a Trier Social Stress task and subsequent cognitive tasks. The associations of the &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; rs4680 polymorphism with the effect of stress mindset video manipulations on cognitive and affective responses were examined. Genetic variation at rs4680 modified the effects of stress mindset on affective and cognitive responses to stress. Individuals homozygous for rs4680 low-activity allele (met/met) were responsive to the stress-is-enhancing mindset manipulation as indicated by greater increases in positive affect, improved cognitive functioning, and happiness bias in response to stress. Conversely, individuals homozygous for the high-activity allele (val/val) were not as responsive to the stress mindset manipulation. These results suggest that responses to stress mindset intervention may vary with &lt;i&gt;COMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype. These findings contribute to the understanding of gene by environment interactions for mindset interventions and stress reactivity and therefore warrant further investigations.</content></content><title>Catechol-O-Methyltransferase moderates effect of stress mindset on affect and cognition</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fa:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alia J.

We implement Learning and Imputation for Mass-spec Bias Reduction (LIMBR) software, which builds on previous block based models of batch effects and includes features specific to time series and circadian studies. To aid in the analysis of time series proteomics experiments, which are often plagued with missing data points, we also integrate an imputation system. By building LIMBR for imputation and time series tailored bias modeling into one straightforward software package, we expect that the quality and ease of large-scale proteomics and genomics time series experiments will be significantly increased.</description><crawled>1523721995219</crawled><fingerprint>76bad544</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/14/301242</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301242v1?rss=1</originId><published>1523689200000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301242v1?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>17</engagement><author><name>Ferrarelli, L.

Although exercise is effective in improving obesity and hyperinsulinemia, the exact influence of exercise on the capillary density of skeletal muscles remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low-intensity exercise training on metabolism in obesity with hyperinsulinemia, focusing specifically on the capillary density within the skeletal muscle. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats were used as animal models of obesity with hyperinsulinemia, whereas Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats served as controls (no obesity, no hyperinsulinemia). The animals were randomly assigned to either non-exercise or exercise groups (treadmill running for 60 min/day, for 4 weeks). The exercise groups were further divided into subgroups according to training mode: single bout (60 min, daily) vs. multiple bout (three bouts of 20 min, daily). Fasting insulin levels were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats. Among OLETF rats, there were no significant differences in fasting glucose levels between the exercise and the non-exercise groups, but the fasting insulin levels were significantly lower in the exercise group. Body weight and triacylglycerol levels in the liver were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats; however, among OLETF rats, these levels were significantly lower in the exercise than in the non-exercise group. The capillary-to-fiber ratio of the soleus muscle was significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats; however, among OLETF rats, the ratio was lower in the exercise group than in the non-exercise group. No significant differences in any of the studied parameters were noted between the single-bout and multiple-bout exercise training modes among either OLETF or LETO rats. These results suggest that low-intensity exercise training improves insulin sensitivity and fatty liver. Additionally, the fact that attenuation of excessive capillarization in the skeletal muscle of OLETF rats was accompanied by improvement in increased body weight.</content></content><title>Changes in lipid metabolism and capillary density of the skeletal muscle following low-intensity exercise training in a rat model of obesity with hyperinsulinemia</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a197:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naoto Fujita, Saki Aono, Kohei Karasaki, Fumi Sera, Tomoyuki Kurose, Hidemi Fujino, Susumu Urakawa&lt;/p&gt;

Intralesional (IL) injection of Rose Bengal (PV-10) induces regression of injected and uninjected lesions in several murine tumor models. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor response of combining IL PV-10 with blockade of the PD-1 / PD-L1 pathway and the role of immune cell populations in eliciting this response. To investigate the role of T cell subsets in mediating an immune response, B16 or M05 melanoma-bearing mice received combination therapy as well as CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; depleting antibodies. Tumor growth was measured. T cells were collected from spleens or tumors, and phenotype, activation markers, and reactivity were measured. Splenocytes from mice treated with combination therapy had increased OVA antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in M05-tumor-bearing mice. Depletion of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells or regulatory T cells (Tregs) in combination with IL PV-10 and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment resulted in an enhanced anti-tumor effect. Treatment with CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; depleting antibody abrogated anti-tumor immunity. These results support a clinical study for the safety and anti-tumor immune responses with combination therapy of IL PV-10 and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.</content></content><title>T cell mediated immunity after combination therapy with intralesional PV-10 and blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in a murine melanoma model</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67aa:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hao Liu, Amy Weber, Jennifer Morse, Krithika Kodumudi, Ellen Scott, John Mullinax, Amod A.

Recent studies have suggested reduced independent and sensitive parameter sets for stabilometry measurements based on correlation and variance analyses. However, the reliability of these recommended parameter sets has not been studied in the literature or not in every stance type used in stabilometry assessments, for example, single leg stances. The goal of this study is to evaluate the test-retest reliability of different time-based and frequency-based parameters that are calculated from the center of pressure (CoP) during bipedal and single leg stance for 30- and 60-second measurement intervals. Thirty healthy subjects performed repeated standing trials in a bipedal stance with eyes open and eyes closed conditions and in a single leg stance with eyes open for 60 seconds. A force distribution measuring plate was used to record the CoP. The reliability of the CoP parameters was characterized by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), coefficient of variation (CV) and CV compliance rate (CVCR). Based on the ICC, SEM and MDC results, many parameters yielded fair to good reliability values, while the CoP path length yielded the highest reliability (smallest ICC &gt; 0.67 (0.54–0.79), largest SEM% = 19.2%). Usually, frequency type parameters and extreme value parameters yielded poor reliability values. There were differences in the reliability of the maximum CoP velocity (better with 30 seconds) and mean power frequency (better with 60 seconds) parameters between the different sampling intervals.</content></content><title>Reliability analysis of a sensitive and independent stabilometry parameter set</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344160:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gergely Nagymáté, Zsanett Orlovits, Rita M.

Explicit structural inference is one key point to improve the accuracy of scene parsing. Meanwhile, adversarial training method is able to reinforce spatial contiguity in output segmentations. To take both advantages of the structural learning and adversarial training simultaneously, we propose a novel deep learning network architecture called Structural Inference Embedded Adversarial Networks (SIEANs) for pixel-wise scene labeling. The generator of our SIEANs, a novel designed scene parsing network, makes full use of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks to learn the global contextual information of objects in four different directions from RGB-(D) images, which is able to describe the (three-dimensional) spatial distributions of objects in a more comprehensive and accurate way. To further improve the performance, we explore the adversarial training method to optimize the generator along with a discriminator, which can not only detect and correct higher-order inconsistencies between the predicted segmentations and corresponding ground truths, but also exploit full advantages of the generator by fine-tuning its parameters so as to obtain higher consistencies. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SIEANs is able to achieve a better performance on PASCAL VOC 2012, SIFT FLOW, PASCAL Person-Part, Cityscapes, Stanford Background, NYUDv2, and SUN-RGBD datasets compared to the most of state-of-the-art methods.</content></content><title>Structural inference embedded adversarial networks for scene parsing</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7137:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by ZeYu Wang, YanXia Wu, ShuHui Bu, PengCheng Han, GuoYin Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SIEANs is able to achieve a better performance on PASCAL VOC 2012, SIFT FLOW, PASCAL Person-Part, Cityscapes, Stanford Background, NYUDv2, and SUN-RGBD datasets compared to the most of state-of-the-art methods.</description><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>97df91ae</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</originId><published>1523566800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195114</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Bernd Kärcher</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/XSdJjwIDJIg/s41467-018-04068-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Formation and radiative forcing of contrail cirrus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formation and radiative forcing of contrail cirrus, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04068-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04068-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Condensation trails produced by jet aircraft contribute to anthropogenic climate change, yet the magnitude of their impact remains unclear.

Providing this type of reproducibility, however, is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally come in various versions.

Human beings are exposed to compressed air or a nitrogen-oxygen mixture, they will produce signs and symptoms of nitrogen narcosis such as amnesia or even loss of memory, which may be disappeared once back to the normobaric environment. This study was designed to investigate the effect of nitrogen narcosis induced by repetitive hyperbaric nitrogen-oxygen mixture exposure on long-term cognitive function in newborn mice and the underlying mechanisms. The electroencephalogram frequency was decreased while the amplitude was increased in a pressure-dependent manner during 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 MPa (million pascal) nitrogen-oxygen mixture exposures in adult mice. Nitrogen narcosis in postnatal days 7–9 mice but not in adult mice induced by repetitive hyperbaric exposure prolonged the latency to find the platform and decreased the number of platform-site crossovers during Morris water maze tests, and reduced the time in the center during the open field tests. An increase in the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in the hippocampus and cortex were observed immediately on the first day after hyperbaric exposure, and this lasted for seven days. Additionally, nitrogen narcosis induced loss of the dendritic spines but not of the neurons, which may mainly account for the cognitive dysfunction. Nitrogen narcosis induced long-term cognitive and emotional dysfunction in the postnatal mice but not in the adult mice, which may result from neuronal apoptosis and especially reduction of dendritic spines of neurons.</content></content><title>Nitrogen narcosis induced by repetitive hyperbaric nitrogen oxygen mixture exposure impairs long-term cognitive function in newborn mice</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefbc:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bin Peng, Shun-Hua Peng, Run-Ming Qu, Li-Hua Xu, Zheng-Lin Jiang&lt;/p&gt;

This study investigates the progress of highly cited research in China from 2001 to 2016 through the analysis of the Highly Cited database. The Highly Cited database, compiled by Clarivate Analytics, is comprised of the world’s most influential researchers in the 22 Essential Science Indicator fields as catalogued by the Web of Science. The database is considered an international standard for the measurement of national and institutional highly cited research output. Overall, we found a consistent and substantial increase in Highly Cited Researchers from China during the timespan. The Chinese institutions with the most Highly Cited Researchers- the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Zhejiang University, the University of Science and Technology of China, and BGI Shenzhen- are all top ten universities or primary government research institutions. Further evaluation of separate fields of research and government funding data from the National Natural Science Foundation of China revealed disproportionate growth efficiencies among the separate divisions of the National Natural Science Foundation. The most development occurred in the fields of Chemistry, Materials Sciences, and Engineering, whereas the least development occurred in Economics and Business, Health Sciences, and Life Sciences.</content></content><title>On the advancement of highly cited research in China: An analysis of the Highly Cited database</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907faf:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by John Tianci Li&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most ambitious endeavors in the field of diabetes technology is non-invasive glucose sensing. In the past decades, a number of different technologies have been assessed, but none of these have found its entry into general clinical use. We report on the development of a table-top confocal Raman spectrometer that was used in the home of patients with diabetes and operated for extended periods of time unsupervised and without recalibration. The system is based on measurement of glucose levels at a ‘critical depth’ in the skin, specifically in the interstitial fluid located below the stratum corneum but above the underlying adipose tissue layer. The region chosen for routine glucose measurements was the base of the thumb (the thenar). In a small clinical study, 35 patients with diabetes analyzed their interstitial fluid glucose for a period of 60 days using the new critical-depth Raman (CD-Raman) method and levels were correlated to reference capillary blood glucose values using a standard finger-stick and test strip product. The calibration of the CD-Raman system was stable for &gt; 10 days. Measurement performance for glucose levels present at, or below, a depth of ~250μm below the skin surface was comparable to that reported for currently available invasive continuous glucose monitors. In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home.</content></content><title>Critical-depth Raman spectroscopy enables home-use non-invasive glucose monitoring</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f78:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Signe M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Burden of disease studies intend to improve public health decision-making and to measure social and economic impact in population. The objective of this study was to describe the burden of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in Ecuador between 2011 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Five-year period morbidity and mortality data available from national agencies of statistics was analyzed to estimate the burden of disease attributable to acute respiratory infections. Cases and deaths registered were grouped according to their ICD-10 code into three diagnostic groups: Acute upper respiratory infections (J00-J06), Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), and Bronchitis and other acute lower respiratory infections (J20-J22, J85, J86). Disability-adjusted life years stratified by diagnostic and age group were calculated using the “DALY” package for R. The productivity loss in monetary terms was estimated using the human capital method.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Over the 5-year period studied there were a total of 14.84 million cases of acute respiratory infections, with 17 757 deaths reported (0.12%). The yearly burden of disease ranged between 98 944 to 118 651 disability-adjusted life years, with an estimated average loss of productivity of US$152.16 million (±19.6) per year. Approximately 99% of the burden can be attributed to years life lost due to premature mortality in population under 5 years old and over 60 years-old.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The burden of acute respiratory infections remained steady during the analyzed period.

Background &lt;p&gt;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects a large number of people throughout the world. Anxiety, depression and fatigue are common symptoms of SLE that substantially contribute to decreased quality of life. This study investigates the interplay between physical and psychiatric manifestations of lupus. To this end, an SLE patient cohort was examined for correlations between clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and psychological indicators.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy-two lupus patients were evaluated for psychological status using a battery of instruments, including assessments for fatigue (CFS &amp;amp; FSS), depression (HADS), anxiety (HADS), overall health (SF-36 &amp;amp; PSQI) and intimate relationship satisfaction (RAS &amp;amp; CSI). Scores from these assessments were correlated with lupus clinical profiles and laboratory test values.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of depression in the SLE patient cohort was 41.7%, as measured by the hospital depression and anxiety scale. The study identified that pain (p = 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.026), Chalder’s fatigue scale (p &amp;lt; 0.001), fatigue severity scale (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001) are all positively correlated with depression in SLE patients. Total complement (CH50) (p = 0.032), and SF-36 physical and mental characteristic assessments are negatively correlated with depression. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the disease related complaint alopecia (p = 0.008) and relationship assessment scale scores (p = 0.004) may also be correlated to depression in SLE patients. Multivariant scrutiny of the clinical and psychosocial characteristics identified the fatigue severity scale (p = 0.026), SF-36 physical function (p = 0.040), physical role function (0.030), and mental health (p = 0.002) as the best indicators directly correlated with depression for the SLE cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results reveal the influence of physical manifestations of lupus including fatigue, pain, body mass index and anxiety, as well as decreased physical and mental function, on depression. Fatigue is the strongest factor correlated with depression in SLE patients in the cohort.

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Hey1- and p53-dependent TrkC proapoptotic activity controls neuroblastoma growth</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f2:f3bf0074</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;
The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.

The stolbur phytoplasma vector &lt;i&gt;Hyalesthes obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; is generally considered as a polyphagous species associated with numerous wild and cultivated plants. However, recent research in southeastern Europe, the distribution centre of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt; and the area of most stolbur-inflicted crop diseases, points toward specific host-plant associations of the vector, indicating specific vector-based transmission routes. Here, we study the specificity of populations associated with four host-plants using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers, and we evaluate the evolution of host-shifts in &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;obsoletus&lt;/i&gt;. Host-plant use was confirmed for &lt;i&gt;Convolvulus arvensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Urtica dioica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitex agnus-castus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Crepis foetida&lt;/i&gt;.

The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been decreasing globally, but the growing effects of HCV-related morbidity and mortality remain of concern. Advances in curative medicine, involving direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), have led many countries to aim to eradicate HCV. Information on epidemiology and disease burden is essential for national policy development. Thus, this study aimed to determine the HCV-related hepatic disease burden in areas of Thailand with high and average HCV prevalence in order to extrapolate the viral burden across Thailand. Patients previously diagnosed as positive for anti-HCV antibodies were recruited to assess chronic HCV infection (CHC) status, liver function, HCV-RNA level and hepatic fibrosis. The number of patients eligible for Universal Health Coverage (UC) scheme and the approximately required expenditure on interferon (IFN)-based treatment were estimated. In areas of both high (12%) and average (2%) HCV viremic prevalence, over half of the patients (52.2% to 62.5%) had advanced liver fibrosis (F3 and F4). A striking percentage of patients with F4 (38.9%) were found in the high-prevalence area, while comparable proportions of advanced liver fibrosis presented in the two areas and disease burden peaked at 50–59 years. Under the current UC program treatment scenario, 78–83% of CHC patients with stage F2–F4 fibrosis were eligible for treatment. The estimated expenditure required for overall CHC treatment across the whole country was 1,240 million USD at this current status, but the declining cost of generic DAA-based therapy may reduce the requirement to &amp;lt;90 million USD. This study provides information on the estimated number of CHC patients, liver disease burden and expenditure requirements for Thailand. To eliminate HCV by 2030, proactive government strategies raising public health to minimize transmission and emphasizing targeted screen-and-treatment programs, novel therapeutic guideline development for decentralizing treatment, and effective budget allocation are urgently needed.</content></content><title>Liver disease burden and required treatment expenditures for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Thailand: Implications for HCV elimination in the new therapeutic era, a population-based study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907faa:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rujipat Wasitthankasem, Preeyaporn Vichaiwattana, Nipaporn Siripon, Nawarat Posuwan, Chompoonut Auphimai, Sirapa Klinfueng, Napha Thanetkongtong, Viboonsak Vuthitanachot, Supapith Saiyatha, Chaiwat Thongmai, Saowakon Sochoo, Natnada Pongsuwan, Kittiyod Poovorawan, Pisit Tangkijvanich, Yong Poovorawan&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are regarded as the cornerstone of conventional treatment for AS. However little is known about concomitant NSAID use during treatment (with TNF-α inhibitors) in daily clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Consecutive patients from the GLAS cohort were included. NSAID use and ASAS-NSAID index were evaluated at group level and at individual patient level during 52 weeks of follow-up. Analyses were stratified for treatment regimen. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to evaluate NSAID use in relation to assessments of disease activity over time. In patients starting TNF-α inhibitors (n = 254), 79% used NSAIDs at baseline and this proportion decreased significantly to 38% at 52 weeks. ASAS-NSAID index also decreased significantly from median 65 to 0. In patients on conventional treatment (n = 139), 74% used NSAIDs at baseline with median ASAS-NSAID index of 50 and this remained stable during follow-up. At each follow-up visit, approximately half of the patients changed their type or dose of NSAIDs. GEE analysis over time showed that NSAID use was associated with AS disease activity score (p&amp;lt;0.05). This relation was more pronounced in patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors compared to conventional treatment (B = 0.825 vs. B = 0.250).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this observational cohort of established AS patients, there was no difference in baseline NSAID use between patients with and without indication for TNF-α inhibitors. NSAID use decreased significantly after starting TNF-α inhibitors. During conventional treatment, NSAID use remained stable at group level.

Managing landscape connectivity is a widely recognized overarching strategy for conserving biodiversity in human-impacted landscapes. However, planning the conservation and management of landscape connectivity of multiple and ecologically distinct species is still challenging. Here we provide a spatially-explicit framework which identifies and prioritizes connectivity conservation and restoration actions for species with distinct habitat affinities. Specifically, our study system comprised three groups of common bird species, forest-specialists, farmland-specialists, and generalists, populating a highly heterogeneous agricultural countryside in the southwestern Iberian Peninsula. We first performed a comprehensive analysis of the environmental variables underlying the distributional patterns of each bird species to reveal generalities in their guild-specific responses to landscape structure. Then, we identified sites which could be considered pivotal in maintaining current levels of landscape connectivity for the three bird guilds simultaneously, as well as the number and location of sites that need to be restored to maximize connectivity levels. Interestingly, we found that a small number of sites defined the shortest connectivity paths for the three bird guilds simultaneously, and were therefore considered key for conservation. Moreover, an even smaller number of sites were identified as critical to expand the landscape connectivity at maximum for the regional bird assemblage as a whole. Our spatially-explicit framework can provide valuable decision-making support to conservation practitioners aiming to identify key connectivity and restoration sites, a particularly urgent task in rapidly changing landscapes such as agroecosystems.</content></content><title>A distribution-oriented approach to support landscape connectivity for ecologically distinct bird species</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd7a:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by José M.

Plastic pollution has been well documented in natural environments, including the open waters and sediments within lakes and rivers, the open ocean and even the air, but less attention has been paid to synthetic polymers in human consumables. Since multiple toxicity studies indicate risks to human health when plastic particles are ingested, more needs to be known about the presence and abundance of anthropogenic particles in human foods and beverages. This study investigates the presence of anthropogenic particles in 159 samples of globally sourced tap water, 12 brands of Laurentian Great Lakes beer, and 12 brands of commercial sea salt. Of the tap water samples analyzed, 81% were found to contain anthropogenic particles. The majority of these particles were fibers (98.3%) between 0.1–5 mm in length. The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99% were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg. Based on consumer guidelines, our results indicate the average person ingests over 5,800 particles of synthetic debris from these three sources annually, with the largest contribution coming from tap water (88%).</content></content><title>Anthropogenic contamination of tap water, beer, and sea salt</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd81:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mary Kosuth, Sherri A.

The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99% were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg. Based on consumer guidelines, our results indicate the average person ingests over 5,800 particles of synthetic debris from these three sources annually, with the largest contribution coming from tap water (88%).</description><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>c135152e</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</originId><published>1523480400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jing Huang</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Neuroscience</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0149-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain</content></content><title>Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6</link><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_162dd386e29:40991ef:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0149-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain</description><crawled>1524129885737</crawled><fingerprint>7d06a78e</fingerprint><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0149-6</originId><published>1524121200000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell&lt;br&gt; Author(s): R.

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</content></content><title>Effect of ENSO events on larval and juvenile duration and transport of Japanese eel (&amp;lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><unread>False</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b3:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

Extensive research revealed tremendous details about how plants sense pathogen effectors during effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, less is known about downstream signaling events. In this report, we demonstrate that prolonged activation of MPK3 and MPK6, two &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; pathogen-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), is essential to ETI mediated by both coiled coil-nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (CNLs) and toll/interleukin-1 receptor nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (TNLs) types of R proteins. MPK3/MK6 activation rapidly alters the expression of photosynthesis-related genes and inhibits photosynthesis, which promotes the accumulation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), two major reactive oxygen species (ROS), in chloroplasts under light. In the chemical-genetically rescued &lt;i&gt;mpk3 mpk6&lt;/i&gt; double mutants, ETI-induced photosynthetic inhibition and chloroplastic ROS accumulation are compromised, which correlates with delayed hypersensitive response (HR) cell death and compromised resistance. Furthermore, protection of chloroplasts by expressing a plastid-targeted cyanobacterial flavodoxin (pFLD) delays photosynthetic inhibition and compromises ETI. Collectively, this study highlights a critical role of MPK3/MPK6 in manipulating plant photosynthetic activities to promote ROS accumulation in chloroplasts and HR cell death, which contributes to the robustness of ETI. Furthermore, the dual functionality of MPK3/MPK6 cascade in promoting defense and inhibiting photosynthesis potentially allow it to orchestrate the trade-off between plant growth and defense in plant immunity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/feggFvBsPmE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Active photosynthetic inhibition mediated by MPK3/MPK6 is critical to effector-triggered immunity</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163272479f8:1445:a96d255</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jianbin Su, Liuyi Yang, Qiankun Zhu, Hongjiao Wu, Yi He, Yidong Liu, Juan Xu, Dean Jiang, Shuqun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore, the dual functionality of MPK3/MPK6 cascade in promoting defense and inhibiting photosynthesis potentially allow it to orchestrate the trade-off between plant growth and defense in plant immunity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/feggFvBsPmE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1525370092024</crawled><fingerprint>dfacb6e3</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004122</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004122</originId><published>1525381200000</published><recrawled>1525375448507</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004122</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Chao Zhang</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025150?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Note: On the dielectric constant of nanoconfined water</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025150?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d19:9f3b30f2</id><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><fingerprint>a9372ac9</fingerprint><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025150?af=R</originId><published>1524139352000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524603600000</updated><author><name>Chanki Yu</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196621</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chanki Yu, Sejung Yang, Wonoh Kim, Jinwoong Jung, Kee-Yang Chung, Sang Wook Lee, Byungho Oh&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Correction: Acral melanoma detection using a convolutional neural network for dermoscopy images</title><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196621</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fbd:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chanki Yu, Sejung Yang, Wonoh Kim, Jinwoong Jung, Kee-Yang Chung, Sang Wook Lee, Byungho Oh&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><fingerprint>7ba44a0d</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196621</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196621</originId><published>1524603600000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00275/20180508/images/medium/mp-2018-00275e_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00275&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Sweat includes active components and metabolites, which are needed to maintain skin homeostasis. Component changes in sweat derived from atopic dermatitis (AD) have been reported. To investigate the influence of sweat components on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed a multifaceted assessment, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomic analysis, and linked these features to clinical features of AD. Distinctive properties of AD sweat are the quite-variation in protein, anti-microbial peptides and glucose concentrations. pH, sodium, and other salt levels in sweat of AD were comparable to that of healthy subjects. Sweat from AD patients with acute inflammation had a more prominent increase in glucose concentration than sweat from healthy individuals or those with AD with chronic inflammation. Topical glucose application delayed recovery of transepidermal water loss in barrier-disrupted mice. Furthermore, the glucose transporter GLUT2 was highly expressed in the lumen of sweat glands from AD patients. AD patients with chronic inflammation had significantly increased &lt;i&gt;GLUT2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression and near normal sweat glucose levels. Despite the small sample size in our study, we speculate that the increased glucose levels might be affected by AD severity and phenotype. We hope that this report will bring novel insight into the impact of sweat components on the clinical manifestation of AD.</content></content><title>Sweat glucose and GLUT2 expression in atopic dermatitis: Implication for clinical manifestation and treatment</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fb:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emi Ono, Hiroyuki Murota, Yuki Mori, Yoshichika Yoshioka, Yuko Nomura, Takichi Munetsugu, Hiroo Yokozeki, Ichiro Katayama&lt;/p&gt;

Unrecognized endobronchial intubation frequently occurs after emergency intubation. However, no study has evaluated the effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We compared the hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during one-lung ventilation with those during conventional two-lung ventilation in a pig model of CPR, to determine the effect of the former on ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).

Unrecognized endobronchial intubation frequently occurs after emergency intubation. However, no study has evaluated the effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We compared the hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during one-lung ventilation with those during conventional two-lung ventilation in a pig model of CPR, to determine the effect of the former on ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). However, no difference in ETCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was detected between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and oxygen saturation (SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) differed among the three types of ventilation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, respectively). The post hoc analyses revealed a higher PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, lower PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and lower SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung or left-lung ventilation. However, the levels of these blood gases did not differ between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations.

A novel α-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 was cloned from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/i&gt;, overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and characterized. The purified enzyme Aga-BC7050 was 85 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and 168 kDa according to gel filtration, indicating that its native structure is a dimer. With &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl-α-d- galactopyranoside (pNPGal) as the substrate, optimal temperature and pH were 55 °C and 6.0, respectively. At 60 °C for 30 min, it retained &gt; 50% of its activity. It was stable at pH 5.0–10.0, and showed remarkable resistance to proteinase K, subtilisin A, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in &amp;lt; 30 min. These characteristics suggest that Aga-BC7050 could be used in feed and food industries and sugar processing.</content></content><title>A novel α-galactosidase from the thermophilic probiotic &amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&amp;lt;/i&gt; with remarkable protease-resistance and high hydrolytic activity</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475068:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ruili Zhao, Rui Zhao, Yishuai Tu, Xiaoming Zhang, Liping Deng, Xiangdong Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Characterising the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens &lt;i&gt;in natura&lt;/i&gt; is key to ensuring their efficient prevention and control. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate dispersal parameters at scales that are relevant to real epidemics. Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease and from the huge number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (&lt;i&gt;Plum pox virus&lt;/i&gt;) surveyed for 15 years in 605 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. About 50% of aphid flights terminate beyond 90 m, which implies that most infectious aphids leaving a tree land outside the bounds of a 1-ha orchard. Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare–10% of flights exceed 1 km. By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Estimation of the dispersal distances of an aphid-borne virus in a patchy landscape</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16317a3def5:127149:ed160cc3</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by David R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite concerns about the representativeness of patients from ALS tertiary centers as compared to the ALS general population, the extent of referral bias in clinical studies remains largely unknown.

Demographic and clinic characteristics of ALS patients diagnosed in tertiary referral centers were contrasted with the whole ALS populations enrolled in registries in the same geographical areas.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients referred to ALS centers were younger (with difference ranging from 1.1 years to 2.4 years), less likely to present a bulbar onset, with a higher proportion of familial antecedents and a longer survival (ranging from 11% to 15%) when compared to the entire ALS population in the same geographic area.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A trend for referral bias is present in cohorts drawn from ALS referral centers.

Background &lt;p&gt;While there is strong evidence showing the survival advantage of elite athletes, much less is known about those engaged in mind sports such as chess. This study aimed to examine the overall as well as regional survival of International Chess Grandmasters (GMs) with a reference to the general population, and compare relative survival (RS) of GMs with that of Olympic medallists (OMs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Information on 1,208 GMs and 15,157 OMs, respectively, from 28 countries were extracted from the publicly available data sources. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rates of the GMs. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust the survival for region, year at risk, age at risk and sex, and to estimate the life expectancy of the GMs. The RS rate was computed by matching each GM or OM by year at risk, age at risk and sex to the life table of the country the individual represented.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The survival rates of GMs at 30 and 60 years since GM title achievement were 87% and 15%, respectively. The life expectancy of GMs at the age of 30 years (which is near the average age when they attained a GM title) was 53.6 ([95% CI]: 47.7–58.5) years, which is significantly greater than the overall weighted mean life expectancy of 45.9 years for the general population. Compared to Eastern Europe, GMs in North America (HR [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.29–0.88]) and Western Europe (HR [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.34–0.83]) had a longer lifespan. The RS analysis showed that both GMs and OMs had a significant survival advantage over the general population, and there was no statistically significant difference in the RS of GMs (RS [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.08–1.20]) compared to OMs: (RS [95% CI]: 1.09 [1.07–1.11]) at 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Elite chess players live longer than the general population and have a similar survival advantage to elite competitors in physical sports.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Longevity of outstanding sporting achievers: Mind versus muscle</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af1:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by An Tran-Duy, David C.

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</content></content><title>Generation of hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells from human induced endodermal progenitor cells</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f71:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarajan Sambathkumar, Renate Akkerman, Sumitava Dastidar, Philip Roelandt, Manoj Kumar, Manmohan Bajaj, Ana Rita Mestre Rosa, Nicky Helsen, Veerle Vanslembrouck, Eric Kalo, Satish Khurana, Jos Laureys, Conny Gysemans, Marijke M.

Adverse event (AE)-related costs represent an important component of economic models for cancer care. However, since previous studies mostly focused on specific AEs, treatments, or cancer types, limited information is currently available. Therefore, this study assessed the incremental healthcare costs associated with a large number of AEs among patients diagnosed with some of the most prevalent types of cancer. Data were obtained from a large US claims database. Adult patients were included if diagnosed with and treated for one of the following cancer types: breast, digestive organs and peritoneum, genitourinary organs (including bladder and ovary and other uterine adnexa), lung, lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, and skin. Treatment episodes were defined as the period from initiation of the first antineoplastic pharmacologic therapy to discontinuation (i.e., gap of ≥ 45 days), or change in treatment regimen, or end of data availability. A total of 36 AEs were selected from the product inserts of 104 treatments recommended by practice guidelines. A retrospective matched cohort design was used, matching a treatment episode with a certain AE with a treatment episode without that AE. A total of 412,005 patients were selected, for a total of 794,243 treatment episodes, resulting in 1,617,368 matched treatment episodes across all 36 AEs. Incremental healthcare costs associated with AEs of any severity ranged from $546 for cough/upper respiratory infections to $24,633 for gastrointestinal perforation. The three most costly AEs when considering any severity were gastrointestinal perforation ($24,633), central nervous system hemorrhage ($24,322), and sepsis/septicemia ($23,510). Incremental healthcare costs associated with severe AEs ranged from $15,709 for dermatitis and rash to $48,538 for gastrointestinal fistula. The three most costly severe AEs were gastrointestinal fistula ($48,538), gastrointestinal perforation ($41,281), and central nervous system hemorrhage ($38,428).

Adverse event (AE)-related costs represent an important component of economic models for cancer care. However, since previous studies mostly focused on specific AEs, treatments, or cancer types, limited information is currently available. Therefore, this study assessed the incremental healthcare costs associated with a large number of AEs among patients diagnosed with some of the most prevalent types of cancer. Data were obtained from a large US claims database. Adult patients were included if diagnosed with and treated for one of the following cancer types: breast, digestive organs and peritoneum, genitourinary organs (including bladder and ovary and other uterine adnexa), lung, lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, and skin. Treatment episodes were defined as the period from initiation of the first antineoplastic pharmacologic therapy to discontinuation (i.e., gap of ≥ 45 days), or change in treatment regimen, or end of data availability. A total of 36 AEs were selected from the product inserts of 104 treatments recommended by practice guidelines. A retrospective matched cohort design was used, matching a treatment episode with a certain AE with a treatment episode without that AE. A total of 412,005 patients were selected, for a total of 794,243 treatment episodes, resulting in 1,617,368 matched treatment episodes across all 36 AEs. Incremental healthcare costs associated with AEs of any severity ranged from $546 for cough/upper respiratory infections to $24,633 for gastrointestinal perforation. The three most costly AEs when considering any severity were gastrointestinal perforation ($24,633), central nervous system hemorrhage ($24,322), and sepsis/septicemia ($23,510). Incremental healthcare costs associated with severe AEs ranged from $15,709 for dermatitis and rash to $48,538 for gastrointestinal fistula. The three most costly severe AEs were gastrointestinal fistula ($48,538), gastrointestinal perforation ($41,281), and central nervous system hemorrhage ($38,428). In conclusion, AEs during treatment episodes for cancer were frequent and associated with a substantial economic burden.</description><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>1d64ea7d</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</originId><published>1523653200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Joshua W.

Access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains deficient without an adequate workforce. There is limited understanding of the gender gap in surgical trainees in LMICs. In Rwanda, females fill only one of 20 positions available. Understanding surgeons’ experiences and perceptions of surgical careers may help facilitate support for females to contribute to the global surgical workforce. We performed qualitative analysis on perceptions of surgical careers through semi-structured interviews of all female surgeons (n = 6) and corresponding male surgeons (n = 6) who are training or have trained at University of Rwanda. Transcripts were analyzed with code structure formed through an integrated approach. Question categories formed the deductive framework, while theoretical saturation was reached through inductive grounded theory. Themes were organized within two key points of the career timeline. First, for developing interest in surgery, three main themes were identified: role models, patient case encounters, and exposure to surgery. Second, for selecting and sustaining surgical careers, four main themes emerged: social expectations about roles within the family, physical and mental challenges, professional and personal support, and finances. All female surgeons emphasized gender assumptions and surgical working culture as obstacles, with a corresponding strong sense of self-confidence and internal motivation that drew them to select and maintain careers in surgery. Family, time, and physical endurance were cited as persistent challenges for female participants. Our study reveals concepts for further exploration about gendered perceptions of surgical careers. Efforts to improve support for female surgical careers as a strategy for shaping surgical work culture and professional development in Rwanda should be considered. Such strategies may be beneficial for improving the global surgical workforce.</content></content><title>A qualitative study on perceptions of surgical careers in Rwanda: A gender-based approach</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915d:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sojung Yi, Yihan Lin, Grace Kansayisa, Ainhoa Costas-Chavarri&lt;/p&gt;

Almost one third of the three million people in China suffering severe deafness are children, and 50% of these cases are believed to have genetic components to their etiology. Newborn hearing genetic screening can complement Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening for the diagnosis of congenital hearing loss as well as identifying children at risk for late-onset and progressive hearing impairment. The aim of this joint academic and Ministry of Health project was to prototype a cost effective newborn genetic screen in a community health setting on a city-wide level, and to ascertain the prevalence of variation at loci that have been associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. With the participation of 143 local hospitals in the city of Wuhan, China we screened 142,417 neonates born between May 2014 and Dec. 2015. The variants GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G, and mitochondrial variants m.1555A&gt;G and m.1494C&gt;T were assayed using real time PCR. Newborns found to carry a variant were re-assayed by sequencing in duplicate. Within a subset of 707 newborns we assayed using real-time PCR and ARMS-PCR to compare cost, sensitivity and operating procedure. The most frequent hearing loss associated allele detected in this population was the 235delC variant in GJB2 gene. In total, 4289 (3.01%) newborns were found to carry at least one allele of either GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G or two assayed MT-RNR1 variants. There was complete accordance between the real-time PCR and the ARMS PCR, though the real-time PCR had a much lower failure rate. Real-time PCR had a lower cost and operating time than ARMS PCR. Ongoing collaboration with the participating hospitals will determine the specificity and sensitivity of the association of the variants with hearing loss at birth and arising in early childhood, allowing an estimation of the benefits of newborn hearing genetic screening in a large-scale community setting.</content></content><title>Large scale newborn deafness genetic screening of 142,417 neonates in Wuhan, China</title><unread>False</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c3:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zongjie Hao, Denggang Fu, Yang Ming, Jinlong Yang, Qi Huang, Weilong Lin, Huan Zhang, Bin Zhang, Aifen Zhou, Xijiang Hu, Cong Yao, Yunping Dong, Huijun Z.

GABA is a robust regulator of both developing and mature neural networks. It exerts many of its effects through GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, which are heteropentamers assembled from a large array of subunits encoded by distinct genes. In mammals, there are 19 different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; subunit types, which are divided into the α, β, γ, δ, ε, π, θ and ρ subfamilies. The immense diversity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors is not fully understood. However, it is known that specific isoforms, with their distinct biophysical properties and expression profiles, tune responses to GABA. Although larval zebrafish are well-established as a model system for neural circuit analysis, little is known about GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors diversity and expression in this system. Here, using database analysis, we show that the zebrafish genome contains at least 23 subunits. All but the mammalian θ and ε subunits have at least one zebrafish ortholog, while five mammalian GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits have two zebrafish orthologs. Zebrafish contain one subunit, β4, which does not have a clear mammalian ortholog. Similar to mammalian GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, the zebrafish α subfamily is the largest and most diverse of the subfamilies. In zebrafish there are eight α subunits, and RNA &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization across early zebrafish development revealed that they demonstrate distinct patterns of expression in the brain, spinal cord, and retina. Some subunits were very broadly distributed, whereas others were restricted to small populations of cells. Subunit-specific expression patterns in zebrafish resembled were those found in frogs and rodents, which suggests that the roles of different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor isoforms are largely conserved among vertebrates. This study provides a platform to examine isoform specific roles of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors within zebrafish neural circuits and it highlights the potential of this system to better understand the remarkable heterogeneity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.</content></content><title>Expression of the eight GABA&amp;lt;sub&gt;A&amp;lt;/sub&gt; receptor α subunits in the developing zebrafish central nervous system</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d73b:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bryan Monesson-Olson, Jon J.

A total of 161 proteins were identified, which were divided into 8 function categories, including enzymes, transporter, calcium ion binding protein, salivary sheath protein, cytoskeleton protein, DNA-, RNA-, and protein-binding or regulating proteins, other non-enzyme proteins and unknown proteins. Gene expression pattern of 11 secretory proteins were analyzed by real time quantitative-PCR. We detected the mucin-like protein, which had a unique expression level in salivary gland, most likely to be a candidate effector involved in regulation of plant defense.

One common challenge in studying biological networks is the need to extract meaningful, small subgraphs out of large databases of potential interactions. A useful abstraction for this task turned out to be the Steiner network problems: given a reference &apos;&apos;database&apos;&apos; graph, find a parsimonious subgraph that satisfies a given set of connectivity demands.

We introduce the condition Steiner network problem in which we concomitantly consider a set of distinct biological conditions. Each condition is associated with a set of connectivity demands, as well as a set of edges that are assumed to be present in that condition. The goal of this problem is to find a minimal subgraph that satisfies all the demands through paths that are present in the respective condition.

Specifically, we prove that for C conditions, this new problem is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of C - epsilon, for every C greater than or equal to 2 and epsilon &gt; 0, and that this bound is tight. Moving beyond the worst case, we explore a special set of instances where the reference graph grows monotonically between conditions, and show that this problem admits substantially improved approximation algorithms. We also developed an integer linear programming solver for the general problem and demonstrate its ability to reach optimality with instances from the human protein interaction network. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to most connectivity problems studied in computational biology, accounting for multiplicity of biological conditions adds considerable complexity, which we propose to address with a new solver.

After carotid artery stenting, the procurement of information about blood flow redistribution among brain-feeding arteries and its time trend is essential to understanding a patient’s physiological background and to determine their care regimen. Cerebral blood flow has been measured twice following carotid artery stenting in few previous studies, with some discrepancies in the results. The purpose of this study was to measure cerebral blood flow at multiple time points after carotid artery stenting, and to elucidate the time trend of cerebral blood flow and redistribution among arteries. Blood flow rates in 11 subjects were measured preoperatively, at one day, one week, and about three months, respectively after carotid artery stenting by using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. The target vessels were the bilateral internal carotid arteries, the basilar artery, and the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. Lumen was semi-automatically defined using an algorithm utilizing pulsatility. The results showed that blood flow rates in the stented internal carotid artery and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery increased following carotid artery stenting. Blood flow rates in the contralateral internal carotid artery and the basilar artery gradually declined, and they were lower than the preoperative values at three months after stenting. The sum of blood flow rates of the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery increased after carotid artery stenting, and then decreased over the next three months. There was no significant change in the blood flow rate in the contralateral middle cerebral artery. From these results, it was concluded that redistribution among the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery occurs after carotid artery stenting, and that it takes months thereafter to reach another equilibrium.</content></content><title>Multiple blood flow measurements before and after carotid artery stenting via phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging: An observational study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd84:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hisashi Tanaka, Yoshiyuki Watanabe, Hajime Nakamura, Hiroto Takahashi, Atsuko Arisawa, Takuya Fujiwara, Chisato Matsuo, Noriyuki Tomiyama&lt;/p&gt;

The red flour beetle, &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt;, is an important model insect and agricultural pest. However, many standard genetic tools are lacking or underdeveloped in this system. Here, we present a set of new reagents to augment existing &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; genetic tools. We demonstrate a new GAL4 driver line that employs the promoter of a ribosomal protein gene to drive expression of a UAS responder in the fat body. We also present a novel dual fluorescent reporter that labels cell membranes and nuclei with different fluorophores for the analysis of cellular morphology. This approach also demonstrates the functionality of the viral T2A peptide for bicistronic gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt;. To facilitate classical genetic analysis, we created lines with visible genetic markers by CRISPR-mediated disruption of the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ebony&lt;/i&gt; body color loci with a cassette carrying an attP site, enabling future φC31-mediated integration. Together, the reagents presented here will facilitate more robust genetic analysis in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; and serve as a blueprint for the further development of this powerful model’s genetic toolkit.</content></content><title>Expanding the genetic toolkit of &amp;lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66dc:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Johnathan C.

Data, including information generated from them by processing and analysis, are an asset with measurable value. The assets that biological research funding produces are the data generated, the information derived from these data, and, ultimately, the discoveries and knowledge these lead to. From the time when Henry Oldenburg published the first scientific journal in 1665 (&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society&lt;/i&gt;) to the founding of the United States National Library of Medicine in 1879 to the present, there has been a sustained drive to improve how researchers can record and discover what is known. Researchers’ experimental work builds upon years and (collectively) billions of dollars’ worth of earlier work. Today, researchers are generating data at ever-faster rates because of advances in instrumentation and technology, coupled with decreases in production costs. Unfortunately, the ability of researchers to manage and disseminate their results has not kept pace, so their work cannot achieve its maximal impact. Strides have recently been made, but more awareness is needed of the essential role that biological data resources, including biocuration, play in maintaining and linking this ever-growing flood of data and information. The aim of this paper is to describe the nature of data as an asset, the role biocurators play in increasing its value, and consistent, practical means to measure effectiveness that can guide planning and justify costs in biological research information resources’ development and management.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/x-fSctih6cc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Biocuration: Distilling data into knowledge</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162cf9286df:ce449:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by International Society for Biocuration &lt;/p&gt;

Plant leaves of different ages differ in nutrients and toxic metabolites and thus exhibit various resistance levels against insect herbivores. However, little is known about the influence of leaf ontogeny on plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects. In this study, we found that the green peach aphid, &lt;i&gt;Myzus persicae&lt;/i&gt;, preferred to settle on young cabbage leaves compared with mature or old leaves, although young leaves contained the highest concentration of glucosinolates. Furthermore, aphids feeding on young leaves had higher levels of glucosinolates in their body, but aphids performed better on young leaves in terms of body weight and population growth. Phloem sap of young leaves had higher amino acid:sugar molar ratio than mature leaves, and aphids feeding on young leaves showed two times longer phloem feeding time and five times more honeydew excretion than on other leaves. These results indicate that aphids acquired the highest amount of nutrients and defensive metabolites when feeding on young cabbage leaves that are strong natural plant sinks. Accordingly, we propose that aphids generally prefer to obtain more nutrition rather than avoiding host plant defense, and total amount of nutrition that aphids could obtain is significantly influenced by leaf ontogeny or source-sink status of feeding sites.</content></content><title>Nutrition versus defense: Why &amp;lt;i&gt;Myzus persicae&amp;lt;/i&gt; (green peach aphid) prefers and performs better on young leaves of cabbage</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb9b:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by He-He Cao, Zhan-Feng Zhang, Xiao-Feng Wang, Tong-Xian Liu&lt;/p&gt;

If a density functional theory (DFT) method is able to yield accurate dipole moments, it should first provide an accurate geometry and then predict a reliable charge distribution for that geometry. In this respect, recent literatures have revealed that most DFT approximations work considerably better for single‐reference molecules with respect to multi‐reference ones, as may be expected from this fact that DFT utilizes a single configuration state function as reference function to represent the density. Putting together, it seems that as compared to the single‐reference systems, situation is slightly more involved in the case of dipole moment calculations of multi‐reference molecules. Effort to address this latter issue constitutes the cornerstone of the present investigation.

If a density functional theory (DFT) method is able to yield accurate dipole moments, it should first provide an accurate geometry and then predict a reliable charge distribution for that geometry. In this respect, recent literatures have revealed that most DFT approximations work considerably better for single‐reference molecules with respect to multi‐reference ones, as may be expected from this fact that DFT utilizes a single configuration state function as reference function to represent the density. Putting together, it seems that as compared to the single‐reference systems, situation is slightly more involved in the case of dipole moment calculations of multi‐reference molecules. Effort to address this latter issue constitutes the cornerstone of the present investigation. To this end, we rely on a different approach where the new optimally (nonempirically) tuned range‐separated hybrid density functionals (OT‐RSHs) without invoking any empirical fitting are proposed for predicting the dipole moments of multi‐reference molecules containing both main‐group elements and transition metals.

Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity.

We developed COMICS (Competition of miRNA Interactions in Cell Systems), a stochastic computational iterative framework for identifying general principles in miRNA regulation. We show that altering the composition of miRNAs governs cell identity. We identified gene sets that exhibit a coordinated behavior with respect to an exhaustive overexpression of all miRNAs. Among the stable genes that exhibit high mRNA retention levels, many participate in translation and belong to the translation machinery. The stable genes are shared among all tested cell, in contrast to the sensitive, low retention genes that are cell-type specific. We conclude that the stochastic nature of miRNA action imparts an unexpected robustness to living cells. The use of a systematic probabilistic approach exposes design principles of miRNAs regulation toward cell states, cell identity, and the translational machinery.</content></content><title>The Translation Machinery Is Immune from miRNA Perturbations: A Cell-Based Probabilistic Approach [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>False</unread><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162aff1ddce:1e06417:7c9981b6</id><description>Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA that regulate most human genes through base-pairing with their targets.

We show that altering the composition of miRNAs governs cell identity. We identified gene sets that exhibit a coordinated behavior with respect to an exhaustive overexpression of all miRNAs. Among the stable genes that exhibit high mRNA retention levels, many participate in translation and belong to the translation machinery. The stable genes are shared among all tested cell, in contrast to the sensitive, low retention genes that are cell-type specific. We conclude that the stochastic nature of miRNA action imparts an unexpected robustness to living cells. The use of a systematic probabilistic approach exposes design principles of miRNAs regulation toward cell states, cell identity, and the translational machinery.</description><crawled>1523370286542</crawled><fingerprint>c8066dbd</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/10/298596</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298596v1?rss=1</originId><published>1523343600000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298596v1?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00121/20180502/images/medium/bi-2018-00121j_0013.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00121&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Genomic analysis of cancer tissues is an essential aspect of personalized oncology treatment. Though it has been suggested that formalin fixation of patient tissues may be suboptimal for molecular studies, this tissue processing approach remains the industry standard. Therefore clinical molecular laboratories must be able to work with formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) material. This study examines the effects of pre-analytic variables introduced by routine pathology processing on specimens used for clinical reports produced by next-generation sequencing technology. Tissue resected from three colorectal cancer patients was subjected to 2, 15, 24, and 48 hour fixation times in neutral buffered formalin. DNA was extracted from all tissues twice, once with uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) treatment to counter deamination effects, and once without. Of note, deamination events at methylated cytosine, as found at CpG sites, remains unaffected by UNG. After extraction a two-step PCR targeted sequencing method was performed using the Illumina MiSeq and the data was analyzed via a custom-built bioinformatics pipeline, including filtration of reads with mapping quality &amp;lt;30. A larger baseline group of samples (n = 20) was examined to establish if there was a sample performance difference between the two DNA extraction methods, with/without UNG treatment. There was no statistical difference between sequencing performance of the two extraction methods when comparing read counts (raw, mapped, and filtered) and read quality (% mapped, % filtered). Analyzing mutation type, there was no significant difference between mutation calls until the 48 hour fixation treatment. At 48 hours there is a significant increase in C/G-&gt;T/A mutations that is not represented in DNA treated with UNG. This suggests these errors may be due to deamination events triggered by a longer fixation time. However the allelic frequency of these events remained below the limit of detection for reportable mutations in this assay (&amp;lt;2%). We do however recommend that suspected intratumoral heterogeneity events be verified by re-sequencing the same FFPE block.</content></content><title>Formalin fixation increases deamination mutation signature but should not lead to false positive mutations in clinical practice</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae71:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leah M.

Individuals with low levels of education systematically have worse health than those with medium or high levels of education. Yet there are few examples of attempts to summarize the evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions targeting health-related behavior among individuals with low education levels, and a large part of the literature is descriptive rather than analytical. A rapid review was carried out to examine the impact of such interventions. Special attention was given to the relative impact of the interventions among individuals with low education levels and their potential to reduce health inequality. Of 1,365 articles initially identified, only 31 were deemed relevant for the review, and of those, nine met the inclusion and quality criteria. The comparability of included studies was limited due to differences in study design, sample characteristics, and definitions of exposure and outcome variables. Therefore, instead of performing a formal meta-analysis, an overall assessment of the available evidence was made and summarized into some general conclusions. We found no support for the notion that the methods used to reduce smoking decrease inequalities in health between educational groups. Evidence was also limited for decreasing inequality through interventions regarding dietary intake, physical activity and mental health. Only one study was found using an intervention designed to decrease socioeconomic inequalities by increasing the use of breast cancer screening. Thus, we concluded that there is a lack of support regarding this type of intervention as well. Therefore, the main conclusion is that solid evidence is lacking for interventions aimed at individual determinants of health and that more research is needed to fill this gap in knowledge.</content></content><title>Reducing health inequalities with interventions targeting behavioral factors among individuals with low levels of education - A rapid review</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae0:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Vilhelmsson, Per-Olof Östergren&lt;/p&gt;

We present a fast, robust and parsimonious approach to detecting signals in an ordered sequence of numbers. Our motivation is in seeking a suitable method to take a sequence of scores corresponding to properties of positions in virus genomes, and find outlying regions of low scores. Suitable statistical methods without using complex models or making many assumptions are surprisingly lacking. We resolve this by developing a method that detects regions of low score within sequences of real numbers. The method makes no assumptions &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; about the length of such a region; it gives the explicit location of the region and scores it statistically. It does not use detailed mechanistic models so the method is fast and will be useful in a wide range of applications. We present our approach in detail, and test it on simulated sequences. We show that it is robust to a wide range of signal morphologies, and that it is able to capture multiple signals in the same sequence. Finally we apply it to viral genomic data to identify regions of evolutionary conservation within influenza and rotavirus.</content></content><title>A new method for detecting signal regions in ordered sequences of real numbers, and application to viral genomic data</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179362c:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julia R.

This paper studies the Retailer Stackelberg game in a supply chain consisting of two manufacturers and one retailer where they compete simultaneously under three factors including price, service and simple price discount contract. It is assumed that the second manufacturer provides service directly to his customers, and the retailer provides service for the first product’s customers, while the retailer buys the first product under price discount from the first manufacturer. The analysis of the optimal equilibrium solutions and the results of the numerical examples show that if a manufacturer chooses the appropriate range of discount rate, he will gain more profit than when there is no discount given to the retailer. This situation can be considered as an effective tool for the coordination of the first manufacturer and the retailer to offer discount by manufacturer and to provide the service by the retailer. We obtain equilibrium solution of Retailer Stackelberg game and analyze the numerical examples under two cases: a) the manufacturers sell their products to the retailer without price discount contract. b) The first manufacturer sells his products to the retailer with the simple price discount contract. The preliminary results show that the service and the price discount contract can improve the performance of supply chain.</content></content><title>Retailer Stackelberg game in a supply chain with pricing and service decisions and simple price discount contract</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7136:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seyed Jafar Sadjadi, Hashem Asadi, Ramin Sadeghian, Hadi Sahebi&lt;/p&gt;

In combat sports such as taekwondo (TKD), athletes rapidly reduce body weight to achieve a desired weight category. Competition takes place 16–24 h after weigh-in and thus, the recovery time is an important factor for competition performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of rapid weight reduction (RWR) on athletic performance and associated hemorheological properties considering relevant recovery time. Five male TKD athletes reduced body weight by 5% within 3½ days. A simulated competition day (SCD) was carried out after a 16 h recovery period. Parameters were measured before RWR, at weigh-in and before and after three TKD simulation matches (SMs) at SCD. Same set-up was conducted but without RWR as control. Basal blood parameters, red blood cells (RBC) deformability and aggregation, serum glucose and fibrinogen were determined. During SMs, heart rate (HR&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;, HR&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;), oxygen uptake (VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;, VO&lt;sub&gt;2mean&lt;/sub&gt;), peak lactate (Peak La&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), difference of lactate (ΔLa) and energy systems (anaerobic-alactic, -lactic and aerobic) were analyzed. Basal blood parameters remained unaltered during the interventions. RBC deformability was reduced and aggregation was increased after RWR but values returned to baseline after recovery and were not affected by the SMs. Glucose level was not affected by the interventions. Kick frequency in SMs was higher after RWR which might be responsible for higher HR&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;, VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;, VO&lt;sub&gt;2mean&lt;/sub&gt;, Peak La&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, ΔLa&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and aerobic demand. The 16 h recovery is sufficient to regenerate measured physiological and hemorheological parameters. TKD-specific performance was not negatively affected during SMs after RWR.</content></content><title>Rapid weight reduction does not impair athletic performance of Taekwondo athletes – A pilot study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7c:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Woo-Hwi Yang, Oliver Heine, Marijke Grau&lt;/p&gt;

TKD-specific performance was not negatively affected during SMs after RWR.</description><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><fingerprint>e48b1ead</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196568</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196568</originId><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196568</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ao Li</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/4dpbJCqFQxk/s41598-018-23428-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23428-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/4dpbJCqFQxk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b924a6a3:c62b99:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23428-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Cascaded Kerr photon-blockade sources and applications in quantum key distribution&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/4dpbJCqFQxk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523524609699</crawled><fingerprint>adcf3510</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23428-w</originId><published>1523516400000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3858.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>MEDICAL SCIENCES Correction for “Regulator of G protein signaling 5 protects against cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis during biomechanical stress of pressure overload,” by Hongliang Li, Chengwei He, Jinhua Feng, Yan Zhang, Qizhu Tang, Zhouyan Bian, Xue Bai, Heng Zhou, Hong Jiang, Scott P.

Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bézier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>A modelling approach for exploring muscle dynamics during cyclic contractions</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d5:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephanie A.

Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, requires two phosphorylation steps to form a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. Adenylate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;) has been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate, while creatine kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;), pyruvate kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;) and pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cell (&lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt;) each have been found to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to the pharmacologically active tenofovir-diphosphate. In the present study, genomic DNA isolated from dried blood spots collected from 505 participants from Bangkok, Thailand; Cape Town, South Africa; and New York City, USA were examined for variants in &lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt; using next-generation sequencing. The bioinformatics tools SIFT and PolyPhen predicted that 19 of the 505 individuals (3.7% frequency) carried variants in at least one kinase that would result in a decrease or loss of enzymatic activity. To functionally test these predictions, AK2 and AK2 variants were expressed in and purified from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, followed by investigation of their activities towards tenofovir. Interestingly, we found that purified AK2 had the ability to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to tenofovir-diphosphate in addition to phosphorylating tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate. Further, four of the six AK2 variants predicted to result in a loss or decrease of enzyme function exhibited a ≥30% decrease in activity towards tenofovir in our in vitro assays. Of note, an AK2 K28R variant resulted in a 72% and 81% decrease in the formation of tenofovir-monophosphate and tenofovir-diphosphate, respectively. These data suggest that there are naturally occurring genetic variants that could potentially impact TFV activation.</content></content><title>Discovery of genetic variants of the kinases that activate tenofovir among individuals in the United States, Thailand, and South Africa: HPTN067</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d3:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dominique B.

These data suggest that there are naturally occurring genetic variants that could potentially impact TFV activation.</description><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><fingerprint>9a832a89</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</originId><published>1523480400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Stress granule transcription</title><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7ce:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>96ddfc2</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.2.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</originId><published>1525974002000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523912400000</updated><author><name>Issaka Abdulai</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195777</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Issaka Abdulai, Laurence Jassogne, Sophie Graefe, Richard Asare, Piet Van Asten, Peter Läderach, Philippe Vaast&lt;/p&gt;
Reduced climatic suitability due to climate change in cocoa growing regions of Ghana is expected in the coming decades. This threatens farmers’ livelihood and the cocoa sector. Climate change adaptation requires an improved understanding of existing cocoa production systems and farmers’ coping strategies. This study characterized current cocoa production, income diversification and shade tree management along a climate gradient within the cocoa belt of Ghana. The objectives were to 1) compare existing production and income diversification between dry, mid and wet climatic regions, and 2) identify shade trees in cocoa agroforestry systems and their distribution along the climatic gradient. Our results showed that current mean cocoa yield level of 288kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the dry region was significantly lower than in the mid and wet regions with mean yields of 712 and 849 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. In the dry region, farmers diversified their income sources with non-cocoa crops and off-farm activities while farmers at the mid and wet regions mainly depended on cocoa (over 80% of annual income). Two shade systems classified as medium and low shade cocoa agroforestry systems were identified across the studied regions. The medium shade system was more abundant in the dry region and associated to adaptation to marginal climatic conditions. The low shade system showed significantly higher yield in the wet region but no difference was observed between the mid and dry regions. This study highlights the need for optimum shade level recommendation to be climatic region specific.</content></content><title>Characterization of cocoa production, income diversification and shade tree management along a climate gradient in Ghana</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae1:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Issaka Abdulai, Laurence Jassogne, Sophie Graefe, Richard Asare, Piet Van Asten, Peter Läderach, Philippe Vaast&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract &lt;p&gt;HIV-positive individuals that have a detected transmitted drug resistance (TDR) at baseline have a higher risk of virological failure with antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study offers an update on the prevalence of TDR in Slovenia, looks for onward transmission of TDR, and reassesses the need for baseline drug resistance testing. Blinded questionnaires and partial &lt;i&gt;pol&lt;/i&gt; sequences were obtained from 54.5% (168/308) of all of the patients diagnosed with HIV-1 from 2011 to 2016. Subtype B was detected in 82.7% (139/168) of patients, followed by subtype A (8.3%), subtype C (2.4%), and CRF01_AE (1.8%). Surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) were found in four individuals (2.4%), all of them men who have sex with men (MSM) and infected with subtype B. K103N was detected in two patients and T68D and T215D in one person each, corresponding to a prevalence of 0%, 1.2%, and 1.2% of TDR to protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-NRTIs (NNRTIs), respectively. The impact of mutations on drug susceptibility was found to be most pronounced for NNRTIs. No forward spread of TDR within the country was observed; however, phylogenetic analysis revealed several new introductions of HIV into Slovenia in recent years, possibly due to increased risky behavior by MSM. This was indirectly confirmed by a substantial increase in syphilis cases and HIV-1 non-B subtypes during the study period. A drug-resistant HIV variant with good transmission fitness is thus more likely to be imported into Slovenia in the near future, and so TDR should be closely monitored.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance in Slovenia and its impact on predicted treatment effectiveness: 2011–2016 update</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefc3:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maja M.

The neurons that form the mammalian neocortex originate from progenitor cells in the ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ). Newborn neurons are multipolar but become bipolar during their migration from the germinal layers to the cortical plate (CP) by forming a leading process and an axon that extends in the intermediate zone (IZ). Once they settle in the CP, neurons assume a highly polarized morphology with a single axon and multiple dendrites. The AMPK-related kinases SadA and SadB are intrinsic factors that are essential for axon formation during neuronal development downstream of Lkb1. The knockout of both genes encoding Sad kinases (&lt;i&gt;Sada&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sadb&lt;/i&gt;) results not only in a loss of axons but also a decrease in the size of the cortical plate. The defect in axon formation has been linked to a function of Sad kinases in the regulation of microtubule binding proteins. However, the causes for the reduced size of the cortical plate in the &lt;i&gt;Sada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;Sadb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; knockout remain to be analyzed in detail. Here we show that neuronal cell death is increased and the number of neural progenitors is decreased in the &lt;i&gt;Sada&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;Sadb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; CP. The reduced number of progenitors is a non-cell autonomous defect since they do not express Sad kinases. These defects are restricted to the neocortex while the hippocampus remains unaffected.</content></content><title>The loss of the kinases SadA and SadB results in early neuronal apoptosis and a reduced number of progenitors</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae82:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pratibha Dhumale, Sindhu Menon, Joanna Chiang, Andreas W.

The long-range sequencing information captured by linked reads, such as those available from 10x Genomics (10xG), helps resolve genome sequence repeats, and yields accurate and contiguous draft genome assemblies. We introduce ARKS, an alignment-free linked read genome scaffolding methodology that uses linked reads to organize genome assemblies further into contiguous drafts. Our approach departs from other read alignment-dependent linked read scaffolders, including our own (ARCS), and uses a kmer-based mapping approach. The kmer mapping strategy has several advantages over read alignment methods, including better usability and faster processing, as it precludes the need for input sequence formatting and draft sequence assembly indexing. The reliance on kmers instead of read alignments for pairing sequences relaxes the workflow requirements, and drastically reduces the run time. Results. Here, we show how linked reads, when used in conjunction with Hi-C data for scaffolding, improve a draft human genome assembly of PacBio long-read data five-fold (baseline vs. ARKS NG50=4.6 vs. 23.1 Mbp, respectively). We also demonstrate how the method provides further improvements of a megabase-scale Supernova human genome assembly, which itself exclusively uses linked read data for assembly, with an execution speed six to nine times faster than competitive linked read scaffolders. Following ARKS scaffolding of a human genome 10xG Supernova assembly (of cell line NA12878), fewer than 9 scaffolds cover each chromosome, except the largest (chromosome 1, n=13). Conclusions. ARKS uses a kmer mapping strategy instead of linked read alignments to record and associate the barcode information needed to order and orient draft assembly sequences. The simplified workflow, when compared to that of our initial implementation, ARCS, markedly improves run time performances on experimental human genome datasets. Furthermore, ARKS utilizes barcoding information from linked reads to estimate gap size. It accomplishes this by modeling the relationship between known distances of a region within contigs and calculating associated Jaccard indices. ARKS has the potential to provide correct, chromosome-scale, genome assemblies, promptly. We expect ARKS to have broad utility in helping refine draft genomes.</content></content><title>ARKS: chromosome-scale scaffolding of human genomedrafts with linked read kmers [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162fe0aa535:60754f:7d6c1c1c</id><description>Background.

The macaque is widely accepted as a suitable model for preclinical characterization of dengue vaccine candidates. However, the only vaccine for which both preclinical and clinical efficacy results were reported so far showed efficacy levels that were substantially different between macaques and humans. We hypothesized that this model’s predictive capacity may be improved using recent and minimally passaged dengue virus isolates, and by assessing vaccine efficacy by characterizing not only the post-dengue virus challenge viremia/RNAemia but also the associated-cytokine profile. Ten recent and minimally passaged Brazilian clinical isolates from the four dengue virus serotypes were tested for their infectivity in rhesus macaques. For the strains showing robust replication capacity, the associated-changes in soluble mediator levels, and the elicited dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses, were also characterized. Three isolates from dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 4 induced viremia of high magnitude and longer duration relative to previously reported viremia kinetics in this model, and robust dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses. Consistent with observations in humans, increased MCP-1, IFN-γ and VEGF-A levels, and transiently decreased IL-8 levels were detected after infection with the selected isolates. These results may contribute to establishing a dengue macaque model showing a higher predictability for vaccine efficacy in humans.</content></content><title>Characterization of recent and minimally passaged Brazilian dengue viruses inducing robust infection in rhesus macaques</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67bb:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Beatriz Borges, Renato Sergio Marchevsky, Ygara S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Elevated testosterone (T) is routinely reported as a marker of hyperandrogenemia in rodent models for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In women with PCOS, elevated serum androstenedione (A4) is associated with more severe phenotypes, including a positive correlation with serum T, DHEAS, free androgen index (FAI), LH, and LH/FSH ratio. Furthermore, A4, along with calculated free T and FAI, was identified as one of the best predictors of PCOS in adult women of all ages (18 to &gt; 50 y).&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate serum A4 levels in early adolescent and young adult prenatally androgenized (PNA) female rats, a model for PCOS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pregnant rats were injected with 5 mg T daily during gestational days 16–19 (PNA rats, experimental group) or an equal volume of vehicle (control group). Female offspring of both groups had tail vein blood drawn for serum analysis at 8 and 16 weeks of age. ELISAs were used to quantify serum A4 and T levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Serum A4 and T were elevated in 16-week-old PNA rats compared to controls. There was no significant difference in either hormone at 8 weeks of age.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The PNA rats demonstrated elevated serum A4 and T in young adulthood, as has been observed in women with PCOS, further validating this as a model for PCOS and underscoring the importance of serum A4 elevation as a parameter inherent to PCOS and a rodent model for the disorder.

Significant A4 elevation develops between early adolescence and early adulthood in this PNA rat model.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><fingerprint>27836575</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196862</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196862</originId><published>1525381200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196862</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Meng Xu</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022761?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Convergence of high order memory kernels in the Nakajima-Zwanzig generalized master equation and rate constants: Case study of the spin-boson model</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022761?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1630b2b1723:100d5dd:fc1f8953</id><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1524900763427</crawled><fingerprint>c78b9480</fingerprint><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022761?af=R</originId><published>1524548222000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Proctor, R.

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</content></content><title>First record of &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; formation of ectomycorrhizae in &amp;lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&amp;lt;/i&gt; Sabine, a native Myrtaceae of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505f:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) to prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain. Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities. It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood. Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95). We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users. LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011 and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.019 respectively). 20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.040) but not women. Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE. These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.</content></content><title>Celecoxib use and circulating oxylipins in a colon polyp prevention trial</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae6d:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica A.

To navigate their surroundings, cells rely on sensory input that is corrupted by noise. In cells performing chemotaxis, such noise arises from the stochastic binding of signalling molecules at low chemoattractant concentrations. We reveal a fundamental relationship between the speed of chemotactic steering and the strength of directional fluctuations that result from the amplification of noise in a chemical input signal. This relation implies a trade-off between steering that is slow and reliable, and steering that is fast but less reliable. We show that dynamic switching between these two modes of steering can substantially increase the probability to find a target, such as an egg to be found by sperm cells. This decision making confers no advantage in the absence of noise, but is beneficial when chemical signals are detectable, yet characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios. The latter applies at intermediate distances from a target, where signalling molecules are diluted, thus defining a ‘noise zone’ that cells have to cross. Our results explain decision making observed in recent experiments on sea urchin sperm chemotaxis. More generally, our theory demonstrates how decision making enables chemotactic agents to cope with high levels of noise in gradient sensing by dynamically adjusting the persistence length of a biased random walk.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0k29V7Enzbw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Decision making improves sperm chemotaxis in the presence of noise</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162df187f34:50ab5:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Justus A.

Increases of the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain generally lead to increases of production of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products. MnSOD is the first line of defense against the stress induced by mitochondrial ROS. Our previous studies demonstrated that EAE progression increased Na,K-ATPase activity in the mouse kidney cortex. Since mitochondria are the major source of ATP, our present studies were sought to determine whether EAE progression increased mitochondrial activity. We found that severe EAE increased mitochondrial complex II and IV activities without significantly affecting complex I activity with corresponding increases of ROS in the isolated mitochondria and native kidney cortex. Severe EAE augmented both cytosolic and mitochondrial MnSOD protein levels and activities and decreased the specific activity of mitochondrial MnSOD when the total mitochondrial MnSOD activity was normalized to the protein level. Using HEK293 cells as a model free of interference from immune reactions, we found that activation of Na,K-ATPase by monensin for 24 hours increased complex II activity, mitochondrial ROS and MnSOD protein abundance, and decreased the specific activity of the mitochondrial MnSOD. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase by ouabain or catalase attenuated the effects of monensin on the mitochondrial complex II activity, ROS, MnSOD protein level and specific activity. Kockdown of MnSOD by RNAi reduced the mitochondrial ability to generate ATP. In conclusion, EAE increases mitochondrial activity possibly to meet the energy demand from increased Na,K-ATPase activity. EAE increases mitochondrial MnSOD protein abundance to compensate for the loss of the specific activity of the enzyme, thus minimizing the harmful effects of ROS.</content></content><title>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) up-regulates the mitochondrial activity and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the mouse renal cortex</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa5:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Balamurugan Packialakshmi, Xiaoming Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) catalyze the biosynthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and play an important role in many signal transduction pathways.

Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) catalyze the biosynthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and play an important role in many signal transduction pathways. The enzymatic activity of ACs is carefully controlled by a variety of molecules, including G-protein subunits that can both stimulate and inhibit cAMP production. Using homology models developed from existing structural data, we have carried out all-atom, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on the AC5 isoform of adenylyl cyclase and on its complexes with ATP and with the stimulatory G-protein subunit Gsα. The results show that both ATP and Gsα binding have significant effects on the structure and flexibility of adenylyl cyclase. New data on ATP bound to AC5 in the absence of Gsα notably help to explain how Gsα binding enhances enzyme activity and could aid product release. Simulations also suggest a possible coupling between ATP binding and interactions with the inhibitory G-protein subunit Gαi.</description><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><fingerprint>a18f24f3</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196207</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196207</originId><published>1524690000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196207</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Vinson, V., Funk, M.

In summary, tICA is a powerful novel algorithm for decomposing multi-omic data, which will be of great value to the research community.</description><crawled>1523649870034</crawled><fingerprint>bb2e5322</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/13/300277</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300277v1?rss=1</originId><published>1523602800000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300277v1?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 16, Page 925-929, June 15, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24984?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/16&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, Page 925-929, June 15, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Issue Information</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24984?af=R</link><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1632184d727:54a61f:3dd877af</id><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 16, Page 925-929, June 15, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1525275744039</crawled><fingerprint>7655841c</fingerprint><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24984?af=R</originId><published>1525177896000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Claudio Elgueta</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/wM_8SP3zRmw/s41598-018-24193-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Electrical coupling between A17 cells enhances reciprocal inhibitory feedback to rod bipolar cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Electrical coupling between A17 cells enhances reciprocal inhibitory feedback to rod bipolar cells, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24193-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24193-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Electrical coupling between A17 cells enhances reciprocal inhibitory feedback to rod bipolar cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/wM_8SP3zRmw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Publisher Correction: Electrical coupling between A17 cells enhances reciprocal inhibitory feedback to rod bipolar cells</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24193-6</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d27a7ca8:2fa44d5:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Electrical coupling between A17 cells enhances reciprocal inhibitory feedback to rod bipolar cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Electrical coupling between A17 cells enhances reciprocal inhibitory feedback to rod bipolar cells, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24193-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24193-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Electrical coupling between A17 cells enhances reciprocal inhibitory feedback to rod bipolar cells&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/wM_8SP3zRmw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523949665448</crawled><fingerprint>e5163366</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24193-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24193-6</originId><published>1523948400000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Twila A.

Fisheries management is most effective when based on scientific estimates of sustainable fishing rates. While some simple approaches allow estimation of harvest limits, more data-intensive stock assessments are generally required to evaluate the stock’s biomass and fishing rates relative to sustainable levels. Here we evaluate how stock characteristics relate to the rate of new assessments in the United States. Using a statistical model based on time-to-event analysis and 569 coastal marine fish and invertebrate stocks landed in commercial fisheries, we quantify the impact of region, habitat, life-history, and economic factors on the annual probability of being assessed. Although the majority of landings come from assessed stocks in all regions, less than half of the regionally-landed species currently have been assessed. As expected, our time-to-event model identified landed tonnage and ex-vessel price as the dominant factors determining increased rates of new assessments. However, we also found that after controlling for landings and price, there has been a consistent bias towards assessing larger-bodied species. A number of vulnerable groups such as rockfishes (Scorpaeniformes) and groundsharks (Carcharhiniformes) have a relatively high annual probability of being assessed after controlling for their relatively small tonnage and low price. Due to relatively low landed tonnage and price of species that are currently unassessed, our model suggests that the number of assessed stocks will increase more slowly in future decades.</content></content><title>Drivers and rates of stock assessments in the United States</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f66:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Neubauer, James T.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a thrombotic microangiopathy arising from consumption of both coagulation factors and platelets. DIC is triggered by a number of clinical conditions including severe infection, trauma and obstetric complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition is paramount. A high clinical index of suspicion is needed to ensure that patients at risk of developing DIC are appropriately investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In order to establish the clinical conditions most frequently associated with DIC, we reviewed all DIC screens received at a tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa over a 1 year period.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The commonest clinical condition associated with DIC in our population was infection with 84% of patients infected with an identified pathogen. The most frequently diagnosed pathogen was HIV followed by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; and other bacterial infections. In the majority of cases, bacteria were isolated from blood cultures. In 47 patients, HIV was the only pathogen which could be isolated. A relative risk ratio of 2.73 and an odds ratio of 29.97 was attributed to HIV for development of a DIC. A malignancy was present in 51 of the patients of which approximately 60% had co-existing infection. No cause could be attributed in 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Infection was identified in the majority of the patients diagnosed with DIC in this study. HIV showed the highest relative risk ratio of all pathogens although previous studies have not suggested that HIV was strongly associated with DIC. In almost half of the HIV infected patients, there was no other pathogen isolated despite extensive investigation. This suggests that HIV has a strong association with the development of DIC, warranting further research into the relationship between HIV and disseminated microvascular thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Pathogenic factors associated with development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) in a tertiary academic hospital in South Africa</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66cb:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth S.

The thalamus, a crucial regulator of cortical functions, is composed of many nuclei arranged in a spatially complex pattern. Thalamic neurogenesis occurs over a short period during mammalian embryonic development. These features have hampered the effort to understand how regionalization, cell divisions, and fate specification are coordinated and produce a wide array of nuclei that exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression and functions. Here, we performed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; clonal analysis to track the divisions of individual progenitor cells and spatial allocation of their progeny in the developing mouse thalamus. Quantitative analysis of clone compositions revealed evidence for sequential generation of distinct sets of thalamic nuclei based on the location of the founder progenitor cells. Furthermore, we identified intermediate progenitor cells that produced neurons populating more than one thalamic nuclei, indicating a prolonged specification of nuclear fate. Our study reveals an organizational principle that governs the spatial and temporal progression of cell divisions and fate specification and provides a framework for studying cellular heterogeneity and connectivity in the mammalian thalamus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bh5Rbs1VtLg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>In vivo clonal analysis reveals spatiotemporal regulation of thalamic nucleogenesis</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f3ad5b12:38e8b4:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Z.

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</content></content><title>Local dynamic stability during gait for predicting falls in elderly people: A one-year prospective study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914d:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major mediator of peritoneal fibrosis and reportedly affects expression of the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9. SET7/9-induced H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) critically activates transcription of fibrosis-related genes. In this study, we examined the effect of SET7/9 inhibition on peritoneal fibrosis in mice and in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). We also examined SET7/9 expression in nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Murine peritoneal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) into male C57/BL6 mice over 21 days. Sinefungin, a SET7/9 inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously just before MGO injection (10 mg/kg). SET7/9 expression was elevated in both MGO-injected mice and nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of PD patients. SET7/9 expression was positively correlated with dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine in PD patients. Sinefungin was shown immunohistochemically to suppress expression of mesenchymal cells and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased H3K4me1 levels. Peritoneal equilibration tests showed that sinefungin attenuated the urea nitrogen transport rate from plasma and the glucose absorption rate from the dialysate. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, sinefungin suppressed TGF-β1-induced expression of fibrotic markers and inhibited H3K4me1. These findings suggest that inhibiting the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis.</content></content><title>Inhibition of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3adf:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Tamura, Shigehiro Doi, Ayumu Nakashima, Kensuke Sasaki, Kazuya Maeda, Toshinori Ueno, Takao Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to investigate the molecular pathways involved in muscle wasting in an animal model of osteoarthritis (OA) induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) in rats. Reduction of protein syntheses, increased proteolysis and impaired muscle regeneration are important pathways related to muscle wasting, and myogenin, MyoD, myostatin and MuRF-1 are some of their markers. Female Wistar rats were allocated into two groups: OA (submitted to the ACLT) and SHAM (submitted to surgery without ACLT). Nociception, spontaneous exploratory locomotion and body weight of animals were evaluated weekly. Twelve weeks after the disease induction, animals were euthanized, and the right knee joints were collected. Gastrocnemius muscle of the right hind paw were dissected and weighed. Gastrocnemius was used for evaluation of muscle atrophy and expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, Pax7, myogenin, MyoD, myostatin and MuRF-1. Histopathology of the knee confirmed the development of the disease in animals of OA group. Gastrocnemius of OA animals showed a reduction of about 10% in area and an increased IL-1β expression compared to animals of SHAM group. Expression of myostatin was increased in OA group, while myogenin expression was decreased. TNF-α, Pax7, MuRF-1 and MyoD expression was similar in both OA and SHAM groups. Nociception was significantly elevated in OA animals in the last two weeks of experimental period. Spontaneous exploratory locomotion, body weight and weight of gastrocnemius showed no difference between OA and SHAM groups. Gastrocnemius atrophy in OA induced by ACLT involves elevated expression of IL-1β within the muscle, as well as increased expression of myostatin and decreased expression of myogenin. Therefore, muscle wasting may be linked to impaired muscle regeneration.</content></content><title>Muscle wasting in osteoarthritis model induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e5d:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jordana Miranda de Souza Silva, Paulo Vinicius Gil Alabarse, Vivian de Oliveira Nunes Teixeira, Eduarda Correa Freitas, Francine Hehn de Oliveira, Rafael Mendonça da Silva Chakr, Ricardo Machado Xavier&lt;/p&gt;

During hemolysis, hemoglobin and heme released from red blood cells promote oxidative stress, inflammation and thrombosis. Plasma haptoglobin and hemopexin scavenge free hemoglobin and heme, respectively, but can be depleted in hemolytic states. Haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation protect tissues, including the vasculature, liver and kidneys. It is widely assumed that these protective effects are due primarily to hemoglobin and heme clearance from the vasculature. However, this simple assumption does not account for the consequent cytoprotective adaptation seen in cells and organs. To further address the mechanism, we used a hyperhemolytic murine model (Townes-SS) of sickle cell disease to examine cellular responses to haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation. A single infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin (± equimolar hemoglobin) in SS-mice increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the liver, kidney and skin several fold within 1 hour and decreased nuclear NF-ĸB phospho-p65, and vaso-occlusion for 48 hours after infusion. Plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were not significantly changed 1 hour after infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin. Haptoglobin and hemopexin also inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation and lipopolysaccharide-induced vaso-occlusion in SS-mice. Inhibition of HO-1 activity with tin protoporphyrin blocked the protections afforded by haptoglobin and hemopexin in SS-mice. The HO-1 reaction product carbon monoxide, fully restored the protection, in part by inhibiting Weibel-Palade body mobilization of P-selectin and von Willebrand factor to endothelial cell surfaces. Thus, the mechanism by which haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation in hyperhemolytic SS-mice induces cytoprotective cellular responses is linked to increased HO-1 activity.</content></content><title>Haptoglobin and hemopexin inhibit vaso-occlusion and inflammation in murine sickle cell disease: Role of heme oxygenase-1 induction</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67c4:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by John D.

Multivariable analysis showed that pre-CRT short-axis diameter of LPLNs ≥8 mm, size reduction rate ≤33.3%, and heterogeneous signal intensity were independently associated with LPLN metastasis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The size and signal intensity of LPLN before and after CRT are useful MRI findings to predict LPLN metastasis and are helpful to determine the indications for LPLD.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>23de69c6</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195815</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195815</originId><published>1523566800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195815</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Plaza Onate, F.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/173203v5?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Analysis toolkits for shotgun metagenomic data achieve strain-level characterization of complex microbial communities by capturing intra-species gene content variation.

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</content></content><title>Optic tract injury after closed head traumatic brain injury in mice: A model of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559161:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) induces a systemic inflammatory state affecting iron homeostasis. Patients with TB often have additional comorbidities such as anemia which can result in poorer treat outcomes. We studied the contribution of anemia and the role of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin among TB patients and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed serum samples from 102 TB cases and 98 controls without TB, matched by age/sex, for hepcidin, iron, and inflammation parameters. Five controls developed TB within 12 months.

Background &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) induces a systemic inflammatory state affecting iron homeostasis. Patients with TB often have additional comorbidities such as anemia which can result in poorer treat outcomes. We studied the contribution of anemia and the role of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin among TB patients and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed serum samples from 102 TB cases and 98 controls without TB, matched by age/sex, for hepcidin, iron, and inflammation parameters. Five controls developed TB within 12 months. We used linear regression to assess associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) was more frequent among cases than controls (59.8% vs. 26.1%), but iron-deficiency anemia more frequent in controls (10% vs. 1%).

A widespread opinion is that conservation efforts disproportionately benefit charismatic species. However, this doesn’t mean that they are not threatened, and which species are “charismatic” remains unclear. Here, we identify the 10 most charismatic animals and show that they are at high risk of imminent extinction in the wild. We also find that the public ignores these animals’ predicament and we suggest it could be due to the observed biased perception of their abundance, based more on their profusion in our culture than on their natural populations. We hypothesize that this biased perception impairs conservation efforts because people are unaware that the animals they cherish face imminent extinction and do not perceive their urgent need for conservation. By freely using the image of rare and threatened species in their product marketing, many companies may participate in creating this biased perception, with unintended detrimental effects on conservation efforts, which should be compensated by channeling part of the associated profits to conservation. According to our hypothesis, this biased perception would be likely to last as long as the massive cultural and commercial presence of charismatic species is not accompanied by adequate information campaigns about the imminent threats they face.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Nro8ydzQjr8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>The paradoxical extinction of the most charismatic animals</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2ae:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franck Courchamp, Ivan Jaric, Céline Albert, Yves Meinard, William J.

But change in this area is a hard thing to bring about. &lt;em&gt;Biocentury&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/biocentury/regulation/2018-04-12/why-john-ioannidis-says-norm-p-values-should-shift-0005&quot;&gt;a good interview&lt;/a&gt; with someone who can tell you about that, John Ioannidis, of scientific reproducibility fame. He’s recently set off a lot of comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2676503?redirect=true&quot;&gt;with a proposal&lt;/a&gt; to lower the threshold for “significance” to p &amp;lt; 0.005, and as you’d imagine, there are some strong opinions on that. His estimate is that this would shift about a third of the published biomedical results to “suggestive” rather than significant, and his take on this is, basically “good riddance”. According to Ioannidis, a lot of those are false positives anyway, and a lot of the ones that are real are not really useful. Here’s the root of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: What is the correct way to think about a p-value?&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: A p-value is the probability or the chance that you’ll see a result that is so extreme as the one that you see if the null hypothesis is true and if there is no bias. Many people say a p-value is the chance of the null hypothesis being wrong, of some effect being there. This completely ignores the fact that you have these two ‘ifs’ that are required to interpret the p-value. So it is the chance of seeing such an extreme result, or something even more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true and if we have no bias.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he’s upfront about the fact that his suggested new threshold is not the final answer, but just an interim step towards larger reforms. He wants to see better experimental and trial designs (Bayesian and traditional), larger sample sizes, and more attention paid to potential sources of bias and to effect size. In fact, if people just go wild for the new, stricter p-values, it’ll be a loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BC: Don’t you have a concern that by moving to a smaller p-value you are reinforcing the fetish about p-values and driving people to create enormous data sets? With data sets that are big enough, you can get very small p-values, but that doesn’t mean the results mean anything.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JI: Absolutely. And this is why 80% of the literature should not be using p-values, maybe 90% of the literature. With huge amounts of data, with big data, using a p-value means nothing, because everything can be statistically significant at 0.05 or even at 0.005. &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the question is, how do you change the mentality of people who are kind of automatically hooked to using a single magic number? It’s not that the alternative approaches that are better, like using effect size and confidence intervals or using Bayesian statistics, are recent. They have been out there for a long time, but their adoption, even though it is accelerating, has not been what we want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, he thinks that p-value is the right tool for the job about 20% of the time, whereas Bayesian measures could be useful half the time, maybe even more. One instant objection to the idea of lowering p-value cutoffs is that it will make everything much more expensive and time-consuming (clinical trials, first and foremost), but his contention is that it doesn’t have to be that way. Better designs and more appropriate measures could cancel a lot of the brute-force bigger-sample stuff – and you get the impression that he’s deliberately pushing people towards those by making it too expensive to do it the old way. “We have some very strong tools that we don’t apply”, says Ioannidis, and he’s going to try to make people apply them, one way or another. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Tighten Up Your Numbers!</title><unread>True</unread><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162ce5485f1:29ae598:9f3b30f2</id><description>There’s clearly something wrong with the way that statistics get handled and interpreted in scientific studies, and there have been many warnings.

Genetic variability in insect vectors is valuable to study vector competence determinants and to select non-vector populations that may help reduce the spread of vector-borne pathogens. We collected and tested vector competency of 15 isofemale lines of Asian citrus psyllid, &lt;i&gt;Diaphorina citri&lt;/i&gt;, vector of ‘&lt;i&gt;Candidatus&lt;/i&gt; Liberibacter asiaticus’ (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las is associated with huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults were collected from orange jasmine (&lt;i&gt;Murraya paniculata&lt;/i&gt;) hedges in Florida, and individual pairs (females and males) were caged on healthy &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants for egg laying. The progeny from each pair that tested &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-negative by qPCR were maintained on &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants and considered an isofemale line.

Genetic variability in insect vectors is valuable to study vector competence determinants and to select non-vector populations that may help reduce the spread of vector-borne pathogens. We collected and tested vector competency of 15 isofemale lines of Asian citrus psyllid, &lt;i&gt;Diaphorina citri&lt;/i&gt;, vector of ‘&lt;i&gt;Candidatus&lt;/i&gt; Liberibacter asiaticus’ (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las is associated with huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults were collected from orange jasmine (&lt;i&gt;Murraya paniculata&lt;/i&gt;) hedges in Florida, and individual pairs (females and males) were caged on healthy &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants for egg laying. The progeny from each pair that tested &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-negative by qPCR were maintained on &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants and considered an isofemale line. Six acquisition tests on &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults that were reared as nymphs on &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-infected citrus, from various generations of each line, were conducted to assess their acquisition rates (percentage of qPCR-positive adults).

The centrosome is a non–membrane-bound cellular compartment consisting of 2 centrioles surrounded by a protein coat termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles generally remain physically associated together (a phenomenon called centrosome cohesion), yet how this occurs in the absence of a bounding lipid membrane is unclear. One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties, or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles), in contrast, do not form roots and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing discrete roots. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent reshuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Stable centrosomal roots disentangle to allow interphase centriole independence</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2af:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Mahen&lt;/p&gt;

We investigated how visual and kinaesthetic/efferent information is integrated for speed perception in running. Twelve moderately trained to trained subjects ran on a treadmill at three different speeds (8, 10, 12 km/h) in front of a moving virtual scene. They were asked to match the visual speed of the scene to their running speed–i.e., treadmill’s speed. For each trial, participants indicated whether the scene was moving slower or faster than they were running. Visual speed was adjusted according to their response using a staircase until the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) was reached, i.e., until visual and running speed were perceived as equivalent. For all three running speeds, participants systematically underestimated the visual speed relative to their actual running speed. Indeed, the speed of the visual scene had to exceed the actual running speed in order to be perceived as equivalent to the treadmill speed. The underestimation of visual speed was speed-dependent, and percentage of underestimation relative to running speed ranged from 15% at 8km/h to 31% at 12km/h. We suggest that this fact should be taken into consideration to improve the design of attractive treadmill-mediated virtual environments enhancing engagement into physical activity for healthier lifestyles and disease prevention and care.</content></content><title>Matching optical flow to motor speed in virtual reality while running on a treadmill</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d5:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Caramenti, Claudio L.

Our findings highlight the need for careful filtering of multiplex sequencing data before downstream analysis, and the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that applies to the barcode demultiplexing methods.</description><crawled>1524685633051</crawled><fingerprint>9e4a350</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/25/308262</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308262v1?rss=1</originId><published>1524639600000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308262v1?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.7b01289/20180418/images/medium/ct-2017-01289h_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01289&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

According to the Climatic Variability Hypothesis [CVH], thermal plasticity should be wider in organisms from temperate environments, but is unlikely to occur in tropical latitudes where temperature fluctuations are narrow. In copepods, food availability has been suggested as the main driver of phenotypic variability in adult size if the range of temperature change is less than 14°C. &lt;i&gt;Leptodiaptomus garciai&lt;/i&gt; is a calanoid copepod inhabiting Lake Alchichica, a monomictic, tropical lake in Mexico that experiences regular, narrow temperature fluctuations but wide changes in phytoplankton availability. We investigated whether the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food produce phenotypic variation in the life-history traits of this tropical species. We sampled &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;garciai&lt;/i&gt; throughout a year and measured female size, egg size and number, and hatching success, along with temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The amplitude of the plastic responses was estimated with the Phenotypic Plasticity Index. This index was also computed for a published dataset of 84 copepod populations to look if there is a relationship between the amplitude of the phenotypic plasticity of adult size and seasonal change in temperature. The temperature annual range in Lake Alchichica was 3.2°C, whereas phytoplankton abundance varied 17-fold. A strong pattern of thermal plasticity in egg size and adult female size followed the inverse relationship with temperature commonly observed in temperate environments, although its adaptive value was not demonstrated. Egg number, relative reproductive effort and number of nauplii per female were clearly plastic to food availability, allowing organisms to increase their fitness. When comparing copepod species from different latitudes, we found that the magnitude of thermal plasticity of adult size is not related to the range of temperature variation; furthermore, thermal plasticity exists even in environments of limited temperature variation, where the response is more intense compared to temperate populations.</content></content><title>Phenotypic plasticity of life-history traits of a calanoid copepod in a tropical lake: Is the magnitude of thermal plasticity related to thermal variability?</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4a:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Ortega-Mayagoitia, Osvaldo Hernández-Martínez, Jorge Ciros-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to determine the origin of soybeans is an important issue following the inclusion of this information in the labeling of agricultural food products becoming mandatory in South Korea in 2017. This study was carried out to construct a prediction model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybeans using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis. The optimal prediction models for discriminating soybean samples were obtained by selecting appropriate scaling methods, normalization methods, variable influence on projection (VIP) cutoff values, and wave-number regions. The factors for constructing the optimal partial-least-squares regression (PLSR) prediction model were using second derivatives, vector normalization, unit variance scaling, and the 4000–400 cm&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; region (excluding water vapor and carbon dioxide). The PLSR model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybean samples had the best predictability when a VIP cutoff value was not applied. When Chinese soybean samples were identified, a PLSR model that has the lowest root-mean-square error of the prediction value was obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5. The optimal PLSR prediction model for discriminating Korean soybean samples was also obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5. This is the first study that has combined FT-IR spectroscopy with normalization methods, VIP cutoff values, and selected wave-number regions for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybeans.</content></content><title>Discrimination and prediction of the origin of Chinese and Korean soybeans using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) with multivariate statistical analysis</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fac:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byeong-Ju Lee, Yaoyao Zhou, Jae Soung Lee, Byeung Kon Shin, Jeong-Ah Seo, Doyup Lee, Young-Suk Kim, Hyung-Kyoon Choi&lt;/p&gt;

Population dynamics in urban and rural areas are different. Understanding factors that contribute to local population changes has various socioeconomic and political implications. In the present study, we use population census data in Japan to examine contributors to the population growth of residential clusters between years 2005 and 2010. The data set covers the entirety of Japan and has a high spatial resolution of 500 × 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling us to examine population dynamics in various parts of the country (urban and rural) using statistical analysis. We found that, in addition to the area, population density, and age, the shape of the cluster and the spatial distribution of inhabitants within the cluster are significantly related to the population growth rate of a residential cluster. Specifically, the population tends to grow if the cluster is &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; shaped (given the area) and the population is concentrated near the center rather than periphery of the cluster. Combination of the present results and analysis framework with other factors that have been omitted in the present study, such as migration, terrain, and transportation infrastructure, will be fruitful.</content></content><title>Population changes in residential clusters in Japan</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee5:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takuya Sekiguchi, Kohei Tamura, Naoki Masuda&lt;/p&gt;

The polymorphisms at the α-chain of the IL-7 receptor (&lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt;) have been related to T-cell homeostasis and development and may contribute to immune system deregulation. In the present study, we analyzed the association between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms and the progression of liver fibrosis in patients infected with HCV. We carried out a retrospective study with a design consisting of repeated measurements in 187 HCV-infected patients, to study the risk prediction of liver fibrosis progression using genetic factors. We genotyped the rs6897932, rs987106 and rs3194051 &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms using the Agena Bioscience’s MassARRAY. Transient elastography was used to measure liver stiffness. The used cut-offs were: &amp;lt;7.1 kPa (F0-F1), 7.1–9.4 kPa (F2; significant fibrosis), 9.5-12.4 kPa (F3; advanced fibrosis), and ≥12.5 kPa (F4; cirrhosis). All HCV genotypes were analyzed. The median of follow-up time was 47.9 months. Baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values did not show significant statistical differences for &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes (p&gt;0.05). In univariate analysis, the rs6897932 T allele had a positive relationship with an increase in LSM (arithmetic mean ratio (AMR) = 1.21 (95%CI = 1.08; 1.36); p = 0.001), progression to advanced fibrosis (F≥3) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51 (95%CI = 1.29; 4.88); p = 0.006) and progression to cirrhosis (F4) (OR = 2.71 (95%CI = 0.94; 5.03); p = 0.069). In multivariable analysis, the rs6897932 T allele was related to a higher increase of LSM values during follow-up (adjusted AMR = 1.27 (95%CI = 1.13; 1.42); p&amp;lt;0.001) and higher odds of progression to advanced fibrosis [adjusted OR = 4.46 (95%CI = 1.87; 10.62); p = 0.001], and progression to cirrhosis [adjusted OR = 3.92 (95%CI = 1.30; 11.77); p = 0.015]. Regarding &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and rs3194051 polymorphisms, we did not find significant results except for the relationship between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and the increase in LSM values [adjusted OR = 1.12 (95%CI = 1.02; 1.23); p = 0.015]. The &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs6897932 polymorphism seems to be related to increased risk of liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected patients.

Mounting evidence suggests that glycans, rather than merely serving as a “shield”, contribute critically to antigenicity of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein, representing critical antigenic determinants for many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). While many studies have focused on defining the role of individual glycans or groups of proximal glycans in bNAb binding, little is known about the effects of changes in the overall glycan landscape in modulating antibody access and Env antigenicity. Here we developed a systems glycobiology approach to reverse engineer the complexity of HIV glycan heterogeneity to guide antigenicity-based &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; glycoprotein design. bNAb binding was assessed against a panel of 94 recombinant gp120 monomers exhibiting defined glycan site occupancies. Using a Bayesian machine learning algorithm, bNAb-specific glycan footprints were identified and used to design antigens that selectively alter bNAb antigenicity as a proof-of concept. Our approach provides a new design strategy to predictively modulate antigenicity via the alteration of glycan topography, thereby focusing the humoral immune response on sites of viral vulnerability for HIV.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XbpST9Ne8uU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Exploiting glycan topography for computational design of Env glycoprotein antigenicity</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162e4229578:4d4f96:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Han Yu, Peng Zhao, Monia Draghi, Claudia Arevalo, Christina B.

In tomato, resistance to &lt;i&gt;Tomato spotted wilt virus&lt;/i&gt; (TSWV) is conferred by the dominant gene, designated Sw-5. Virulent Sw-5 resistance breaking (SRB) mutants of TSWV have been reported on Sw-5 tomato cultivars. Two different PCR-based allelic discrimination techniques, namely Custom TaqMan™ SNP Genotyping and high-resolution melting (HRM) assays, were developed and compared for their ability to distinguish between avirulent (Sw-5 non-infecting, SNI) and SRB biotypes. TaqMan assays proved to be more sensitive (threshold of detection in a range of 50–70 TSWV RNA copies) and more reliable than HRM, assigning 25 TSWV isolates to their correct genotype with an accuracy of 100%. Moreover, the TaqMan SNP assays were further improved developing a rapid and simple protocol that included crude leaf extraction for RNA template preparations. On the other hand, HRM assays showed higher levels of sensitivity than TaqMan when used to co-detect both biotypes in different artificial mixtures. These diagnostic assays contributed to gain preliminary information on the epidemiology of TSWV isolates in open field conditions. In fact, the presented data suggest that SRB isolates are present as stable populations established year round, persisting on both winter (globe artichoke) and summer (tomato) crops, in the same cultivated areas of Southern Italy.</content></content><title>Rapid identification of tomato Sw-5 resistance-breaking isolates of &amp;lt;i&gt;Tomato spotted wilt virus&amp;lt;/i&gt; using high resolution melting and TaqMan SNP Genotyping assays as allelic discrimination techniques</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e61:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina di Rienzo, Giovanni Bubici, Cinzia Montemurro, Fabrizio Cillo&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b00931&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, you can do hydrogenation reactions in a stainless-steel ball mill, without any sort of noble-metal catalyst. The hydrogen is produced when you add some n-alkane or diethyl ether to the mix (these actually get converted to gaseous methane and hydrogen under the milling conditions). Some pretty severe reductions are realized, for example, taking biphenyl all the way down to 1-cyclohexylcyclohexane. Olefins go to alkanes under these conditions, of course, and ketones and alcohols tend to just get erased: it’s a bulldozer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although it’s surprising, this reaction isn’t quite as much voodoo as it might appear. Well, not more than any other hydrogenation, anyway. The ball mill is, of course, a sealed vessel, and the authors show that the lower-boiling additives seem to be more effective, presumably because they increase the internal pressure. And it’s not like there’s no catalyst present, because you have the stainless steel. If you use zirconium oxide balls instead of the steel alloy ones, for example, you get no hydrogenation at all. Adding bits of different metals back in showed that the chromium is what’s producing the hydrogen from the alkanes or ether, while the nickel is acting as the hydrogenation catalyst itself. The stainless-steel alloy itself (304 steel) was the most effective combination, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balls do get eroded a bit under the conditions, so what you’ve got is finely divided metals, under some heat from the mechanical energy of the milling, and under hydrogen pressure from the decomposition of the co-reactants. No wonder things get reduced! But it’s not a reaction that you would have predicted up front. And even if you’d stipulated that hydrogenation would start under these conditions, I don’t think you would have guessed how powerful it would be. The last time I hydrogenated down a whole aryl system (it’s been a while), I was running at something like 1600 psi (110 bar) at 120C with a rhodium catalyst, and the stuff came out looking – and smelling – like old lawnmower oil. This reaction probably doesn’t get above 60 degrees, by contrast. Admittedly, there’s no word in the paper about the appearance or aroma of the crude products, but I’m willing to bet that that part remains the same. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Hydrogenating in a Ball Mill</title><unread>True</unread><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16344bbf04e:ab482a:93d646dc</id><description>Here’s one to add to the “weird mechanosynthesis” pile.

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to summarize and discuss the similarities and differences in inflammatory biomarkers in postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic retrieval of literature up to June 2017 in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and the Wanfang database was conducted. Extracted data were analyzed with STATA (version 14). The standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each indicator were calculated using a random effect model. We also performed tests of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, assessments of bias, and meta-regression in this meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 54 observational studies were included. By meta-analysis we found significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (9 studies, SMD 0.883, 95% CI 0.130 to 1.637, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 10 studies, SMD -0.133, 95% CI -0.512 to 0.246, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.429 in POCD) and interleukin (IL)-6 (7 studies, SMD 0.386, 95% CI 0.054 to 0.717, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 16 studies, SMD 0.089, 95% CI -0.133 to 0.311, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.433 in POCD) concentrations in both POD and POCD patients. We also found that the SMDs of CRP and IL-6 from POCD patients were positively correlated with surgery type in the meta-regression (CRP: Coefficient = 1.555365, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 10 studies; IL-6: Coefficient = -0.6455521, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.086, 16 studies).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Available evidence from medium-to-high quality observational studies suggests that POD and POCD are indeed correlated with the concentration of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers. Some of these markers, such as CRP and IL-6, play roles in both POD and POCD, while others are specific to either one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Inflammatory markers in postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD): A meta-analysis of observational studies</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3ca:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuling Liu, Yang Yu, Shengmei Zhu&lt;/p&gt;

Urbanization has been driven by various social, economic, and political factors around the world for centuries. Because urbanization continues unabated in many places, it is crucial to understand patterns of urbanization and their potential ecological and environmental impacts. Given this need, the objectives of our study were to quantify urban growth rates, growth modes, and resultant changes in the landscape pattern of urbanization in Hanoi, Vietnam from 1993 to 2010 and to evaluate the extent to which the process of urban growth in Hanoi conformed to the diffusion-coalescence theory. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of the built-up land in Hanoi using landscape expansion modes, spatial metrics, and a gradient approach. Urbanization was most pronounced in the periods of 2001–2006 and 2006–2010 at a distance of 10 to 35 km around the urban center. Over the 17 year period urban expansion in Hanoi was dominated by infilling and edge expansion growth modes. Our findings support the diffusion-coalescence theory of urbanization. The shift of the urban growth areas over time and the dynamic nature of the spatial metrics revealed important information about our understanding of the urban growth process and cycle. Furthermore, our findings can be used to evaluate urban planning policies and aid in urbanization issues in rapidly urbanizing countries.</content></content><title>Quantifying urban growth patterns in Hanoi using landscape expansion modes and time series spatial metrics</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4225f:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Duong H.

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests the presence of structural changes affecting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS). The aim of this study was to characterise the RV morphology in BrS and explore associations between morphologic, clinical, electrical, and genetic parameters using non-invasive multimodality testing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive BrS patients (recruited 2013–2015) underwent clinical assessment, dedicated RV imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (unless contra-indicated), electrical assessment (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG[SAECG]) and genotyping. Morphologic data were compared to matched control and unmatched ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) cohorts, and potential associations between morphologic parameters and other variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;BrS patients (n = 42, male 86%, age 46±12 years) exhibited normal global RV volume and function, comparable to control, in contrast to significantly larger, impaired RVs in ARVC cohort (RVESV p = 0.0001; RVEDV p&amp;lt;0.0001, RVEF p = 0.002). Compared with control, BrS patients exhibited larger RVOT volumes (7.4 ± 0.7 vs 5.8 ± 0.7 mL/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) (31% vs 0%, p = 0.005); compared with ARVC cohort, the RVOT volumes were similar (7.4 ± 0.7 vs, 8.1 ± 1.7, p = 0.52) and there were less RWMA (31% vs 76%, p = 0.01). Overall 67% BrS patients had abnormal RVOT morphology. Patients with abnormal RVOT tended to be older (48 ± 12 y vs 41 ± 12y, p = 0.06). Rare genetic variants were only observed in patients with abnormal RVOT morphology (36% vs 0%, p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with BrS frequently exhibit structural abnormalities localised to the RVOT and these changes may be age- and gene-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Relations between right ventricular morphology and clinical, electrical and genetic parameters in Brugada Syndrome</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179362a:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Belinda Gray, Ganesh Kumar Gnanappa, Richard D.

This research identifies which shots types in goalball are most likely to lead to a goal and herby provides background information for improving training and competition. Therefore, we observed 117 elite level matches including 20,541 shots played in the regular situation (3 vs. 3) using notational analysis. We characterized the shots by using their target sector (A-E), technique (traditional, rotation), trajectory (flat, bounce), angle (straight, diagonal and outcome (goal, violation, out, blocked). In our data, a χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-test showed a significantly higher goal rate for men (3.9%) compared to women (3.0%). For men, we found a significantly higher goal rate in the intersection sectors between players C (5.6%), D (4.9%), and in the outer sector A. In sector A, goal rate was higher only for straight shots (6.6%). Technique and trajectory did not affect goal rate for men, but flat shots showed a higher violation rate (3.2%) compared to bounce shouts (2.0%). In women&apos;s goalball, goal rate was higher only on sector D (4.4%). Bounce-rotation shots were the most successful (5.5%). We conclude that men should focus on shots to sectors C and D (called pocket) and straight shots to sector A, as long as there are no other tactical considerations. Women should shoot primarily towards the pocket. It might also be worth playing more bounce-rotation shots and practicing them in training.</content></content><title>Finding the gap: An empirical study of the most effective shots in elite goalball</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefc4:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Link, Christoph Weber&lt;/p&gt;

It might also be worth playing more bounce-rotation shots and practicing them in training.</description><crawled>1524765422632</crawled><fingerprint>aefefdd4</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196679</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196679</originId><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196679</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jae Hoon Jeong</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/ya5BjfgvpNQ/s41598-018-25265-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intracellular glycolysis in brown adipose tissue is essential for optogenetically induced nonshivering thermogenesis in mice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intracellular glycolysis in brown adipose tissue is essential for optogenetically induced nonshivering thermogenesis in mice, Published online: 27 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25265-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25265-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Intracellular glycolysis in brown adipose tissue is essential for optogenetically induced nonshivering thermogenesis in mice&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ya5BjfgvpNQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Intracellular glycolysis in brown adipose tissue is essential for optogenetically induced nonshivering thermogenesis in mice</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25265-3</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1630663ad5a:8c6939:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intracellular glycolysis in brown adipose tissue is essential for optogenetically induced nonshivering thermogenesis in mice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intracellular glycolysis in brown adipose tissue is essential for optogenetically induced nonshivering thermogenesis in mice, Published online: 27 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25265-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25265-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Intracellular glycolysis in brown adipose tissue is essential for optogenetically induced nonshivering thermogenesis in mice&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ya5BjfgvpNQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524820585818</crawled><fingerprint>98fdeb45</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25265-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25265-3</originId><published>1524812400000</published><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25265-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25265_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>379</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Kleijn, D., Biesmeijer, K., Dupont, Y.

The ability to simultaneously process and maintain multiple pieces of information is limited. Over the past 50 years, observational methods have provided a large amount of insight regarding the neural mechanisms that underpin the mental capacity that we refer to as “working memory.” More than 20 years ago, a neural coding scheme was proposed for working memory. As a result of technological developments, we can now not only observe but can also influence brain rhythms in humans. Building on these novel developments, we have begun to externally control brain oscillations in order to extend the limits of working memory.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZK-DqGkj6Do&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>On ways to overcome the magical capacity limit of working memory</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162df0f876e:4dc26a:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zsolt Turi, Ivan Alekseichuk, Walter Paulus&lt;/p&gt;

Several studies highlighted the relevance of extrinsic noise in shaping cell decision making and differentiation in molecular networks. Bimodal distributions of gene expression levels provide experimental evidence of phenotypic differentiation, where the modes of the distribution often correspond to different physiological states of the system. We theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this interaction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target transcription rate almost no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We investigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a fluctuating miRNA-transcription rate. We find that the presence of extrinsic noise favours the presence of bimodal target distributions which can be observed for a wider range of parameters compared to the case with intrinsic noise only and for lower miRNA-target interaction strength. Our results suggest that combining threshold-inducing interactions with extrinsic noise provides a simple and robust mechanism for obtaining bimodal populations without requiring fine tuning. Furthermore, we characterise the protein distribution’s dependence on protein half-life.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kcCJaIvDnzk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>On the role of extrinsic noise in microRNA-mediated bimodal gene expression</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d4ba762b:4bed5c:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Del Giudice, Stefano Bo, Silvia Grigolon, Carla Bosia&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore, we characterise the protein distribution’s dependence on protein half-life.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kcCJaIvDnzk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523987412523</crawled><fingerprint>c8b72dbc</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006063</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006063</originId><published>1523998800000</published><recrawled>1523997724770</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006063</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524517200000</updated><author><name>Sneha Mitra</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/vpyu8kjLjws/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sneha Mitra, Anushua Biswas, Leelavati Narlikar&lt;/p&gt;
Genome-wide in vivo protein-DNA interactions are routinely mapped using high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP-reported regions are typically investigated for enriched sequence-motifs, which are likely to model the DNA-binding specificity of the profiled protein and/or of co-occurring proteins. However, simple enrichment analyses can miss insights into the binding-activity of the protein. Note that ChIP reports regions making direct contact with the protein as well as those binding through intermediaries. For example, consider a ChIP experiment targeting protein X, which binds DNA at its cognate sites, but simultaneously interacts with four other proteins. Each of these proteins also binds to its own specific cognate sites along distant parts of the genome, a scenario consistent with the current view of transcriptional hubs and chromatin loops. Since ChIP will pull down all X-associated regions, the final reported data will be a union of five distinct sets of regions, each containing binding sites of one of the five proteins, respectively. Characterizing all five different motifs &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the corresponding sets is important to interpret the ChIP experiment and ultimately, the role of X in regulation. We present diversity which attempts exactly this: it partitions the data so that each partition can be characterized with its own de novo motif. Diversity uses a Bayesian approach to identify the optimal number of motifs and the associated partitions, which &lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt; explain the entire dataset. This is in contrast to standard motif finders, which report motifs &lt;i&gt;individually&lt;/i&gt; enriched in the data, but do not necessarily explain all reported regions. We show that the different motifs and associated regions identified by diversity give insights into the various complexes that may be forming along the chromatin, something that has so far not been attempted from ChIP data.

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.

According to cathepsin B hypothesis, mutated CTSB can lead to premature intracellular activation of trypsinogen, which is a key regulatory mechanism in pancreatitis. So far, CTSB mutations have been studied in pancreatitis and neurodegenerative disorders but little is known about the structural and functional effect of variants in CTSB. In this study, we investigated the effect of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with TCP, using molecular dynamics and simulation algorithms. There were two non-synonymous variants in the coding region (L26V and S53G) of CTSB, located in the propeptide region. We tried to predict the effect of these variants on structure and function using multiple algorithms: SIFT, Polyphen2, Panther, SDM sever, i-Mutant2.0 suite, mCSM algorithm and Vadar. Further, using databases like miRdbSNP, PolymiRTS and miRNASNP, two SNPs in 3-UTR region were predicted to affect the miRNA binding sites. Structural mutated models of nsSNP mutants (L26V and S53G) were prepared by MODELLER v9.15 and evaluated using TM-Align, Verify 3D, ProSA and Ramachandran plot. The results showed that the models (L26V and S53G) were of high accuracy. The 3D mutated structures were simulated using GROMACS 5.0 to predict the impact of these SNPs on protein stability. The results from in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these variants in the propeptide region of cathepsin B could lead to structural and functional changes in the protein.

The model of PFA0660w was subjected to docking with PfHsp70-x using Haddock to reveal a number of residues crucial for their bipartite interaction, and also performed MD simulations on the complex. The peptide binding clefts of PFA0660w and its other Plasmodium species homologs were found to be bigger than their counterparts in higher eukaryotes like yeast, humans and C. parvum. Based on our results, we propose a model for PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x interaction and a mechanism of substrate binding, and compare it with its dimeric human counterparts. Owing to these striking structural differences between the host and parasite chaperones, such information on the essential Hsp40 and its partner Hsp70 may form the basis for rational drug design against fatal malaria.</content></content><title>Structural insights into the binding mechanism of Plasmodium falciparum exported Hsp40-Hsp70 chaperone pair [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1631735df33:1e600d1:11c251fd</id><description>Expression of heat shock proteins in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) increases during febrile episodes to play key roles in several necessary cellular processes.

Understanding how knowledge is represented in the human brain is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. To date, most of the work on this topic has focused on knowledge representation in cortical areas and debated whether knowledge is represented in a distributed or localized fashion. Fang and colleagues provide evidence that brain connections and the white matter supporting such connections might play a significant role.

The work opens new avenues of investigation, breaking through disciplinary boundaries across network neuroscience, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and classical lesion studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YwDVYOi5evM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524765827736</crawled><fingerprint>74448a46</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005758</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005758</originId><published>1524776400000</published><recrawled>1524765902232</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005758</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jie Liu</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022466?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>An efficient implementation of semiempirical quantum-chemical orthogonalization-corrected methods for excited-state dynamics</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022466?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d1f:9f3b30f2</id><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><fingerprint>8d52184e</fingerprint><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022466?af=R</originId><published>1524229155000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Zahn, L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Stroke-induced immunodepression is a well characterized complication of acute ischemic stroke. In experimental studies beta-blocker therapy reversed stroke-induced immunodepression, reduced infection rates and mortality. Recent, heterogeneous studies in stroke patients could not provide evidence of a protective effect of beta-blocker therapy. Aim of this study is to investigate the potential preventive effect of beta-blockers in subgroups of patients at high risk for stroke-induced immunodepression.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from a prospectively derived registry of major stroke patients receiving endovascular therapy between 2011–2017 in a tertiary stroke center (University Medical Center Göttingen. Germany) was used. The effect of beta-blocker therapy on pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis and mortality was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three hundred six patients with a mean age of 72 ± 13 years and a median NIHSS of 16 (IQR 10.75–20) were included. 158 patients (51.6%) had pre-stroke- and continued beta-blocker therapy. Beta-blocker therapy did not reduce the incidence of pneumonia (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31–1.92, p = 0.584), urinary tract infections (OR 1.51, 0.88–2.60, p = 0.135), sepsis (OR 0.57, 0.18–1.80, p = 0.334) or mortality (OR 0.59, 0.16–2.17, p = 0.429). Strokes involving the insula and anterio-medial cortex increased the risk for pneumonia (OR 4.55, 2.41–8.56, p&amp;lt;0.001) and sepsis (OR 4.13, 1.81–9.43, p = 0.001), while right hemispheric strokes increased the risk for pneumonia (OR 1.60, 0.92–2.77, p = 0.096). There was a non-significantly increased risk for urinary tract infections in patients with beta-blocker therapy and insula/anterio-medial cortex strokes (OR 3.12, 95% CI 0.88–11.05, p = 0.077) with no effect of beta-blocker therapy on pneumonia, sepsis or mortality in both subgroups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In major ischemic stroke patients, beta-blocker therapy did not lower post-stroke infection rates and was associated with urinary tract infections in a subgroup with insula/anterio-medial strokes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Influence of beta-blocker therapy on the risk of infections and death in patients at high risk for stroke induced immunodepression</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b5:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ilko L.

Treatment with lysine deacetylase inhibitors (KDACi) for haematological malignancies, is accompanied by haematological side effects including thrombocytopenia, suggesting that modulation of protein acetylation affects normal myeloid development, and specifically megakaryocyte development. In the current study, utilising ex-&lt;i&gt;vivo&lt;/i&gt; differentiation of human CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells, we investigated the effects of two functionally distinct KDACi, valproic acid (VPA), and nicotinamide (NAM), on megakaryocyte differentiation, and lineage choice decisions. Treatment with VPA increased the number of megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEP), accompanied by inhibition of megakaryocyte differentiation, whereas treatment with NAM accelerated megakaryocyte development, and stimulated polyploidisation. Treatment with both KDACi resulted in no significant effects on erythrocyte differentiation, suggesting that the effects of KDACi primarily affect megakaryocyte lineage development. H3K27Ac ChIP-sequencing analysis revealed that genes involved in myeloid development, as well as megakaryocyte/erythroid (ME)-lineage differentiation are uniquely modulated by specific KDACi treatment. Taken together, our data reveal distinct effects of specific KDACi on megakaryocyte development, and ME-lineage decisions, which can be partially explained by direct effects on promoter acetylation of genes involved in myeloid differentiation.</content></content><title>Megakaryocyte lineage development is controlled by modulation of protein acetylation</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae6e:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marije Bartels, Anita Govers, Roel Polak, Stephin Vervoort, Ruben van Boxtel, Cornelieke Pals, Marc Bierings, Wouter van Solinge, Toine Egberts, Edward Nieuwenhuis, Michal Mokry, Paul James Coffer&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;In this qualitative study, we aimed to provide an in-depth exploration of cancer-related psychological distress experienced by young survivors of cancer during adolescence reporting a need for psychological support.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two individual interviews were held with ten young survivors of cancer diagnosed in adolescence. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Objective &lt;p&gt;In this qualitative study, we aimed to provide an in-depth exploration of cancer-related psychological distress experienced by young survivors of cancer during adolescence reporting a need for psychological support.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two individual interviews were held with ten young survivors of cancer diagnosed in adolescence. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis followed the guidelines for inductive qualitative manifest content analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The survivors described distress experienced during and after the end of treatment.

The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers delineate Class I and Class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d3:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Kaiser, Sebastian Bittrich, Sebastian Salentin, Christoph Leberecht, V.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</content></content><title>Genome-wide analysis of basic helix-loop-helix superfamily members in peach</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aed:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chunhua Zhang, Ruchao Feng, Ruijuan Ma, Zhijun Shen, Zhixiang Cai, Zhizhong Song, Bin Peng, Mingliang Yu&lt;/p&gt;

The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</description><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><fingerprint>5fa2e0ac</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</originId><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Elisa Pellegrino</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/sxLADR-eHQ8/s41598-018-24840-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Impact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Impact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field data, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24840-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24840-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Impact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field data&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/sxLADR-eHQ8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: Impact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field data</title><unread>True</unread><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162dad8751f:3ea39de:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Impact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Impact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field data, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24840-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24840-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Impact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field data&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/sxLADR-eHQ8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524090041631</crawled><fingerprint>ac7ea0fe</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24840-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24840-y</originId><published>1524121200000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24840-y</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>1.0</engagementRate><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Michael P.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) are indicated as first-line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Erlotinib is also used in second and third-line therapy for patients whose tumors have wild type EGFR but to date there are no validated biomarkers useful to identify which patients may benefit from this treatment. The expression level of four miRNAs: miR-133b, -146a, -7 and -21 which target EGFR was investigated by real-time PCR in tumor specimens from NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib administered as the second or third line. We found that miR-133b expression level better discriminated responder from non-responder patients to erlotinib. Higher levels of miR-133b in NSCLCs were associated with longer progression-free survival time of patients. Functional analyses on miR-133b through transfection of a miR-133b mimic in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines indicated that increasing miR-133b expression level led to a decreased cell growth and altered morphology but did not affect sensitivity to erlotinib. The detection of miR-133b expression levels in tumors help in the identification of NSCLC patients with a better prognosis and who are likely to benefit from second and third-line therapy with erlotinib.</content></content><title>Higher expression of miR-133b is associated with better efficacy of erlotinib as the second or third line in non-small cell lung cancer patients</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb0:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alessandra Bisagni, Maria Pagano, Sally Maramotti, Francesca Zanelli, Martina Bonacini, Elena Tagliavini, Luca Braglia, Massimiliano Paci, Andrea Mozzarelli, Stefania Croci&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) digitization technique for natural objects, such as insects and plants. The key idea is to combine X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photographs to obtain both complicated 3D shapes and surface textures of target specimens. We measure a specimen by using an X-ray CT device and a digital camera to obtain a CT volumetric image (volume) and multiple photographs. We then reconstruct a 3D model by segmenting the CT volume and generate a texture by projecting the photographs onto the model. To achieve this reconstruction, we introduce a technique for estimating a camera position for each photograph. We also present techniques for merging multiple textures generated from multiple photographs and recovering missing texture areas caused by occlusion. We illustrate the feasibility of our 3D digitization technique by digitizing 3D textured models of insects and flowers. The combination of X-ray CT and a digital camera makes it possible to successfully digitize specimens with complicated 3D structures accurately and allows us to browse both surface colors and internal structures.</content></content><title>Digitization of natural objects with micro CT and photographs</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d3:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ijiri, Hideki Todo, Akira Hirabayashi, Kenji Kohiyama, Yoshinori Dobashi&lt;/p&gt;

To date, the toxicity of ILs have been investigated by means of macroscopic assays aimed at characterizing the effective concentrations (like the EC50) that cause the dead of a significant fraction of the population of microorganisms and cells. These studies allowed to identify the cell membrane as the first target of the IL interaction, whose effectiveness was correlated to the lipophilicity of the cation, i.e. to the length of the lateral alkyl chain. Our study aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms of the toxicity of ILs. To this purpose, we carried out a combined topographic and mechanical analysis by Atomic Force Microscopy of living breast metastatic cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) upon interaction with imidazolium-based ILs. We showed that ILs are able to induce modifications of the overall rigidity (effective Young modulus) and morphology of the cells. Our results demonstrate that ILs act on the physical properties of the cell membrane, and possibly induce cytoskeletal reorganization, already at concentrations below the EC50. These potentially toxic effects are stronger at higher IL concentrations, as well as with longer lateral chains in the cation.</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Imidazolium-Based_Ionic_Liquids_Affect_Morphology_and_Rigidity_of_Living_Cells_an_Atomic_Force_Microscopy_Study/6216383</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids Affect Morphology and Rigidity of Living Cells: an Atomic Force Microscopy Study</title><crawled>1525361984783</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16326a8c50f:d46347:3dd877af</id><description>The study of the toxicity, biocompatibility, and environmental sustainability of room-temperature Ionic Liquids (ILs) is still in its infancy.

These studies allowed to identify the cell membrane as the first target of the IL interaction, whose effectiveness was correlated to the lipophilicity of the cation, i.e. to the length of the lateral alkyl chain. Our study aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms of the toxicity of ILs. To this purpose, we carried out a combined topographic and mechanical analysis by Atomic Force Microscopy of living breast metastatic cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) upon interaction with imidazolium-based ILs. We showed that ILs are able to induce modifications of the overall rigidity (effective Young modulus) and morphology of the cells. Our results demonstrate that ILs act on the physical properties of the cell membrane, and possibly induce cytoskeletal reorganization, already at concentrations below the EC50. These potentially toxic effects are stronger at higher IL concentrations, as well as with longer lateral chains in the cation.</description><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>c7c412d2</fingerprint><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Imidazolium-Based_Ionic_Liquids_Affect_Morphology_and_Rigidity_of_Living_Cells_an_Atomic_Force_Microscopy_Study/6216383</originId><published>1525305600000</published><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Imidazolium-Based_Ionic_Liquids_Affect_Morphology_and_Rigidity_of_Living_Cells_an_Atomic_Force_Microscopy_Study/6216383</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>We report that Histone Deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) controls the thymic effector programming of Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, and that interference with this function contributes to tissue-specific autoimmunity.

The Morris water maze test (MWM) is a useful tool to evaluate rodents’ spatial learning and memory, but the outcome is susceptible to various experimental conditions. Thigmotaxis is a commonly observed behavioral pattern which is thought to be related to anxiety or fear. This behavior is associated with prolonged escape latency, but the impact of its frequency in the early stage on the final outcome is not clearly understood. We analyzed swim path trajectories in male C57BL/6 mice with or without bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis. As the next step, we made a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize the swim path trajectories. Our model could distinguish thigmotaxis from other trajectories with 96% accuracy and specificity as high as 0.98. These results suggest that thigmotaxis in the early training stage is a predictive factor for impaired performance in MWM, and machine learning can detect such behavior easily and automatically.</content></content><title>Recognition of early stage thigmotaxis in Morris water maze test with convolutional neural network</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af6:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akinori Higaki, Masaki Mogi, Jun Iwanami, Li-Juan Min, Hui-Yu Bai, Bao-Shuai Shan, Harumi Kan-no, Shuntaro Ikeda, Jitsuo Higaki, Masatsugu Horiuchi&lt;/p&gt;

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has short- and long- term influence on pregnant women and fetus. Swimming, as an aerobic exercise, can effectively improve the blood glucose level in GDM, but the effect of mild swimming alone was not very substantial. Metformin, as an oral antidiabetic drug, has obvious hypoglycemic effect, and is economic also, but the long-term effect on pregnant women and fetus has not been completely clear. We hypothesize that combined intervention of mild swimming and low dose of metformin, may effectively reduce blood glucose, improve the pregnancy outcomes in GDM dams, but simultaneously avoiding the adverse effects caused by overdose of drug and impotence of mild swimming. The streptozotocin was used to stimulate C57BL/6J mice to develop GDM, by which serum glucose, TC, TG, LDL-C were increased significantly, meanwhile HDL-C was decreased significantly in the GDM control (DC) group compared with the normal control group. Swimming or metformin intervention slightly or moderately improves hyperglycemia, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice, while combined therapy of swimming plus metformin markedly ameliorated hyperglycemia (FPG, decreased by 22.2–59.5% from G10 to G18 versus DC group), insulin sensitivity (2.1 and 2.8 fold increase, respectively, in AKT activity versus DC group) and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; lipogenesis (3.2 and 7.0 fold decrease, respectively, in ACC activity, and 1.94 and 5.1 fold decrease, respectively, in SREBP2 level, versus DC group) both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice. We conclude that the combined intervention by metformin plus swimming may be more effective than single action to ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; improving insulin sensitivity in GDM mice.</content></content><title>Combined intervention of swimming plus metformin ameliorates the insulin resistance and impaired lipid metabolism in murine gestational diabetes mellitus</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f7:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liping Huang, Pingping Yue, Xuefei Wu, Ting Yu, Yang Wang, Ji Zhou, Derun Kong, Keyang Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Swimming or metformin intervention slightly or moderately improves hyperglycemia, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice, while combined therapy of swimming plus metformin markedly ameliorated hyperglycemia (FPG, decreased by 22.2–59.5% from G10 to G18 versus DC group), insulin sensitivity (2.1 and 2.8 fold increase, respectively, in AKT activity versus DC group) and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; lipogenesis (3.2 and 7.0 fold decrease, respectively, in ACC activity, and 1.94 and 5.1 fold decrease, respectively, in SREBP2 level, versus DC group) both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice. We conclude that the combined intervention by metformin plus swimming may be more effective than single action to ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; improving insulin sensitivity in GDM mice.</description><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><fingerprint>bcdbc13d</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195609</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195609</originId><published>1524258000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195609</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00129/20180410/images/medium/mp-2018-001295_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00129&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In this work, we assess a previously advanced hypothesis that predicts the existence of ion channels in the capsid of small and non-enveloped icosahedral viruses. With this purpose we examine &lt;i&gt;Triatoma Virus&lt;/i&gt; (TrV) as a case study. This virus has a stable capsid under highly acidic conditions but disassembles and releases the genome in alkaline environments. Our calculations range from a subtle sub-atomic proton interchange to the dismantling of a large-scale system representing several million of atoms. Our results provide structure-based explanations for the three roles played by the capsid to enable genome release. First, we observe, for the first time, the formation of a hydrophobic gate in the cavity along the five-fold axis of the wild-type virus capsid, which can be disrupted by an ion located in the pore. Second, the channel enables protons to permeate the capsid through a unidirectional Grotthuss-like mechanism, which is the most likely process through which the capsid senses pH. Finally, assuming that the proton leak promotes a charge imbalance in the interior of the capsid, we model an internal pressure that forces shell cracking using coarse-grained simulations. Although qualitatively, this last step could represent the mechanism of capsid opening that allows RNA release. All of our calculations are in agreement with current experimental data obtained using TrV and describe a cascade of events that could explain the destabilization and disassembly of similar icosahedral viruses.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HAp1mwq20rY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Multiscale modelization in a small virus: Mechanism of proton channeling and its role in triggering capsid disassembly</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d0:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Francisco Viso, Patricia Belelli, Matías Machado, Humberto González, Sergio Pantano, María Julia Amundarain, Fernando Zamarreño, Maria Marta Branda, Diego M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to generate an ultrasonic nanobubble (NB)-mediated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/fludarabine suicide gene system for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;NBs were prepared from a mixture the phospholipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPA), perfluoropropane gas and other materials using the high shear dispersion method. NBs treated with ultrasound irradiation functioned as a gene-transfer system, and a self-constructed suicide gene expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP, treated with fludarabine functioned as a therapeutic gene. This system was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of PNP/fludarabine on HepG2 cells and SMMC7721 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1. NBs with a small diameter (208–416 nm) and at a high concentration and fine homogeneity were prepared under the optimal method. 2. The pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP plasmid was efficiently transfected into HCC cells using ultrasonic NBs. 3. At 0.75μg/ml fludarabine, PNP/fludarabine showed marked cytotoxic effects toward HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. PNP/fludarabine achieved the same effect against both SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells but at a lower concentration of fludarabine for the latter. 4.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to generate an ultrasonic nanobubble (NB)-mediated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/fludarabine suicide gene system for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;NBs were prepared from a mixture the phospholipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPA), perfluoropropane gas and other materials using the high shear dispersion method. NBs treated with ultrasound irradiation functioned as a gene-transfer system, and a self-constructed suicide gene expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP, treated with fludarabine functioned as a therapeutic gene. This system was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of PNP/fludarabine on HepG2 cells and SMMC7721 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1. NBs with a small diameter (208–416 nm) and at a high concentration and fine homogeneity were prepared under the optimal method. 2. The pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP plasmid was efficiently transfected into HCC cells using ultrasonic NBs. 3. At 0.75μg/ml fludarabine, PNP/fludarabine showed marked cytotoxic effects toward HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. PNP/fludarabine achieved the same effect against both SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells but at a lower concentration of fludarabine for the latter. 4. Bystander effects: a 10–20% decrease in the cell survival rate was observed when only 5–10% of transfected cells were PNP positive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;NBs constitute a non-toxic, stable and effective gene-delivery platform. The PNP/fludarabine suicide gene system inhibited the growth of HCC cells, induced HCC cell apoptosis, and caused a notable bystander effect at a low fludarabine concentration. This study establishes an important new method for miniaturizing microbubbles and improving a new NB-mediated approach for gene therapy of HCC.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><fingerprint>849a7e78</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</originId><published>1525294800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Lin Zhu</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/9b5pXIhYOtY/s41598-018-24460-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Involvement of AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) in Regulation of Cell Membrane Potential in a Gastric Cancer Cell Line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involvement of AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) in Regulation of Cell Membrane Potential in a Gastric Cancer Cell Line, Published online: 16 April 2018;

Repeated concussion is becoming increasingly recognized as a serious public health concern around the world. Moreover, there is a greater awareness amongst health professionals of the potential for repeated pediatric concussions to detrimentally alter the structure and function of the developing brain. To better study this issue, we developed an awake closed head injury (ACHI) model that enabled repeated concussions to be performed reliably and reproducibly in juvenile rats. A neurological assessment protocol (NAP) score was generated immediately after each ACHI to help quantify the cumulative effects of repeated injury on level of consciousness, and basic motor and reflexive capacity. Here we show that we can produce a repeated ACHI (4 impacts in two days) in both male and female juvenile rats without significant mortality or pain. We show that both single and repeated injuries produce acute neurological deficits resembling clinical concussion symptoms that can be quantified using the NAP score. Behavioural analyses indicate repeated ACHI acutely impaired spatial memory in the Barnes maze, and an interesting sex effect was revealed as memory impairment correlated moderately with poorer NAP score performance in a subset of females. These cognitive impairments occurred in the absence of motor impairments on the Rotarod, or emotional changes in the open field and elevated plus mazes. Cresyl violet histology and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that repeated ACHI did not produce significant structural damage. MRI also confirmed there was no volumetric loss in the cortex, hippocampus, or corpus callosum of animals at 1 or 7 days post-ACHI. Together these data indicate that the ACHI model can provide a reliable, high throughput means to study the effects of concussions in juvenile rats.</content></content><title>Repeated mild traumatic brain injury can cause acute neurologic impairment without overt structural damage in juvenile rats</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506e:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Meconi, Ryan C.

The Salmon louse (&lt;i&gt;Lepeophtheirus salmonis&lt;/i&gt;) is a marine ectoparasite of salmonid fish in the Northern Hemisphere and considered as a major challenge in aquaculture and a threat to wild populations of salmonids. Adult female lice produce a large number of lipid-rich eggs, however, the mechanism of maternal lipid transport into developing eggs during salmon louse reproduction has not been described. In the present study, a full-length &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt; lipophorin receptor (&lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt;) consisting of 16 exons was obtained by RACE and RT-PCR. The predicted ORF was 952 amino acids and structural analysis showed five functional domains that are similar to LpR of insects and decapods. Phylogenetic analysis placed the LsLpR together with LpRs from decapods and insects. Expression analysis revealed that the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts was highest in the larvae and adult female lice. In adult females, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts and protein were found in the ovary and vitellogenic oocytes whereas, in larvae, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts were found in the neuronal somata of the brain and the intestine. Oil Red O stain results revealed that storage of neutral lipids was found in vitellogenic oocytes and ovaries of adult females, and in the yolk of larvae. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) was conducted to demonstrate the function of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; in reproduction and lipid metabolism in &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt;. In larvae, the transcription of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; was decreased by 44–54% while in an experiment &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; knockdown female lice produced 72% less offspring than control lice.</content></content><title>Molecular characterization of the lipophorin receptor in the crustacean ectoparasite &amp;lt;i&gt;Lepeophtheirus salmonis&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c8:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Tanveer Khan, Sussie Dalvin, Qaiser Waheed, Frank Nilsen, Rune Male&lt;/p&gt;

Data regarding the clinical outcomes of the BVS versus DES beyond 2 years are emerging.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study mid-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched online databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, CENTRAL), several websites, meeting presentations and scientific session abstracts until August 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2017 for studies comparing Absorb BVS with second-generation DES. The primary outcome was target lesion failure (TLF). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and definite/probable device thrombosis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using a random effects model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten studies, seven randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies, with a total of 7320 patients (BVS n = 4007; DES n = 3313) and a median follow-up duration of 30.5 months, were included. Risk of TLF was increased for BVS-treated patients (OR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.12–1.60], p = 0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). This was also the case for all myocardial infarction (1.58 [95% CI: 1.27–1.96], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), TLR (1.48 [95% CI: 1.19–1.85], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%) and definite/probable device thrombosis (of 2.82 (95% CI: 1.86–3.89], p&amp;lt;0.001 and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 40.3%). This did not result in a difference in all-cause mortality (0.78 [95% CI: 0.58–1.04], p = 0.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). OR for very late (&gt;1 year) device thrombosis was 6.10 [95% CI: 1.40–26.65], p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;At mid-term follow-up, BVS was associated with an increased risk of TLF, MI, TLR and definite/probable device thrombosis, but this did not result in an increased risk of all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Mid-term outcomes of the Absorb BVS versus second-generation DES: A systematic review and meta-analysis</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee3:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cordula M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Acute gastroenteritis illness is a common illness that causes considerable morbidity, but current estimates of the cost to the Australian healthcare system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the current healthcare utilisation and direct public healthcare system costs attributable to acute gastroenteritis illness in Australia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is an incidence-based cost-of-illness study focused on quantifying direct health care costs using a bottom-up approach. Data on general practitioner consultations, prescribed medications, diagnostic tests, specialist consultations, emergency department visits and hospital admissions were collected from national reports.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2016 prices, the estimated annual direct per capita cost of acute gastroenteritis illness was AUD$14.87 (USD$10.71), equating to AUD$20.27 (USD$14.59) per case. The estimated overall economic burden in Australia was AUD$359 million (USD$258 million; AUD$1.5 million per 100,000 people). The major contributors to this cost were hospital admissions (57.1%), emergency department visits (17.7%), and general practitioner consultations (14.0%). Children under five years of age have the highest per capita rates of acute gastroenteritis illness; however, service utilisation rates vary by age group and both young children and older adults accounted for a substantial proportion of the overall economic burden attributable to acute gastroenteritis illness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although chronic diseases comprise a large cost burden on the healthcare system, acute illnesses, including acute gastroenteritis illness, also impose substantial direct healthcare system costs.

Goat breeding has become an important sector in Eastern Europe, with Romania and Hungary being among the major producer countries. Given the limited number of research done up-to-date concerning genetic studies of indigenous goat breeds reared in Romania and Hungary, the current preliminary study aimed to analyze the variability of genes related to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP™). We studied 52 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to 19 genes in indigenous breeds from both countries, namely Banat’s White (n = 36), Carpatina (n = 35) from Romania and Hungarian Milking (n = 79) and identified 16 polymorphic SNPs among 10 genes (&lt;i&gt;PTX3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLEC4E&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNFSF13&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TNF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TLR3&lt;/i&gt;) in 150 animals. Furthermore, the diversity of the studied breeds was investigated. The PIC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.691. The mean values of observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.235 and 0.246 respectively. The highest observed heterozygosity was obtained for &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T in Banat’s White (0.464), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T in Carpatina (0.577) and &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G in Hungarian Milking (0.588). Pairwise F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values between the Romanian breeds and Romanian and Hungarian breeds were small (0.009 and 0.015), indicating the close relationship among the studied goat populations. From all the polymorphic SNPs identified, the Hungarian Milking breed showed the highest proportion of polymorphisms (100%), whereas the Carpatina breed had the lowest percentage (87.5%). The highest value of MAF was obtained for &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G (0.46), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T (0.47), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10344025C&gt;T (0.45), and &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T (0.42). The 16 polymorphic SNPs identified in a panel of 150 unrelated individuals belonging to three Romanian and Hungarian indigenous goat breeds could be used in future genomic based breeding schemes as markers for genetic resistance to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism in goat breeds found in Eastern and Central Europe.</content></content><title>Genetic characterization of indigenous goat breeds in Romania and Hungary with a special focus on genetic resistance to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism based on 40 SNPs</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bede:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Elena Ilie, Szilvia Kusza, Maria Sauer, Dinu Gavojdian&lt;/p&gt;

The highest value of MAF was obtained for &lt;i&gt;SOCS3&lt;/i&gt; g.52626440T&gt;G (0.46), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10343904C&gt;T (0.47), &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10344025C&gt;T (0.45), and &lt;i&gt;IL15RA&lt;/i&gt; g.10354813C&gt;T (0.42). The 16 polymorphic SNPs identified in a panel of 150 unrelated individuals belonging to three Romanian and Hungarian indigenous goat breeds could be used in future genomic based breeding schemes as markers for genetic resistance to mastitis and gastrointestinal parasitism in goat breeds found in Eastern and Central Europe.</description><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><fingerprint>60f02547</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197051</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197051</originId><published>1525899600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197051</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524862800000</updated><author><name>Augusto C.

Our aims were to quantify and map the plant sub regions of the the Caatinga, that covers 844,453 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is the largest block of seasonally dry forest in South America. We performed spatial analyses of the largest dataset of woody plant distributions in this region assembled to date (of 2,666 shrub and tree species; 260 localities), compared these distributions with the current phytogeographic regionalizations, and investigated the potential environmental drivers of the floristic patterns in these sub regions. Phytogeographical regions were identified using quantitative analyses of species turnover calculated as Simpson dissimilarity index. We applied an interpolation method to map NMDS axes of compositional variation over the entire extent of the Caatinga, and then classified the compositional dissimilarity according to the number of biogeographical sub regions identified a priori using k-means analysis. We used multinomial logistic regression models to investigate the influence of contemporary climatic productivity, topographic complexity, soil characteristics, climate stability since the last glacial maximum, and the human footprint in explaining the identified sub regions. We identified nine spatially cohesive biogeographical sub regions. Current productivity, as indicated by an aridity index, was the only explanatory variable retained in the best model, explaining nearly half of the floristic variability between sub regions. The highest rates of endemism within the Caatinga were in the Core and Periphery Chapada Diamantina sub regions. Our findings suggest that the topographic complexity, soil variation, and human footprint in the Caatinga act on woody plant distributions at local scales and not as determinants of broad floristic patterns. The lack of effect of climatic stability since the last glacial maximum probably results from the fact that a single measure of climatic stability does not adequately capture the highly dynamic climatic shifts the region suffered during the Pleistocene. There was limited overlap between our results and previous Caatinga classifications.</content></content><title>Aridity drives plant biogeographical sub regions in the Caatinga, the largest tropical dry forest and woodland block in South America</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d73d:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Augusto C.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>The impact of being bullied at school on psychological distress and work engagement in a community sample of adult workers in Japan</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559154:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;

The main objective of this work was to quantify and update the U.S. Midwest agricultural state of Iowa’s contribution of nitrate-nitrogen to the Mississippi River stream network against the backdrop of the ongoing problem of Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. To achieve this objective, we used stream nitrate and discharge data collected from 1999 until 2016 at 23 Iowa stream sites near watershed outlets, along with publicly-available data for sites downstream of Iowa on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Our analysis shows that Iowa contributes between 11 and 52% of the long-term nitrate load to the Mississippi-Atchafalaya Basin, 20 to 63% to the Upper Mississippi River Basin, and 20 to 89% to the Missouri River Basin, with averages of 29, 45 and 55% respectively. Since 1999, nitrate loads in the Iowa-inclusive basins have increased and these increases do not appear to be driven by changes in discharge and cropping intensity unique to Iowa. The 5-year running annual average of Iowa nitrate loading has been above the 2003 level for ten consecutive years, implying that Gulf hypoxic areal goals, also based on a 5-year running annual average, will be very difficult to achieve if nitrate retention cannot be improved in Iowa. An opportunity exists for land managers, policy makers and conservationists to manifest a positive effect on water quality by targeting and implementing nitrate reducing-practices in areas like Iowa while avoiding areas that are less likely to affect Gulf of Mexico hypoxia.</content></content><title>Iowa stream nitrate and the Gulf of Mexico</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66db:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher S.

An opportunity exists for land managers, policy makers and conservationists to manifest a positive effect on water quality by targeting and implementing nitrate reducing-practices in areas like Iowa while avoiding areas that are less likely to affect Gulf of Mexico hypoxia.</description><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>fb3f2429</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195930</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195930</originId><published>1523566800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195930</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524171600000</updated><author><name>Mesay Hailu Dangisso</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196432</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mesay Hailu Dangisso, Endrias Markos Woldesemayat, Daniel Gemechu Datiko, Bernt Lindtjørn&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Correction: Long-term outcome of smear-positive tuberculosis patients after initiation and completion of treatment: A ten-year retrospective cohort study</title><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196432</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7911:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mesay Hailu Dangisso, Endrias Markos Woldesemayat, Daniel Gemechu Datiko, Bernt Lindtjørn&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><fingerprint>52d1fa5a</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196432</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196432</originId><published>1524171600000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>2</engagement><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Travers Ching</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/eSnsuldF9z0/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Travers Ching, Xun Zhu, Lana X.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing architectures with many interconnections of simple neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets, Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

In higher plants, ω-3 fatty acid desaturases are the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3), which plays key roles in plant metabolism as a structural component of both storage and membrane lipids. Here, the first ω-3 fatty acid desaturase gene was identified and characterized from oil palm. The bioinformatic analysis indicated it encodes a temperature-sensitive chloroplast ω-3 fatty acid desaturase, designated as &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt;. The expression analysis revealed that &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in the oil palm leaves, when compared with the expression in the mesocarp. The heterologous expression of &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; in yeast resulted in the production of a novel fatty acid 18:3 (about 0.27%), when fed with 18:2 in the induction culture. Furthermore, to detect whether &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; could be induced by the environment stress, we detected the expression efficiency of the &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis treated with low temperature and darkness, respectively. The results indicated that the promoter of &lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&lt;/i&gt; gene could be significantly induced by low temperature and slightly induced by darkness. These results reveal the function of EgFAD8 and the feature of its promoter from oil palm fruits, which will be useful for understanding the fuction and regulation of plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturases in higher plants.</content></content><title>Identification and characterization of a plastidial ω-3 fatty acid desaturase &amp;lt;i&gt;EgFAD8&amp;lt;/i&gt; from oil palm (&amp;lt;i&gt;Elaeis guineensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; Jacq.) and its promoter response to light and low temperature</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae81:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lizhi Chen, Lei Wang, Herong Wang, Ruhao Sun, Lili You, Yusheng Zheng, Yijun Yuan, Dongdong Li&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O104:H4, a hybrid pathotype reported in a large 2011 foodborne outbreak in Germany, has not been detected in cattle feces. However, cattle harbor and shed in the feces other O104 serotypes, particularly O104:H7, which has been associated with sporadic cases of diarrhea in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the virulence potential of Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) O104:H7 isolated from feces of feedlot cattle using DNA microarray. Six strains of STEC O104:H7 isolated from cattle feces were analyzed using FDA-&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; Identification (ECID) DNA microarray to determine their virulence profiles and compare them to the human strains (clinical) of O104:H7, STEC O104:H4 (German outbreak strain), and O104:H21 (milk-associated Montana outbreak strain). Scatter plots were generated from the array data to visualize the gene-level differences between bovine and human O104 strains, and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were determined. Splits tree was generated to analyze relatedness between the strains. All O104:H7 strains, both bovine and human, similar to O104:H4 and O104:H21 outbreak strains were negative for intimin (&lt;i&gt;eae&lt;/i&gt;). The bovine strains were positive for Shiga toxin 1 subtype c (&lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;1c), enterohemolysin (&lt;i&gt;ehxA&lt;/i&gt;), tellurite resistance gene (&lt;i&gt;terD&lt;/i&gt;), IrgA homolog protein (&lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;), type 1 fimbriae (&lt;i&gt;fimH&lt;/i&gt;), and negative for genes that code for effector proteins of type III secretory system. The six cattle O104 strains were closely related (r = 0.86–0.98) to each other, except for a few differences in phage related and non-annotated genes. One of the human clinical O104:H7 strains (2011C-3665) was more closely related to the bovine O104:H7 strains (r = 0.81–0.85) than the other four human clinical O104:H7 strains (r = 0.75–0.79). Montana outbreak strain (O104:H21) was more closely related to four of the human clinical O104:H7 strains than the bovine O104:H7 strains.

&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O104:H4, a hybrid pathotype reported in a large 2011 foodborne outbreak in Germany, has not been detected in cattle feces. However, cattle harbor and shed in the feces other O104 serotypes, particularly O104:H7, which has been associated with sporadic cases of diarrhea in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the virulence potential of Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) O104:H7 isolated from feces of feedlot cattle using DNA microarray. Six strains of STEC O104:H7 isolated from cattle feces were analyzed using FDA-&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; Identification (ECID) DNA microarray to determine their virulence profiles and compare them to the human strains (clinical) of O104:H7, STEC O104:H4 (German outbreak strain), and O104:H21 (milk-associated Montana outbreak strain). Scatter plots were generated from the array data to visualize the gene-level differences between bovine and human O104 strains, and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were determined. Splits tree was generated to analyze relatedness between the strains. All O104:H7 strains, both bovine and human, similar to O104:H4 and O104:H21 outbreak strains were negative for intimin (&lt;i&gt;eae&lt;/i&gt;). The bovine strains were positive for Shiga toxin 1 subtype c (&lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;1c), enterohemolysin (&lt;i&gt;ehxA&lt;/i&gt;), tellurite resistance gene (&lt;i&gt;terD&lt;/i&gt;), IrgA homolog protein (&lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;), type 1 fimbriae (&lt;i&gt;fimH&lt;/i&gt;), and negative for genes that code for effector proteins of type III secretory system.

Background &lt;p&gt;The comparison between long acting insulin analogues (LAIA) and human insulin (NPH) has been investigated for decades, with many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews giving mixed results. This overlapping and contradictory evidence has increased uncertainty on coverage decisions at health systems level.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To conduct an overview of systematic reviews and update existing reviews, preparing new meta-analysis to determine whether LAIA are effective for T1D patients compared to NPH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified systematic reviews of RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of LAIA glargine or detemir, compared to NPH insulin for T1D, assessing glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and hypoglycemia. Data sources included Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and hand-searching. The methodological quality of studies was independently assessed by two reviewers, using AMSTAR and Jadad scale. We found 11 eligible systematic reviews that contained a total of 25 relevant clinical trials. Two reviewers independently abstracted data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found evidence that LAIA are efficacious compared to NPH, with estimates showing a reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia episodes (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.57; 0.76) and A1C (95% CI 0.23; 0.12). No significance was found related to severe hypoglycemia (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.71; 1.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study design has allowed us to carry out the most comprehensive assessment of RCTs on this subject, filling a gap in diabetes research.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In sub-Saharan Africa foodborne disease and foodborne disease outbreaks are frequently ascribed to poor personal hygiene of street food vendors and food handlers in food establishments. Evidence on the level of food hygiene practices and food safety measures among food handlers is required for proper planning and implementation of targeted interventions. In this study, we aimed to determine the level of food hygiene and safety measures among street food vendors and food handlers in food establishments of Dessie Town, Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A community-based cross-sectional study was performed in Dessie town, Ethiopia from December 2013 to June 2014. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and an observational checklist by a trained data collector among 116 food handlers from 116 food establishments and 19 food handlers from 19 street food vendors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to identify the factors significantly associated with good level of food hygiene and safety practices.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Almost three-quarter (72%; 84/116) of food handlers in food establishments had a good level of food hygiene and safety practices compared to nearly half (53%; 10/19) of street food vendors. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Average monthly income of &gt;$21 US (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.2; 95%CI: 1.3–7.7), availability of service training (AOR = 6.7; 95%CI: 1.8–25), wearing a gown during food handling (AOR = 19; 95%CI: 6.8–51) and medical checkup (AOR = 5.2; 95%CI: 2.1–13) were significantly associated with good levels of food hygiene and safety measures.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Comprehensive health education and promotion programs through continuous training on food hygiene and safety, with promotion of wearing gown during food handling, regular medical checkups of food handlers and programs that enhance the monthly income of food handlers are promising strategies for promoting proper food handling practices in Dessie town, Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Food hygiene and safety measures among food handlers in street food shops and food establishments of Dessie town, Ethiopia: A community-based cross-sectional study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aef:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Metadel Adane, Brhanu Teka, Yirga Gismu, Goitom Halefom, Muluneh Ademe&lt;/p&gt;

Average monthly income of &gt;$21 US (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.2; 95%CI: 1.3–7.7), availability of service training (AOR = 6.7; 95%CI: 1.8–25), wearing a gown during food handling (AOR = 19; 95%CI: 6.8–51) and medical checkup (AOR = 5.2; 95%CI: 2.1–13) were significantly associated with good levels of food hygiene and safety measures.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Comprehensive health education and promotion programs through continuous training on food hygiene and safety, with promotion of wearing gown during food handling, regular medical checkups of food handlers and programs that enhance the monthly income of food handlers are promising strategies for promoting proper food handling practices in Dessie town, Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><fingerprint>951a23ae</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196919</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196919</originId><published>1525381200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196919</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Shujun Wang</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/J5Yp533wOBg/s41598-018-24180-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: New insights into gelatinization mechanisms of cereal endosperm starches&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: New insights into gelatinization mechanisms of cereal endosperm starches, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24180-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24180-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: New insights into gelatinization mechanisms of cereal endosperm starches&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/J5Yp533wOBg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: New insights into gelatinization mechanisms of cereal endosperm starches</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24180-x</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162cda398f0:2887002:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: New insights into gelatinization mechanisms of cereal endosperm starches&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: New insights into gelatinization mechanisms of cereal endosperm starches, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24180-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24180-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: New insights into gelatinization mechanisms of cereal endosperm starches&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/J5Yp533wOBg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523868473584</crawled><fingerprint>39403180</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24180-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24180-x</originId><published>1523862000000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1526072400000</updated><author><name>Alfred Obia</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alfred Obia, Jan Mulder, Sarah Elizabeth Hale, Neneng Laela Nurida, Gerard Cornelissen&lt;/p&gt;
Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses. Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</content></content><title>The potential of biochar in improving drainage, aeration and maize yields in heavy clay soils</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f69:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfred Obia, Jan Mulder, Sarah Elizabeth Hale, Neneng Laela Nurida, Gerard Cornelissen&lt;/p&gt;

Heterotrophic marine nanoflagellates are important grazers on bacteria in the water column. Some marine bacteria appear more resistant to grazing than do others. Marine nanoflagellates can be grown in the laboratory in batch cultures fed specific bacterial isolates. In some cultures, the flagellates appear unable to completely deplete the bacterial prey even when the bacterial strain otherwise is an excellent prey. This may indicate that some marine bacteria are able to induce defence mechanisms if they are grazed by nanoflagellates. Four morphologically distinct marine heterotrophic nanoflagellates, of which 3 were still identified as &lt;i&gt;Procryptobia sorokini&lt;/i&gt; (Kinetoplastea) and one as &lt;i&gt;Paraphysomonas imperforata&lt;/i&gt; (Chrysophyceae) were isolated from a coastal location along with 3 isolates of the marine bacterium &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. Flagellate growth and grazing on bacterial prey were analysed in batch cultures. &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; was a suitable prey for all 4 flagellate isolates. They grazed and grew on &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; as sole prey with maximal cell-specific growth rates of 0.1–0.25 h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and gross growth efficiencies of 38–61%. Exposure to dense flagellate cultures or their supernatants did, however, cause a fraction of the &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; cells to aggregate and the bacterium became apparently resistant to grazing. Concentrations of suspended &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; cells were therefore not decreased below 1,700–7,500 cells μL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; by any of the flagellate isolates. These results indicate that &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. can be an excellent prey to marine nanoflagellates but also that is in possession of inducible mechanisms that protect against flagellate grazing.</content></content><title>Feeding and growth of the marine heterotrophic nanoflagellates, &amp;lt;i&gt;Procryptobia sorokini&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Paraphysomonas imperforata&amp;lt;/i&gt; on a bacterium, &amp;lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&amp;lt;/i&gt; sp. with an inducible defence against grazing</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363a:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jakob Tophøj, Rasmus Dam Wollenberg, Teis Esben Sondergaard, Niels Thomas Eriksen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&lt;/i&gt; is endemic to China and is a new fruit tree species with economic and environmental benefits, with potential developmental and utilization applications. We report the first complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;. Its genome is 158,084 bp in size, and the overall GC content is 36.8%. An inverted repeats (IR) of 52,672 bp in size is separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region of 86,374 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 19,038 bp. The chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; contains 131 genes including 90 protein-coding genes, 33 transfer RNA genes, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. The genome has a total 510 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Of these, 306, 149, and 55 were found in the LSC, IR, and SSC regions, respectively. In addition, a comparison of the boundaries of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions of ten other &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species exhibited an overall high degree of sequence similarity, with slight variations in the IR boundary region which included gene deletions, insertions, expansions, and contractions. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; lost the &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRA/SSC border and it has the largest &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRB/SSC border among these &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species, whereas the &lt;i&gt;rps19&lt;/i&gt; gene was inserted at the IRB/LSC junction. Furthermore, phylogenetic reconstruction using 61 conserved coding-protein genes clustered &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Prunus tomentosa&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; provides a rich source of genetic information for studies on &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; taxonomy, phylogeny, and evolution, as well as lays the foundation for further development and utilization of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><title>The chloroplast genome of &amp;lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&amp;lt;/i&gt;: Genomic characterization and phylogenetic analysis</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7708:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaopeng Mu, Pengfei Wang, Junjie Du, Yu Gary Gao, Jiancheng Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; provides a rich source of genetic information for studies on &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; taxonomy, phylogeny, and evolution, as well as lays the foundation for further development and utilization of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;.</description><crawled>1524679026474</crawled><fingerprint>3962f85c</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196473</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196473</originId><published>1524690000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196473</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Huifang Deng</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/K10BCdIfFGs/s41598-018-24361-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seroprevalence of &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; in pregnant women and livestock in the mainland of China: a systematic review and hierarchical meta-analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seroprevalence of &amp;lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&amp;lt;/i&gt; in pregnant women and livestock in the mainland of China: a systematic review and hierarchical meta-analysis, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24361-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24361-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Seroprevalence of &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; in pregnant women and livestock in the mainland of China: a systematic review and hierarchical meta-analysis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/K10BCdIfFGs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in pregnant women and livestock in the mainland of China: a systematic review and hierarchical meta-analysis</title><unread>True</unread><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d80dcfbd:399b48e:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seroprevalence of &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; in pregnant women and livestock in the mainland of China: a systematic review and hierarchical meta-analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seroprevalence of &amp;lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&amp;lt;/i&gt; in pregnant women and livestock in the mainland of China: a systematic review and hierarchical meta-analysis, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24361-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24361-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Seroprevalence of &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; in pregnant women and livestock in the mainland of China: a systematic review and hierarchical meta-analysis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/K10BCdIfFGs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524043206589</crawled><fingerprint>b9dd5bb1</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24361-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24361-8</originId><published>1524034800000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24361-8</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1525381200000</updated><author><name>Katherine Bradbury</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196868</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine Bradbury, Katherine Morton, Rebecca Band, Anne van Woezik, Rebecca Grist, Richard J.

Background &lt;p&gt;For behaviour-change interventions to be successful they must be acceptable to users and overcome barriers to behaviour change. The Person-Based Approach can help to optimise interventions to maximise acceptability and engagement. This article presents a novel, efficient and systematic method that can be used as part of the Person-Based Approach to rapidly analyse data from development studies to inform intervention modifications. We describe how we used this approach to optimise a digital intervention for patients with hypertension (HOME BP), which aims to implement medication and lifestyle changes to optimise blood pressure control.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In study 1, hypertensive patients (N = 12) each participated in three think-aloud interviews, providing feedback on a prototype of HOME BP. In study 2 patients (N = 11) used HOME BP for three weeks and were then interviewed about their experiences. Studies 1 and 2 were used to identify detailed changes to the intervention content and potential barriers to engagement with HOME BP. In study 3 (N = 7) we interviewed hypertensive patients who were not interested in using an intervention like HOME BP to identify potential barriers to uptake, which informed modifications to our recruitment materials. Analysis in all three studies involved detailed tabulation of patient data and comparison to our modification criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Studies 1 and 2 indicated that the HOME BP procedures were generally viewed as acceptable and feasible, but also highlighted concerns about monitoring blood pressure correctly at home and making medication changes remotely. Patients in study 3 had additional concerns about the safety and security of the intervention. Modifications improved the acceptability of the intervention and recruitment materials.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This paper provides a detailed illustration of how to use the Person-Based Approach to refine a digital intervention for hypertension.

Coal mining has led to increasingly serious land subsidence, and the reclamation of the subsided land has become a hot topic of concern for governments and scholars. Soil quality of reclaimed land is the key indicator to the evaluation of the reclamation effect; hence, rapid monitoring and evaluation of reclaimed land is of great significance. Visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy has been shown to be a rapid, timely and efficient tool for the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC). In this study, 104 soil samples were collected from the Baodian mining area of Shandong province. Vis-NIR reflectance spectra and soil organic carbon content were then measured under laboratory conditions. The spectral data were first denoised using the Savitzky-Golay (SG) convolution smoothing method or the multiple scattering correction (MSC) method, after which the spectral reflectance (R) was subjected to reciprocal, reciprocal logarithm and differential transformations to improve spectral sensitivity. Finally, regression models for estimating the SOC content by the spectral data were constructed using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that: (1) The SOC content in the mining area was generally low (at the below-average level) and exhibited great variability. (2) The spectral reflectance increased with the decrease of soil organic carbon content. In addition, the sensitivity of the spectrum to the change in SOC content, especially that in the near-infrared band of the original reflectance, decreased when the SOC content was low. (3) The modeling results performed best when the spectral reflectance was preprocessed by Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing coupled with multiple scattering correction (MSC) and first-order differential transformation (modeling R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.86, RMSE = 2.00 g/kg, verification R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.78, RMSE = 1.81 g/kg, and RPD = 2.69). In addition, the first-order differential of R combined with SG, MSC with R, SG together with MSC and R also produced better modeling results than other pretreatment combinations. Vis-NIR modeling with specific spectral preprocessing methods could predict SOC content effectively.</content></content><title>Prediction of soil organic carbon in a coal mining area by Vis-NIR spectroscopy</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e805:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wenjuan Sun, Xinju Li, Beibei Niu&lt;/p&gt;

Angiogenesis has been implicated in glomerular alterations in the early stage of diabetic nephropathy. We previously reported the renoprotective effects of vasohibin-1 (VASH1), which is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor derived from endothelial cells, on diabetic nephropathy progression. Vasohibin-2 (VASH2) was originally identified as a VASH1 homolog and possesses pro-angiogenic activity in contrast to VASH1. In addition, VASH2 was recently shown to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via enhanced transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling in cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the pathogenic roles of VASH2 in diabetic nephropathy using VAHS2-deficient mice. The type 1 diabetes model was induced by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin in VASH2 homozygous knockout (VASH2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/LacZ&lt;/sup&gt;) or wild-type mice. These mice were euthanized 16 weeks after inducing hyperglycemia. Increased urine albumin excretion and creatinine clearance observed in diabetic wild-type mice were significantly prevented in diabetic VASH2-deficient mice. Accordingly, diabetes-induced increase in glomerular volume and reduction in glomerular slit-diaphragm density were significantly improved in VASH2 knockout mice. Increased glomerular endothelial area was also suppressed in VASH2-deficient mice, in association with inhibition of enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2), but not VEGF level.

Angiogenesis has been implicated in glomerular alterations in the early stage of diabetic nephropathy. We previously reported the renoprotective effects of vasohibin-1 (VASH1), which is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor derived from endothelial cells, on diabetic nephropathy progression. Vasohibin-2 (VASH2) was originally identified as a VASH1 homolog and possesses pro-angiogenic activity in contrast to VASH1. In addition, VASH2 was recently shown to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via enhanced transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling in cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the pathogenic roles of VASH2 in diabetic nephropathy using VAHS2-deficient mice. The type 1 diabetes model was induced by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin in VASH2 homozygous knockout (VASH2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/LacZ&lt;/sup&gt;) or wild-type mice. These mice were euthanized 16 weeks after inducing hyperglycemia. Increased urine albumin excretion and creatinine clearance observed in diabetic wild-type mice were significantly prevented in diabetic VASH2-deficient mice. Accordingly, diabetes-induced increase in glomerular volume and reduction in glomerular slit-diaphragm density were significantly improved in VASH2 knockout mice. Increased glomerular endothelial area was also suppressed in VASH2-deficient mice, in association with inhibition of enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2), but not VEGF level. Furthermore, glomerular accumulation of mesangial matrix, including type IV collagen, and increased expression of TGF-β were improved in diabetic VASH2 knockout mice compared with diabetic wild-type mice. Based on the immunofluorescence findings, endogenous VASH2 localization in glomeruli was consistent with mesangial cells. Human mesangial cells (HMCs) were cultured under high glucose condition in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments. Transfection of VASH2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) into the HMCs resulted in the suppression of type IV collagen production induced by high glucose compared with control siRNA. These results indicate that VASH2 may be involved in diabetes-induced glomerular alterations, particularly impaired filtration barrier and mesangial expansion. Therefore, VASH2 is likely to represent a promising therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy.</description><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><fingerprint>8c50a8de</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195779</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195779</originId><published>1523480400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195779</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Laura G.

Inflammation causes nociceptive sensory neuron activation, evoking debilitating symptoms and reflexes. Inflammatory signaling pathways are capable of modulating mitochondrial function, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization and calcium release. Previously we showed that mitochondrial modulation with antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, selectively stimulated nociceptive bronchopulmonary C-fibers via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1) cation channels. TRPA1 is ROS-sensitive, but there is little evidence that TRPV1 is activated by ROS. Here, we used dual imaging of dissociated vagal neurons to investigate the correlation of mitochondrial superoxide production (mitoSOX) or mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1) with cytosolic calcium (Fura-2AM), following mitochondrial modulation by antimycin A, rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, mitochondrial uncoupling agent). Mitochondrial modulation by all agents selectively increased cytosolic calcium in a subset of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing (A1/V1+) neurons. There was a significant correlation between antimycin A-induced calcium responses and mitochondrial superoxide in wild-type ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons, which was eliminated in TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nevertheless, antimycin A-induced superoxide production did not always increase calcium in A1/V1+ neurons, suggesting a critical role of an unknown factor. CCCP caused both superoxide production and mitochondrial depolarization but neither correlated with calcium fluxes in A1/V1+ neurons. Rotenone-induced calcium responses in ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons correlated with mitochondrial depolarization but not superoxide production. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction causes calcium fluxes in a subset of A1/V1+ neurons via ROS-dependent and ROS-independent mechanisms.</content></content><title>Mitochondrial modulation-induced activation of vagal sensory neuronal subsets by antimycin A, but not CCCP or rotenone, correlates with mitochondrial superoxide production</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4226b:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine R.

To elucidate the association between renal hyperfiltration (RHF) and incident proteinuria, the data from 11,559,520 Korean adults who had undergone health screenings ≥ 3 times between 2009 and 2014 and had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and negative dipstick test for proteinuria at baseline, were retrospectively analyzed. GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine, and RHF was defined as GFR &gt;95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile adjusted for sex, age, body size, and diabetes and/or hypertension medication. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of incident proteinuria in the RHF was 1.083 (95% CI, 1.069~1.097) compared to that of the non-RHF with Cox regression model. The association between RHF and incident proteinuria was not only in diabetic but also in non-diabetic subjects. This association was not observed in women (p for interaction &amp;lt;0.001). A reverse J-shaped association was found between the adjusted GFR slope and aHR of incident proteinuria. Both lower and higher GFR were associated with incident proteinuria in men.

To elucidate the association between renal hyperfiltration (RHF) and incident proteinuria, the data from 11,559,520 Korean adults who had undergone health screenings ≥ 3 times between 2009 and 2014 and had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and negative dipstick test for proteinuria at baseline, were retrospectively analyzed. GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine, and RHF was defined as GFR &gt;95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile adjusted for sex, age, body size, and diabetes and/or hypertension medication. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of incident proteinuria in the RHF was 1.083 (95% CI, 1.069~1.097) compared to that of the non-RHF with Cox regression model. The association between RHF and incident proteinuria was not only in diabetic but also in non-diabetic subjects. This association was not observed in women (p for interaction &amp;lt;0.001). A reverse J-shaped association was found between the adjusted GFR slope and aHR of incident proteinuria. Both lower and higher GFR were associated with incident proteinuria in men. In conclusion, RHF was associated with incident proteinuria in men. Clinical studies are necessary to study whether the alleviation of RHF can prevent incident proteinuria.</description><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>d150fda6</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195784</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195784</originId><published>1523653200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195784</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Yoshihiro Hirooka</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/kfcmLCuOb0w/s41598-018-24369-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parameterization of the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) using a plant canopy analyzer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parameterization of the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) in rice (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.) using a plant canopy analyzer, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24369-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24369-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parameterization of the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) using a plant canopy analyzer&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/kfcmLCuOb0w&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Parameterization of the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) using a plant canopy analyzer</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24369-0</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162f1d1745e:5d84120:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parameterization of the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) using a plant canopy analyzer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parameterization of the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) in rice (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.) using a plant canopy analyzer, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24369-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24369-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parameterization of the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) using a plant canopy analyzer&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/kfcmLCuOb0w&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524475458654</crawled><fingerprint>8ca789b8</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24369-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24369-0</originId><published>1524466800000</published><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24369-0/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24369_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>347</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>685</height></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00213/20180510/images/medium/mp-2018-00213p_0012.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00213&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria.

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria. The highest larval mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was 99% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (bNN112.3_TH) at 96 h, and the highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was 98% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (bNN121.4_TH) at 96 h.

Animal welfare requires the adequate housing of animals to ensure health and well-being. The application of environmental enrichment is a way to improve the well-being of laboratory animals. However, it is important to know whether these enrichment items can be incorporated in experimental mouse husbandry without creating a divide between past and future experimental results. Previous small-scale studies have been inconsistent throughout the literature, and it is not yet completely understood whether and how enrichment might endanger comparability of results of scientific experiments. Here, we measured the effect on means and variability of 164 physiological parameters in 3 conditions: with nesting material with or without a shelter, comparing these 2 conditions to a “barren” regime without any enrichments. We studied a total of 360 mice from each of 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6NTac and DBA/2NCrl) and both sexes for each of the 3 conditions. Our study indicates that enrichment affects the mean values of some of the 164 parameters with no consistent effects on variability. However, the influence of enrichment appears negligible compared to the effects of other influencing factors. Therefore, nesting material and shelters may be used to improve animal welfare without impairment of experimental outcome or loss of comparability to previous data collected under barren housing conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Dd6wtkaJG8Q&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Laboratory mouse housing conditions can be improved using common environmental enrichment without compromising data</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162cf7703c6:e8c8c5:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viola André, Christine Gau, Angelika Scheideler, Juan A.

Digital image processing is widely used in the non-destructive diagnosis of plant nutrition. Previous plant nitrogen diagnostic studies have mostly focused on characteristics of the rice canopy or leaves at some specific points in time, with the long sampling intervals unable to provide detailed and specific “dynamic features.” According to plant growth mechanisms, the dynamic changing rate in leaf shape and color differ between different nitrogen supplements. Therefore, the objective of this study was to diagnose nitrogen stress levels by analyzing the dynamic characteristics of rice leaves. Scanning technology was implemented to collect rice leaf images every 3 days, with the characteristics of the leaves from different leaf positions extracted utilizing MATLAB. Newly developed shape characteristics such as etiolation area (EA) and etiolation degree (ED), in addition to shape (area, perimeter) and color characteristics (green, normalized red index, etc.), were used to quantify the process of leaf change. These characteristics allowed sensitive indices to be established for further model validation. Our results indicate that the changing rates in dynamic characteristics, in particular the shape characteristics of the first incomplete leaf (FIL) and the characteristics of the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; leaf (leaf color and etiolation indices), expressed obvious distinctions among different nitrogen treatments. Consequently, we achieved acceptable diagnostic accuracy (training accuracy 77.3%, validation accuracy 64.4%) by using the FIL at six days after leaf emergence, and the new shape characteristics developed in this article (ED and EA) also showed good performance in nitrogen diagnosis. Based on the aforementioned results, dynamic analysis is valuable not only in further studies but also in practice.</content></content><title>Nitrogen diagnosis based on dynamic characteristics of rice leaf image</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa8:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanyuan Sun, Shaochun Zhu, Xuan Yang, Melanie Valerie Weston, Ke Wang, Zhangquan Shen, Hongwei Xu, Lisu Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, patchy interstitial fibrosis and diffuse microvascular abnormalities. In IPF, alveolar clustering of iron-laden alveolar macrophages—a common sign of microhemorrhage, has been associated with vascular abnormalities and worsening of pulmonary hypertension. As iron-dependent ROS generation has been shown to induce unrestrained macrophage activation in disease models of vascular damage, we explored alveolar macrophage activation phenotype in IPF patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (CTR, n = 7) by RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. The frequencies of macrophages in BAL cells were 86+4% and 83.4+8% in IPF and CTR groups, respectively (p-value = 0.41). In IPF patients, BAL cells showed increased iron-dependent ROS generation (p-value&amp;lt;0.05 vs CTR). Gene expression analysis showed overrepresentation of Gene Ontology processes/functions and KEGG pathways enriched in upregulated M1-type inflammatory (p-value&amp;lt;0.01), M2-type anti-inflammatory/tissue remodeling (p-value&amp;lt;0.0001), and MTPP-type chronic inflammatory/angiogenic (p-value&amp;lt;0.0001) chemokine and cytokine genes. The &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; finding was confirmed by the induction of iron-dependent ROS generation and chemokine/cytokine overexpression of Ccl4, Cxcl10 (M1), Il1rn (M2), Cxcl2, and Cxcl7 (MTPP) in MH-S murine immortalized alveolar macrophages exposed to ferric ammonium citrate in culture (p-value&amp;lt;0.05 vs CTR). The data show alveolar macrophage expression of a pro-inflammatory, tissue remodeling and angiogenic complex activation pattern, suggesting that iron accumulation may play a role in macrophage activation.</content></content><title>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis express a complex pro-inflammatory, pro-repair, angiogenic activation pattern, likely associated with macrophage iron accumulation</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc712d:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jungnam Lee, Ivan Arisi, Ermanno Puxeddu, Lazarus K.

Dopamine synthesizing (DA) neurons in the brain play a vital role in the addiction to cocaine. But the underlying molecular mechanisms that help cocaine exert its addictive effect have not been very well understood. Bioinformatics can be a useful tool in the attempt to broaden our understanding in this area.

Dopamine synthesizing (DA) neurons in the brain play a vital role in the addiction to cocaine. But the underlying molecular mechanisms that help cocaine exert its addictive effect have not been very well understood. Bioinformatics can be a useful tool in the attempt to broaden our understanding in this area. In the present study, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was carried out on the upregulated genes from a dataset of DA neurons of post-mortem human brain of cocaine addicts. As a result of this analysis, 3 miRNAs have been identified as having significant influence on transcription of the upregulated genes.
