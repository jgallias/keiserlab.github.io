The Old World farming system arose in the semi-arid Mediterranean environments of southwest Asia. Pioneer farmers settling the interior of the Balkans by the early sixth millennium BC were among the first to introduce southwest Asian-style cultivation and herding into areas with increasingly continental temperate conditions. Previous research has shown that the bioarchaeological assemblages from early farming sites in southeast Europe vary in their proportions of plant and animal taxa, but the relationship between taxonomic variation and climate has remained poorly understood. To uncover associations between multiple species and environmental factors simultaneously, we explored a dataset including altitude, five bioclimatic and 30 bioarchaeological variables (plant and animal taxa) for 57 of the earliest farming sites in southeast Europe using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). An extension of correspondence analysis, CCA is widely used in applied ecology to answer similar questions of species-environment relationships, but has not been previously applied in prehistoric archaeology to explore taxonomic and climatic variables in conjunction. The analyses reveal that the changes in plant and animal exploitation which occurred with the northward dispersal of farmers, crops and livestock correlate with south-north climate gradients, and emphasize the importance of adaptations in the animal domain for the initial establishment of farming beyond the Mediterranean areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Ivanova, Bea De Cupere, Jonathan Ethier, Elena Marinova&lt;/p&gt;

A group at Merck (Boston) reports a combination of very small-scale automated synthesis with a screening assay in situ (no purification). You may be wondering how that works, or how it can possibly work, especially when you hear that the nanoscale reactions are transition-metal catalyzed. After all, we usually spend a good deal of effort trying to make sure that our assay candidates are cleaned up and (most especially) free of metal contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is the type of protein assay. It’s not a functional readout, which is where the metals can give you all sorts of false positives, but rather just a binding assay, done by mass spec. That’s generally done in an is-anything-there binary mode, but in this paper, they’re actually titrating in the amount of protein to get a rough order of affinities. Still, one strike against that sort of detection has always been “But you’re only measuring binding, not real inhibition, etc.” That’s still true, but now you can always consider going the targeted protein degradation route, in which case all you need is some sort of binder. As mentioned here in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/26/dna-libraries-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;another recent post&lt;/a&gt;, the same consideration applies to DNA-encoded libraries, which also just give you a binding affinity readout – the Merck authors don’t mention this aspect, but it’s a real consideration these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, they did a test with 20 reactions each using amide formation, Suzuki couplings, and Buchwald-Hartwig C-N couplings (which certainly cover a lot of real-world medicinal chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/24/boring-or-the-medicinal-chemists-toolkit&quot;&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;).  They used the small-scale reaction setup to screen conditions for the latter two, in a smaller-scale version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. In each case, they also synthesized the products on a 20mg scale and purified them by traditional means, in order to compare them with the nanoscale assay results. (These all produced compounds in known kinase inhibitor space, which I’m afraid is also pretty realistic.) And the correlation was strong: the affinity-mass-spec assay could indeed pick out the potent compounds (as it should) without giving false positives along the way (since you’re looking for the particular mass signature of the product associated with the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this confirmation in hand, the group then took one of the intermediates and coupled it in each individual well of a 384 plate after an automated reaction conditions screen. They got 345 products and rank-ordered them by titrating in CHK1 protein, with a mass spec readout each time, and identified three new potent binders. These reactions are done on about 0.05mg of material each, so you can plow through quite a few of them without plowing through a lot of starting material, and generate a lot of SAR data rather quickly. The reaction screening is a key part of the process – taking robust but generic coupling conditions across that same 384 set only gave 158 products (and thus missed several nanomolar inhibitors). Overall, to optimize the 384 set and assay them took 3114 reactions, consuming about 120mg of the starting material. You are not going to be able to do that by hand. I don’t care how much of a machine you are in the lab, you’re not more of a machine than a machine is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, machine-learning algorithms may eventually make it easier to navigate both reaction condition space and SAR space, but for now, we really have to attack these things empirically, and this (in general) seems like the way to do it. Small scale, highly automated, optimized, high-throughput: you’re not going to be able to sort things so thoroughly any other way. And since we often have to resort to brute force, we should be letting the machines take that on whenever possible, because brute force is exactly what they do the best. That was proven on the high-throughput screening end of the business many years ago, and it’s true on the compound synthesis end of things, too. Bring ’em on.&lt;/p&gt;

Diminishing the cost of broiler chicken diet is a critical issue in the poultry industry. Numerous studies were performed to achieve this pivotal objective by diet supplementation with alternative feed additives. In the current study, low-energy broiler rations were supplemented with different commercial multienzyme formulations to minimize the cost, and increase the digestibility and absorption of the digested macronutrients. Cobb Avian 48 broiler chicks (mixed sex, 1-d-old, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3120) were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was subdivided into four replicates (130 birds per replicate). The birds were randomly allocated into a control group fed basal diet (CB); control group fed low-energy diet (CL); and birds fed low-energy diets supplemented with different enzyme formulations. The enzyme formulations used were Xylam 500&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLX group), Hemicell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLH group), Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLA group), and Megazyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLM group,) following the doses recommended by the manufacturers. The growth performance of CLA and CLH group birds was significantly improved when compared with CL. In comparison with CB, Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) increased the intestinal &lt;i&gt;PEPT1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GLUT2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ACC&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-2&lt;/i&gt; expression; PEPT1 facilitates the absorption of micronutrients. In conclusion, exogenous multienzyme complexes may be included in the low-energy diet to enhance the performance of broiler chickens (Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; ˃ Hemicell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; ˃ Megazyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;), and reduce the diet cost by up-regulating the expression of intestinal nutrient transporter genes, and improving the immunity and serum biochemical parameters of broiler chickens.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ahmed A.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was the largest in history. Starting in September 2014, International Medical Corps (IMC) operated five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in Sierra Leone and Liberia. This paper explores how future infectious disease outbreak facilities in resource-limited settings can be planned, organized, and managed by analyzing data collected on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and infection prevention control (IPC) protocols.&lt;/p&gt; Design/Methodology/Approach &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analyzing WASH/IPC activity data routinely recorded on paper forms or white boards at ETUs during the outbreak and later merged into a database from two IMC-run ETUs in Sierra Leone between December 2014 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The IMC WASH/IPC database contains data from over 369 days. Our results highlight parameters key to designing and maintaining an ETU. High concentration chlorine solution usage was highly correlated with both daily patient occupancy and high-risk zone staff entries; low concentration chlorine usage was less well explained by these measures. There is high demand for laundering and disinfecting of personal protective equipment (PPE) on a daily basis and approximately 1 (0–4) piece of PPE is damaged each day.&lt;/p&gt; Research limitations/Implications &lt;p&gt;Lack of standardization in the type and format of data collected at ETUs made constructing the WASH/IPC database difficult.

Only the effects of recipient diagnosis and donor age were constant; effects of other covariates varied over time. We retained identical covariates in the graft survival model but found several differences in their impact.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The flexibility afforded by Gray’s TVC estimation methods identify several covariates that do not satisfy constant proportionality assumptions of the Cox PH model.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Although locally invasive or recurrent fibromatosis is primarily treated with surgery, radiotherapy (RT) produces local control for recurrent/unresectable tumors or those with positive surgical margins. Herein, we describe our updated institutional experience with RT to treat fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven patients with fibromatosis received RT between 1990 and 2015, and were followed for ≥12 months. Eight patients received RT for gross tumors, and 39 received postoperative RT after single/multiple prior surgeries. A median dose of 54 Gy was prescribed for definitive RT; 48.6, 50.4, and 54 Gy were prescribed for R0, R1, and R2 resected tumors, respectively. Recurrences were classified as in-field, marginal, or out-field. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven recurrences were noted, including 2 in-field, 4 marginal, and 1 out-field, after a median follow-up of 60 months. In-field recurrences occurred in 1 patient who received 40.5 Gy of salvage RT after postoperative recurrence and another who received 45 Gy for R1 resection after multiple prior operations. All marginal failures were due to insufficient clinical target volume (CTV) margins regardless of dose (3 with 45 Gy and 1 with 54 Gy).

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Although locally invasive or recurrent fibromatosis is primarily treated with surgery, radiotherapy (RT) produces local control for recurrent/unresectable tumors or those with positive surgical margins. Herein, we describe our updated institutional experience with RT to treat fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven patients with fibromatosis received RT between 1990 and 2015, and were followed for ≥12 months. Eight patients received RT for gross tumors, and 39 received postoperative RT after single/multiple prior surgeries. A median dose of 54 Gy was prescribed for definitive RT; 48.6, 50.4, and 54 Gy were prescribed for R0, R1, and R2 resected tumors, respectively. Recurrences were classified as in-field, marginal, or out-field. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven recurrences were noted, including 2 in-field, 4 marginal, and 1 out-field, after a median follow-up of 60 months. In-field recurrences occurred in 1 patient who received 40.5 Gy of salvage RT after postoperative recurrence and another who received 45 Gy for R1 resection after multiple prior operations. All marginal failures were due to insufficient clinical target volume (CTV) margins regardless of dose (3 with 45 Gy and 1 with 54 Gy). On multivariate analysis, a CTV margin ≥5 cm and dose &gt;45 Gy were significant predictors of non-recurrence (p = 0.039 and 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with both an CTV margin ≥5 cm and a dose &gt;45 Gy showed a favorable outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RT is a valuable option for treating aggressive fibromatosis; doses ≥45 Gy and a large field produce optimal results. For in-field control, a higher dose is more necessary for gross residual tumors than for totally excised lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><title>Optimal radiotherapy strategy for primary or recurrent fibromatosis and long-term results</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198134</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198134</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c22:3dd877af</id><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</originId><fingerprint>9c388810</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05137-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Microbes weaken host’s immune response by triggering pain neurons.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05137-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Microbes weaken host’s immune response by triggering pain neurons.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>51</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05137-6</link><crawled>1525974815445</crawled><visual><height>576</height><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05137-6/d41586-018-05137-6_15749214.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1634b2fd2d5:1526271:3dd877af</id><published>1525935600000</published><title>Flesh-eating bacteria thrive on pain</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197262</originId><fingerprint>88567546</fingerprint><author><name>Valeriy Kuznyetsov</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197262</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Valeriy Kuznyetsov, Svetlana Madjunkova, Ran Antes, Rina Abramov, Gelareh Motamedi, Zenon Ibarrientos, Clifford Librach&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess whether embryonic DNA isolated from blastocyst culture conditioned medium (BCCM) combined with blastocoel fluid (BF) could be used for blastocyst stage non-invasive preimplantation genetic testing for chromosomal aneuploidy (non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening, NIPGS).&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;47 embryos from 35 patients undergoing IVF.&lt;/p&gt; Interventions &lt;p&gt;DNA analysis of combined BCCM plus BF in comparison with trophectoderm (TE) biopsy and/or whole blastocyst (WB)using next generation sequencing (NGS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Embryonic DNA was successfully amplified in 47/47 NIPGS samples (28 frozen-thawed and 19 fresh culture samples) ranging from 6.3 to 44.0 ng/μl. For frozen-thawed embryos, the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample was equivalent between NIPGS vs. TE biopsy, NIPGS vs. WB and TE vs. WB samples taken from the same embryo was 87.5%; 96.4% and 91.7% respectively (P&gt;0.05), and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 99.3%, 99.7% and 99.7%, respectively (P&gt;0.05). In fresh cases (Day 4 to Day 5/6 culture), the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample between NIPGS vs. TE samples taken from the same embryo was 100%, and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 98.2% (P&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A combination of BCCM and BF contains sufficient embryonic DNA for whole genome amplification and accurate aneuploidy screening.

Access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains deficient without an adequate workforce. There is limited understanding of the gender gap in surgical trainees in LMICs. In Rwanda, females fill only one of 20 positions available. Understanding surgeons’ experiences and perceptions of surgical careers may help facilitate support for females to contribute to the global surgical workforce. We performed qualitative analysis on perceptions of surgical careers through semi-structured interviews of all female surgeons (n = 6) and corresponding male surgeons (n = 6) who are training or have trained at University of Rwanda. Transcripts were analyzed with code structure formed through an integrated approach. Question categories formed the deductive framework, while theoretical saturation was reached through inductive grounded theory. Themes were organized within two key points of the career timeline. First, for developing interest in surgery, three main themes were identified: role models, patient case encounters, and exposure to surgery. Second, for selecting and sustaining surgical careers, four main themes emerged: social expectations about roles within the family, physical and mental challenges, professional and personal support, and finances. All female surgeons emphasized gender assumptions and surgical working culture as obstacles, with a corresponding strong sense of self-confidence and internal motivation that drew them to select and maintain careers in surgery. Family, time, and physical endurance were cited as persistent challenges for female participants. Our study reveals concepts for further exploration about gendered perceptions of surgical careers. Efforts to improve support for female surgical careers as a strategy for shaping surgical work culture and professional development in Rwanda should be considered. Such strategies may be beneficial for improving the global surgical workforce.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sojung Yi, Yihan Lin, Grace Kansayisa, Ainhoa Costas-Chavarri&lt;/p&gt;

Aluminum-based adjuvants have widely been used in human vaccines since 1926. In the absence of antigens, aluminum-based adjuvants can initiate the inflammatory preparedness of innate cells, yet the impact of antigens on this response has not been investigated so far. In this study, we address the modulating effect of vaccine antigens on the monocyte-derived innate response by comparing processes initiated by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and by Infanrix, an Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-adjuvanted trivalent combination vaccine (DTaP), containing diphtheria toxoid (D), tetanus toxoid (T) and acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine antigens. A systems-wide analysis of stimulated monocytes was performed in which full proteome analysis was combined with targeted transcriptome analysis and cytokine analysis. This comprehensive study revealed four major differences in the monocyte response, between plain Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation conditions: (I) DTaP increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; did not; (II) Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increased the gene expression of &lt;i&gt;IFNγ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;IL-17a&lt;/i&gt; in contrast to the limited induction or even downregulation by DTaP; (III) increased expression of type I interferons-induced proteins was not observed upon DTaP stimulation, but was observed upon Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation; (IV) opposing regulation of protein localization pathways was observed for Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation, related to the induction of exocytosis by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alone.

Background &lt;p&gt;Telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL-TL) was proposed as a biomarker of cancer risk. Recent scientific evidence suggested PBL-TL plays a diverse role in different cancers. Inconsistent results were obtained on PBL-TL in relation to breast cancer risk and specifically to the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The aim of the present case-control study was to analyse the correlation between family history of breast cancer or presence of a BRCA mutation and PBL-TL in the hypothesis that TL is a modifier of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;PBL-TL was measured using the real-time quantitative PCR method in DNA for 142 cases and 239 controls. All the women enrolled were characterized for cancer family history. A subgroup of 48 women were classified for the presence of a BRCA mutation. PBL-TL were summarized as means and standard deviations, and compared by standard analysis of variance.

The telomere length is shorter in cases than in controls after adjusting for age. No effect on PBL-TL of BMI, smoke nor of the most common risk factors for breast cancer was observed. No association between PBL-TL and family history was detected both in BC cases and controls. In the multivariate model, no association was observed between BRCA mutation and decreased PBL-TL.

Background &lt;p&gt;Telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL-TL) was proposed as a biomarker of cancer risk. Recent scientific evidence suggested PBL-TL plays a diverse role in different cancers. Inconsistent results were obtained on PBL-TL in relation to breast cancer risk and specifically to the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The aim of the present case-control study was to analyse the correlation between family history of breast cancer or presence of a BRCA mutation and PBL-TL in the hypothesis that TL is a modifier of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;PBL-TL was measured using the real-time quantitative PCR method in DNA for 142 cases and 239 controls. All the women enrolled were characterized for cancer family history. A subgroup of 48 women were classified for the presence of a BRCA mutation. PBL-TL were summarized as means and standard deviations, and compared by standard analysis of variance. A multivariable Generalised Linear Model was fitted to the data with PBL-TL as the dependent variable, case/control status and presence of a BRCA/VUS mutation as factors, and age in 4 strata as a covariate.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Age was significantly associated with decreasing PBL-TL in controls (p = 0.01), but not in BC cases. The telomere length is shorter in cases than in controls after adjusting for age. No effect on PBL-TL of BMI, smoke nor of the most common risk factors for breast cancer was observed. No association between PBL-TL and family history was detected both in BC cases and controls. In the multivariate model, no association was observed between BRCA mutation and decreased PBL-TL. A statistically significant interaction (p = 0.031) between case-control status and a BRCA-mutation/VUS was observed, but no effect was detected for the interaction of cancer status and BRCA or VUS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study fails to provide support to the hypothesis that PBL-TL is associated with the risk of hereditary BC, or that is a marker of inherited mutations in BRCA genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><title>Leucocytes telomere length and breast cancer risk/ susceptibility: A case-control study</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197522</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197522</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122d:93d646dc</id><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b12836</originId><fingerprint>fc4aa330</fingerprint><author><name>Aditi Sharma, Sven H.

Study objectives &lt;p&gt;In order to increase the value of randomized response techniques (RRTs) as tools for studying sensitive issues, the present study investigated whether the prevalence estimate for a sensitive item π^s assessed with the unrelated questionnaire method (UQM) is influenced by changing the probability of receiving the sensitive question &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;A short paper-and-pencil questionnaire was distributed to 1.243 university students assessing the 12-month prevalence of physical and cognitive doping using two versions of the UQM with different probabilities for receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3). Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess whether the prevalence estimates for physical and cognitive doping differed significantly between &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3. The order of questions (physical doping and cognitive doping) as well as the probability of receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3) were counterbalanced across participants.

Study objectives &lt;p&gt;In order to increase the value of randomized response techniques (RRTs) as tools for studying sensitive issues, the present study investigated whether the prevalence estimate for a sensitive item π^s assessed with the unrelated questionnaire method (UQM) is influenced by changing the probability of receiving the sensitive question &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;A short paper-and-pencil questionnaire was distributed to 1.243 university students assessing the 12-month prevalence of physical and cognitive doping using two versions of the UQM with different probabilities for receiving the sensitive question (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 1/3 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≈ 2/3).

We developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism’s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HxEjp5eCvBA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gonçalo M.

Despite its potential, MSS still needs to be greatly advanced, which requires currently lacking tools for quantitative characterization of streams in MSS. We developed and introduce here an analytical toolbox for this task. The first tool is a method to convolute 3D raw MSS data into a 2D “angulagram” via signal integration over the whole separation zone using a polar coordinate system.

Despite its potential, MSS still needs to be greatly advanced, which requires currently lacking tools for quantitative characterization of streams in MSS. We developed and introduce here an analytical toolbox for this task. The first tool is a method to convolute 3D raw MSS data into a 2D “angulagram” via signal integration over the whole separation zone using a polar coordinate system. The second tool is three quantitative parameters characterizing stream width, linearity, and deflection, which are determined from an angulagram. The third tool is the analysis of the three parameters in relation to physicochemical characteristics of MSS which reveals deficiencies and guides improvements in MSS devices and methods. Examples of toolbox application to validation of previously published MSS data are provided.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>2</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Quantitative_Characterization_of_Molecular-Stream_Separation/6279296</link><crawled>1526564254751</crawled><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1636e51f41f:4861309:3dd877af</id><published>1526515200000</published><title>Quantitative Characterization of Molecular-Stream Separation</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04977-6</originId><fingerprint>626b9df5</fingerprint><author><name>Brian  Krumm</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04977-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activation mechanisms for a universal signalling protein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activation mechanisms for a universal signalling protein, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04977-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04977-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Computational and biochemical studies have revealed the mechanisms by which arrestin proteins are activated by G-protein-coupled receptors — potentially opening up broad avenues for drug discovery.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activation mechanisms for a universal signalling protein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activation mechanisms for a universal signalling protein, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04977-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04977-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Computational and biochemical studies have revealed the mechanisms by which arrestin proteins are activated by G-protein-coupled receptors — potentially opening up broad avenues for drug discovery.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>64</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04977-6</link><crawled>1525281531008</crawled><visual><height>450</height><width>800</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04977-6/d41586-018-04977-6_15728036.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16321dd2480:6351bb:5785ab88</id><published>1525244400000</published><title>Activation mechanisms for a universal signalling protein</title></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196934</originId><fingerprint>7cf27efe</fingerprint><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196934</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196934</canonicalUrl><unread>False</unread><title>Correction: Characterizing the metabolic phenotype of intestinal villus blunting in Zambian children with severe acute malnutrition and persistent diarrhea</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196934</link><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a79:11c251fd</id><published>1525208400000</published><updated>1525208400000</updated></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;by Khan Rubayet Rahaman, Quazi K.

The 3D organization of chromosomes is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Many experimental and polymer modeling efforts are dedicated to deciphering the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding. Chromosomes are long and densely packed—topologically constrained—polymers. The main challenges are therefore to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate properly the multi spatio-temporal scales of such macromolecules. Here, we develop a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Accounting accurately for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density, we show that our simulation scheme not only captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system but also tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining. This strategy allows a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and to go beyond the current limitations by studying long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. We use our formalism to investigate in details the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YYb8ENLLah4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Surya K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an important biomarker for patients with cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. It is also known that BNP levels are relatively higher in patients with chronic kidney disease and no heart disease; however, the mechanism remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We developed a BNP reporter mouse and occasionally found that this promoter was activated specifically in the papillary tip of the kidneys, and its activation was not accompanied by &lt;i&gt;BNP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression. No evidence was found to support the existence of BNP isoforms or other nucleotide expression apart from BNP and tdTomato. The pBNP-tdTomato-positive cells were interstitial cells and were not proliferative. Unexpectedly, both the expression and secretion of BNP increased in primary cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes after their treatment with an extract of the renal papillary tip. Intraperitoneal injection of the extract of the papillary tips reduced blood pressure from 210 mmHg to 165 mmHg, the decrease being accompanied by an increase in serum BNP and urinary cGMP production in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP) rats. Furthermore the induction of BNP by the papillary extract from rats with heart failure due to myocardial infarction was increased in cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggested that the papillary tip express a substance that can stimulate BNP production and secretion from cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Itaru Goto, Ryuji Okamoto, Ryotaro Hashizume, Noboru Suzuki, Rie Ito, Keiichi Yamanaka, Hiromitsu Saito, Hiroshi Kiyonari, Isao Tawara, Yuki Kageyama, Yoshito Ogihara, Yusuf Ali, Norikazu Yamada, Naoyuki Katayama, Masaaki Ito&lt;/p&gt;

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) transplant has been reported to be a potential treatment for burn wounds. However, the effects of autogenicity and allogenicity of ADSCs on burn wound healing have not been investigated and the method for using ADSCs still needs to be established. This study compared the healing effects of autologous and allogenic ADSCs and determined an optimal method of using ADSCs to treat acute burn wounds. Experiments were performed in 20 male Wistar rats (weight, 176–250 g; age, 6–7 weeks). Two identical full-thickness burn wounds (radius, 4 mm) were created in each rat. ADSCs harvested from inguinal area and characterized by their high multipotency were injected into burn wounds in the original donor rats (autologous ADSCs group) or in other rats (allogenic ADSCs group). The injection site was either the wound center or the four corners 0.5 cm from the wound edge. The reduction of burn surface areas in the two experimental groups and in control group were evaluated with Image J software for 15 days post-wounding to determine the wound healing rates. Wound healing was significantly faster in the autologous ADSCs group compared to both the allogenic ADSCs group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;) and control group (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). Wound healing in the allogenic ADSC group did not significantly differ from that in control group. Notably, ADSC injections 0.5cm from the wound edge showed significantly improved healing compared to ADSCs injections in the wound center (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;05&lt;/i&gt;). This study demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of ADSCs in treating acute burn wounds in rats. However, only autologous ADSCs improved healing in acute burn wounds; allogenic ADSCs did not. This study further determined a superior location of using ADSCs injections to treat burn wounds including the injection site. Future studies will replicate the experiment in a larger and long-term scale burn wounds in higher mammalian models to facilitate ADSCs therapy in burn wound clinical practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Wei Chang, Yi-Chia Wu, Shu-Hung Huang, Hui-Min David Wang, Yur-Ren Kuo, Su-Shin Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Advanced graphics capabilities have enabled the use of virtual reality as an efficient design technique. The integration of virtual reality in the design phase still faces impediment because of issues linked to the integration of CAD and virtual reality software. A set of empirical tests using the selected conversion parameters was found to yield properly represented virtual reality models. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 72.71% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 86.64%, indicating that 86.64% of the response variability can be explained by the model. The R-sq (pred) is 67.45%, which is not very high, indicating that the model should be further reduced by eliminating insignificant terms. The reduced model yields an R-sq (pred) value of 73.32% and an R-sq (adjusted) value of 79.49%, indicating that 79.49% of the response variability can be explained by the model. Using the optimization software MODE Frontier (Optimization, MOGA-II, 2014), four types of response surfaces for the three considered response variables were tested for the data of DOE. The parameter values obtained using the proposed experimental design methodology result in better graphics quality, and other necessary design attributes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mustufa Haider Abidi, Abdulrahman Al-Ahmari, Ali Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

Inflammation causes nociceptive sensory neuron activation, evoking debilitating symptoms and reflexes. Inflammatory signaling pathways are capable of modulating mitochondrial function, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization and calcium release. Previously we showed that mitochondrial modulation with antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, selectively stimulated nociceptive bronchopulmonary C-fibers via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1) cation channels. TRPA1 is ROS-sensitive, but there is little evidence that TRPV1 is activated by ROS. Here, we used dual imaging of dissociated vagal neurons to investigate the correlation of mitochondrial superoxide production (mitoSOX) or mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1) with cytosolic calcium (Fura-2AM), following mitochondrial modulation by antimycin A, rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, mitochondrial uncoupling agent). Mitochondrial modulation by all agents selectively increased cytosolic calcium in a subset of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing (A1/V1+) neurons. There was a significant correlation between antimycin A-induced calcium responses and mitochondrial superoxide in wild-type ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons, which was eliminated in TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons.

Inflammation causes nociceptive sensory neuron activation, evoking debilitating symptoms and reflexes. Inflammatory signaling pathways are capable of modulating mitochondrial function, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization and calcium release. Previously we showed that mitochondrial modulation with antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, selectively stimulated nociceptive bronchopulmonary C-fibers via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1) cation channels. TRPA1 is ROS-sensitive, but there is little evidence that TRPV1 is activated by ROS. Here, we used dual imaging of dissociated vagal neurons to investigate the correlation of mitochondrial superoxide production (mitoSOX) or mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1) with cytosolic calcium (Fura-2AM), following mitochondrial modulation by antimycin A, rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, mitochondrial uncoupling agent). Mitochondrial modulation by all agents selectively increased cytosolic calcium in a subset of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing (A1/V1+) neurons. There was a significant correlation between antimycin A-induced calcium responses and mitochondrial superoxide in wild-type ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons, which was eliminated in TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nevertheless, antimycin A-induced superoxide production did not always increase calcium in A1/V1+ neurons, suggesting a critical role of an unknown factor. CCCP caused both superoxide production and mitochondrial depolarization but neither correlated with calcium fluxes in A1/V1+ neurons. Rotenone-induced calcium responses in ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons correlated with mitochondrial depolarization but not superoxide production. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction causes calcium fluxes in a subset of A1/V1+ neurons via ROS-dependent and ROS-independent mechanisms.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Mitochondrial modulation-induced activation of vagal sensory neuronal subsets by antimycin A, but not CCCP or rotenone, correlates with mitochondrial superoxide production</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</link><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4226b:5785ab88</id><published>1525726800000</published><updated>1525726800000</updated></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196687</originId><fingerprint>dbd1ac1f</fingerprint><author><name>Yi-Ming Weng</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196687</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yi-Ming Weng, Chip-Jin Ng, Chen-June Seak, Cheng-Yu Chien, Kuan-Fu Chen, Jr-Rung Lin, Chee-Jen Chang&lt;/p&gt;
Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest. Socioeconomic status and comorbidity were major confounders of costs. The outcome measures of cardiac arrest should extend beyond the death, and encompass destitution.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adults. People with OSAS have a higher risk of experiencing traffic accidents and occupational injuries (OIs). We aimed to clarify the diagnostic performance of a three-channel screening device (ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with the gold standard of full-night attended polysomnography (PSG) among hospital outpatients not referred for sleep-related symptoms. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether manual revision of the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore enhanced diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We investigated 68 patients with OI and 44 without OI recruited from the University Hospital Basel emergency room, using a cross-sectional study design. Participating patients spent one night at home with ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and within 2 weeks slept for one night at the sleep laboratory. We reanalyzed all ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; data after manual revision.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified significant correlations between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) autoscore and the AHI derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.525; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) autoscore and that derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.722; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore showed a sensitivity and specificity of 82% when comparing AHI ≥5 with the cutoff for AHI and/or ODI ≥15 from PSG.

Background &lt;p&gt;Increased hepatic insulin clearance (HIC) is important in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study is to analyze an effective insulin resistance (IR) index that is minimally affected by HIC.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Our study involved 20 participants with T2DM and 21 healthy participants without diabetes (Non-DM). Participants underwent a meal tolerance test from which plasma glucose, insulin and serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) were measured, and HOMA-IR and HIC were calculated. Participants then underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp from which the glucose disposal rate (GDR) was measured.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The index CPR-IR = 20/(fasting CPR × fasting plasma glucose) was correlated more strongly with GDR, than was HOMA-IR, and CPR-IR could be used to estimate GDR.

This study describes differences in species richness and composition of the assemblages of galling insects and their host plants at different spatial scales. Sampling was conducted along altitudinal gradients composed of &lt;i&gt;campos rupestres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;campos de altitude&lt;/i&gt; of two mountain complexes in southeastern Brazil: Espinhaço Range and Mantiqueira Range. The following hypotheses were tested: i) local and regional richness of host plants and galling insects are positively correlated; ii) beta diversity is the most important component of regional diversity of host plants and galling insects; and iii) Turnover is the main mechanism driving beta diversity of both host plants and galling insects. Local richness of galling insects and host plants increased with increasing regional richness of species, suggesting a pattern of unsaturated communities. The additive partition of regional richness (γ) into local and beta components shows that local richnesses (α) of species of galling insects and host plants are low relative to regional richness; the beta (β) component incorporates most of the regional richness. The multi-scale analysis of additive partitioning showed similar patterns for galling insects and host plants with the local component (α) incorporated a small part of regional richness. Beta diversity of galling insects and host plants were mainly the result of turnover, with little contribution from nesting. Although the species composition of galling insects and host plant species varied among sample sites, mountains and even mountain ranges, local richness remained relatively low. In this way, the addition of local habitats with different landscapes substantially affects regional richness. Each mountain contributes fundamentally to the composition of regional diversity of galling insects and host plants, and so the design of future conservation strategies should incorporate multiple scales.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marcel Serra Coelho, Marco Antônio Alves Carneiro, Cristina Alves Branco, Rafael Augusto Xavier Borges, Geraldo Wilson Fernandes&lt;/p&gt;

Current therapeutics for hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients such as nucleoside analogs (NAs) are effective; however, new antiviral drugs against HBV are still desired. Since the interaction between the epsilon (ε) sequence of HBV pregenomic RNA and viral polymerase (Pol) is a key step in the HBV replication cycle, we aimed to identify small compounds for its inhibition, and established a pull-down assay system for the detection of ε-RNA-binding-Pol. Screening showed that 5 out of 3,965 compounds inhibited ε-Pol binding, and we identified rosmarinic acid, which exhibited specificity, as a potential antiviral agent. In order to examine the anti-HBV effects of rosmarinic acid, HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes from a humanized mouse liver were treated with rosmarinic acid. The rosmarinic acid treatment decreased HBV components including the amounts of extracellular HBV DNA with negligible cytotoxicity. We also investigated the combined effects of rosmarinic acid and the NA, lamivudine. rosmarinic acid slightly enhanced the anti-HBV activity of lamivudine, suggesting that the HBV replication step targeted by rosmarinic acid is distinct from that of NA. We analyzed an additional 25 rosmarinic acid derivatives, and found that 5 also inhibited ε-Pol. Structural comparisons between these derivatives implied that the “two phenolic hydroxyl groups at both ends” and the “caffeic acid-like structure” of rosmarinic acid are critical for the inhibition of ε-Pol binding. Collectively, our results demonstrate that rosmarinic acid inhibits HBV replication in HBV-infected cells by specifically targeting ε-Pol binding.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuta Tsukamoto, Sotaro Ikeda, Koji Uwai, Riho Taguchi, Kazuaki Chayama, Takemasa Sakaguchi, Ryo Narita, Wan-Ling Yao, Fumihiko Takeuchi, Yukie Otakaki, Koichi Watashi, Takaji Wakita, Hiroki Kato, Takashi Fujita&lt;/p&gt;

Mitotane is the reference drug for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and the metabolic activation of the drug is considered as essential for its activity. The aim of this study was to assess the role of CYP11B1 on mitotane action and metabolism in H295R ACC cells to understand whether this enzyme may influence mitotane action. The simultaneous incubation with mitotane and metyrapone, an adrenolytic molecule targeting 11-beta-hydroxylase, did not influence mitotane-mediated cytotoxic effect and metabolism in H295R ACC cells. CYP11B1 silencing confirmed the lack of a significant metyrapone effect on mitotane action. The present findings do not support the view that CYP11B1 catalyzes a crucial step in the metabolic activation of mitotane and that CYP11B1 confers the adrenal specificity to mitotane.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonina Germano, Laura Saba, Silvia De Francia, Ida Rapa, Paola Perotti, Alfredo Berruti, Marco Volante, Massimo Terzolo&lt;/p&gt;

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular method for measuring transcript abundance. The most commonly used method of interpretation is relative quantification and thus necessitates the use of normalization controls (i.e. reference genes) to standardize transcript abundance. The most popular gene targets for RT-qPCR are housekeeping genes because they are thought to maintain a static transcript level among a variety of samples. However, more recent studies have shown, several housekeeping genes are not reliably stable. This is the first study to examine the potential of several reference genes for use in RT-qPCR normalization during barley malting. The process of malting barley mechanizes the imbibition and subsequent germination of barley seeds under controlled conditions. Malt quality is controlled by many pleiotropic genes that are determined by examining the result of physiological changes the barley seed undergoes during the malting process. We compared the stability of 13 reference genes across both two-and six-row malting barleys (Conrad and Legacy, respectfully) throughout the entirety of the malting process. Initially, primer target specificity, amplification efficiency and average Ct values were determined for each of the selected primer pairs. Three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to rank the stability of each reference gene. Rankings were similar between the two- and six-row with the exception of BestKeeper’s ranking of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;). A consensus ranking among programs was determined using RefFinder. Our results show that Actin (A&lt;i&gt;CT&lt;/i&gt;) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (&lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) were the most stable throughout micromalting, while &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and Cyclophilin (&lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) were the least stable. Two reference genes are necessary for stable transcript normalization according to geNorm and the best two reference genes (&lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) provided a sufficient level of stability.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jason G.

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

The Morris water maze test (MWM) is a useful tool to evaluate rodents’ spatial learning and memory, but the outcome is susceptible to various experimental conditions. Thigmotaxis is a commonly observed behavioral pattern which is thought to be related to anxiety or fear. This behavior is associated with prolonged escape latency, but the impact of its frequency in the early stage on the final outcome is not clearly understood. We analyzed swim path trajectories in male C57BL/6 mice with or without bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis. As the next step, we made a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize the swim path trajectories. Our model could distinguish thigmotaxis from other trajectories with 96% accuracy and specificity as high as 0.98. These results suggest that thigmotaxis in the early training stage is a predictive factor for impaired performance in MWM, and machine learning can detect such behavior easily and automatically.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akinori Higaki, Masaki Mogi, Jun Iwanami, Li-Juan Min, Hui-Yu Bai, Bao-Shuai Shan, Harumi Kan-no, Shuntaro Ikeda, Jitsuo Higaki, Masatsugu Horiuchi&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to examine eye movements and postural control performance among dyslexic children while reading a text and performing the Landolt reading task. Fifteen dyslexic and 15 non-dyslexic children were asked to stand upright while performing two experimental visual tasks: text reading and Landolt reading. In the text reading task, children were asked to silently read a text displayed on a monitor, while in the Landolt reading task, the letters in the text were replaced by closed circles and Landolt rings, and children were asked to scan each circle/ring in a reading-like fashion, from left to right, and to count the number of Landolt rings. Eye movements (Mobile T2&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SuriCog) and center of pressure excursions (Framiral&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, Grasse, France) were recorded. Visual performance variables were total reading time, mean duration of fixation, number of pro- and retro-saccades, and amplitude of pro-saccades. Postural performance variable was the center of pressure area. The results showed that dyslexic children spent more time reading the text and had a longer duration of fixation than non-dyslexic children. However, no difference was observed between dyslexic and non-dyslexic children in the Landolt reading task. Dyslexic children performed a higher number of pro- and retro-saccades than non-dyslexic children in both text reading and Landolt reading tasks. Dyslexic children had smaller pro-saccade amplitude than non-dyslexic children in the text reading task. Finally, postural performance was poorer in dyslexic children than in non-dyslexic children. Reading difficulties in dyslexic children are related to eye movement strategies required to scan and obtain lexical and semantic meaning. However, postural control performance, which was poor in dyslexic children, is not related to lexical and semantic reading requirements and might not also be related to different eye movement behavior.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Milena Razuk, José Angelo Barela, Hugo Peyre, Christophe Loic Gerard, Maria Pia Bucci&lt;/p&gt;

Cells switch between quiescence and proliferation states for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regeneration. At the restriction point (R-point), cells become irreversibly committed to the completion of the cell cycle independent of mitogen. The mechanism involving hyper-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and activation of transcription factor E2F is linked to the R-point passage. However, stress stimuli trigger exit from the cell cycle back to the mitogen-sensitive quiescent state after Rb hyper-phosphorylation but only until APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; inactivation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to investigate the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation in mammalian cells with respect to mitogen and stress signals. The model integrates the current mechanistic knowledge and accounts for the recent experimental observations with cells exiting quiescence and proliferating cells. We show that Cyclin E:Cdk2 couples Rb-E2F and APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable switches and temporally segregates the R-point and the G1/S transition. A redox-dependent mutual antagonism between APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; and its inhibitor Emi1 makes the inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable. We show that the levels of Cdk inhibitor (CKI) and mitogen control the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation. Further, we propose that shifting of the mitogen-induced transcriptional program to G2-phase in proliferating cells might result in an intermediate Cdk2 activity at the mitotic exit and in the immediate inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our study builds a coherent framework and generates hypotheses that can be further explored by experiments.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nishtha Pandey, P. K.

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Advanced liver fibrosis is an important predictor of liver disease progression and mortality, and current guidelines recommend screening for complications of cirrhosis once patients develop F3 fibrosis. Our study compared liver disease progression and survival in patients with stage 3 (F3) and stage 4 (F4) fibrosis on liver biopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study of patients with F3 or F4 on liver biopsy followed for development of liver disease complications (variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy); hepatocellular carcinoma, and survival (overall and transplant free survival).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2488 patients receiving liver biopsy between 01/02 and 12/12, a total of 294 (171 F3) were analyzed. Over a median follow up period of 3 years, patients with F4 (mean age 53 years, 63% male) compared to F3 (mean age 49 years, 43% male) had higher five year cumulative probability of any decompensation (38% vs. 14%, p&amp;lt;0.0001), including variceal bleed (10% vs. 4%, p = 0.014), ascites (21% vs. 9%, p = 0.0014), and hepatic encephalopathy (14% vs. 5%, p = 0.003).

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Advanced liver fibrosis is an important predictor of liver disease progression and mortality, and current guidelines recommend screening for complications of cirrhosis once patients develop F3 fibrosis. Our study compared liver disease progression and survival in patients with stage 3 (F3) and stage 4 (F4) fibrosis on liver biopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study of patients with F3 or F4 on liver biopsy followed for development of liver disease complications (variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy); hepatocellular carcinoma, and survival (overall and transplant free survival).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2488 patients receiving liver biopsy between 01/02 and 12/12, a total of 294 (171 F3) were analyzed. Over a median follow up period of 3 years, patients with F4 (mean age 53 years, 63% male) compared to F3 (mean age 49 years, 43% male) had higher five year cumulative probability of any decompensation (38% vs. 14%, p&amp;lt;0.0001), including variceal bleed (10% vs. 4%, p = 0.014), ascites (21% vs. 9%, p = 0.0014), and hepatic encephalopathy (14% vs. 5%, p = 0.003). F4 patients also had lower overall 5-year survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.003) and transplant free survival (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.002). Probability of hepatocellular carcinoma in 5 years after biopsy was similar between F3 and F4 (1.2% vs. 2%, p = 0.54).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Compared to F4 stage, patients with F3 fibrosis have decreased risk for development of liver disease complications and better survival.

Adult height is determined by both genetic characteristics and environmental factors in early life. Although previous studies have suggested that adult height is associated with risk of mortality, comprehensive associations between height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Japanese population are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the associations between adult height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among Japanese men and women in a prospective cohort study. We investigated 107,794 participants (50,755 men and 57,039 women) aged 40 to 69 years who responded to the baseline questionnaire in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Participants were classified by quartile of adult height obtained from a self-reported questionnaire in men (&amp;lt;160cm, 160-163cm, 164-167cm, ≥168cm) and women (&amp;lt;149cm, 149-151cm, 152-155cm, ≥156cm). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality from all-cause, cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other cause mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 12,320 men and 7,030 women died. Taller adult height was associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.69–0.99); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.90–0.99)) and respiratory disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.69–1.03); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.87–0.97)), but was also associated with increased risk for overall cancer mortality (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.17 (1.07–1.28); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.04 (1.01–1.07)) in men. Taller adult height was also associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;149cm vs. ≥156cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.66–1.05); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.86–0.99)) in women.

Consumption of different PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) can induce functional changes in blood vessels via endothelial cells, which interact with dietary factors in the circulation. The basement membrane that separates the endothelium from the smooth muscle cells of the medial layer can also influence the functional state of endothelial cells. However, the effect of basement membrane on the endothelial response to dietary PUFAs in relation to growth state (e.g. proliferation versus quiescence) has never been investigated. We therefore compared the viability (CCK kit) and proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) of EA.hy926 endothelial cells grown on Matrigel or collagen versus non-coated plates. EA.hy926 viability and proliferation were also assessed after treatment with 0–150 μM of PUFAs [linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. Our study showed that only cells grown on Matrigel-coated plates reached quiescence after becoming confluent with a decreased level of MCM2 and p-cyclin D1 (T286), increased levels of p27kip1 and a low level of apoptosis and senescence. AA, EPA and DHA decreased the viability and proliferation of subconfluent cells grown on plastic dishes in a dose-dependent manner, while the presence of Matrigel made the cells resistant to these adverse effects. Confluent cell viability was less sensitive to higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA than subconfluent cells, and a significant increase in caspase-3 cleavage was only observed in confluent cells treated with DHA. Higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA suppressed DNA synthesis by both subconfluent and confluent cells, while precursor C18 PUFAs (LA and ALA) had no negative effects on viability and proliferation. Our study is the first to show that extracellular matrix and growth state are important factors in the EA.hy926 cell response to PUFAs, and that the mechanisms by which individual PUFAs operate may be growth state-dependent.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youjia Du, Carla G.

Urban economies are composed of diverse activities, embodied in labor occupations, which depend on one another to produce goods and services. Yet little is known about how the nature and intensity of these interdependences change as cities increase in population size and economic complexity. Understanding the relationship between occupational interdependencies and the number of occupations defining an urban economy is relevant because interdependence within a networked system has implications for system resilience and for how easily can the structure of the network be modified. Here, we represent the interdependencies among occupations in a city as a non-spatial information network, where the strengths of interdependence between pairs of occupations determine the strengths of the links in the network. Using those quantified link strengths we calculate a single metric of interdependence–or connectedness–which is equivalent to the density of a city’s weighted occupational network. We then examine urban systems in six industrialized countries, analyzing how the density of urban occupational networks changes with network size, measured as the number of unique occupations present in an urban workforce. We find that in all six countries, density, or economic interdependence, increases superlinearly with the number of distinct occupations. Because connections among occupations represent flows of information, we provide evidence that connectivity scales superlinearly with network size in information networks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shade T.

Aim &lt;p&gt;To determine choroidal thickness in healthy Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study; healthy Indian subjects (n = 230) with no history of ocular and/or systemic disorders were enrolled in the study. Choroidal thickness was measured for 230 eyes using SS-OCT. Subjects were divided into six age groups. Main outcome measures were subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular choroidal thickness (MCT) up to 3 mm at 500-micron interval from the fovea was measured in eight different quadrants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean SFCT was 307±79 μm and mean MCT was 285±75 μm. No difference in the choroidal thickness was found among genders. Mean SFCT of the different age groups was 327±68 μm (12–18 years), 364±70 μm (18.1–30 years), 321±78 μm (30.1–40 years), 304±79 μm (40.1–50 years), 283±69 μm (50.1–60 years) and 262±72μm (above 60 years; p &amp;lt;0.001; One way ANOVA). Mean macular choroidal thickness was 305±60 μm, 342±61 μm, 306±72 μm, 282±79 μm, 261±66 μm, 238±68μm respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001; one way ANOVA). A significant weak negative correlation was found between age with SFCT (r = -0.368, p&amp;lt;0.001) and MCT (r = -0.40, p&amp;lt;0.001). No significant correlation was found with refractive error, axial length and ocular perfusion pressure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that mean SFCT and MCT was 307±79μm and 285±75 μm, respectively, among healthy Indian subjects.

Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in &lt;i&gt;PIK3CA&lt;/i&gt; genes. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zixing Wang, Kwok-Shing Ng, Tenghui Chen, Tae-Beom Kim, Fang Wang, Kenna Shaw, Kenneth L.

Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Cancer driver mutation prediction through Bayesian integration of multi-omic data</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475057:2835af05</id><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-d?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>f95e79e3</fingerprint><author><name>Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, J.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-d?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-d?rss=1</link><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.4.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7cc:93d646dc</id><published>1525974002000</published><title>Early warning about emerging contaminants</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197849</originId><fingerprint>7d9b7cd3</fingerprint><author><name>Rolf Grempler</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197849</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rolf Grempler, Michael Wolff, Eric Simon, Ramona Schmid, Claudia Eisele, Kathrin Rieber, Elke Fischer, Sonja Mettel, Ogsen Gabrielyan, Denis Delic, Gerd Luippold, Norbert Redeman&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an attractive approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. AMPK activation reduces glucose levels in animal models of type 2 diabetes by increasing glucose uptake in skeletal muscles and reducing hepatic glucose production. Furthermore, AMPK activation ameliorates hepatic steatosis in animal models. For the clinical development of AMPK activators it is essential to have a reliable target engagement marker for appropriate dose finding and to support proof of clinical principle. While the activation of AMPK by quantification of the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; in target tissues can be assessed pre-clinically, this is not feasible in clinical studies. Therefore, we attempted to identify and translate a peripheral target engagement biomarker downstream of AMPK activation for clinical use in blood samples.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;For pharmacological activation of AMPK, two AMPK activators were synthesized (compound 1 and 2). A compound with structural similarities but no pharmacological effect on AMPK phosphorylation was synthesized as negative control (compound 3). Whole blood from healthy volunteers was incubated with an AMPK activator for up to 6 hours and mRNA sequencing was performed. Additionally, human PBMCs were isolated to evaluate Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in Western blots. In order to enable identification of translatable biomarker candidates, blood samples from HanWistar rats treated for two weeks with an AMPK activator were also subjected to mRNA sequencing. Furthermore, concentration-response curves for four biomarker candidates were recorded in human blood samples using Nanostring nCounter technology. Finally, ZDF rats were treated with increasing doses of compound 2 for five weeks to investigate the glucose-lowering efficacy. To investigate changes of mRNA expression of two selected biomarker candidates in this ZDF rat study, qRT-PCR was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Pharmacological activation of AMPK in human PBMCs revealed an increase in Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK, confirming target engagement in these blood cells. RNA sequencing of human blood samples identified 608 deregulated genes after AMPK activation. Additionally, AMPK activation led to deregulation of 367 genes in whole blood from HanWistar rats which mapped to the respective human genes. 22 genes out of the intersection of genes deregulated in both species are proposed as potential translatable target engagement biomarker candidates. The most prominent genes were transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB, osteoactivin), calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGLYRP1) and Ras homolog gene family, member B (RHOB). Specificity for AMPK was shown by testing inactive compound 3 in HanWistar rats. The exposure-effect relationship for GPNMB was investigated in a subchronic study in diabetic ZDF rats. GPNMB showed a dose-dependent up-regulation both acutely and after subchronic dosing. GPNMB up-regulation correlated with an increased Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in liver and quadriceps muscle in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;GPNMB has been identified as a translatable target engagement biomarker for use in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rolf Grempler, Michael Wolff, Eric Simon, Ramona Schmid, Claudia Eisele, Kathrin Rieber, Elke Fischer, Sonja Mettel, Ogsen Gabrielyan, Denis Delic, Gerd Luippold, Norbert Redeman&lt;/p&gt;

Accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a significant role in obesity, insulin resistance and associated liver disorders. Family &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and especially &lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&lt;/i&gt; strain B29 have been previously linked to obesity and hepatic damage. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Therefore, we comprehensively examined the effects of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC® 13047™) administration on host metabolism of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6N mice were randomly divided into HFD control, chow control, and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment groups. The &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment group received live bacterial cells in PBS intragastrically twice a week, every other week for 13 weeks. Both control groups received PBS intragastrically. After the 13-week treatment period, the mice were sacrificed for gene and protein expression and functional analyses. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; administration increased subcutaneous fat mass and the relative proportion of hypertrophic adipocytes. Both subcutaneous and visceral fat had signs of decreased insulin signaling and elevated lipolysis that was reflected in higher serum glycerol levels.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Pathological response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) represents a commonly used predictor of survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the need to identify markers that predict response to NAC is constantly increasing. Aim of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of PET imaging with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FLT for the discrimination of TNBC responders to Paclitaxel (PTX) therapy compared to the response assessed by an adapted Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria based on tumor volume (Tumor Volume Response).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Nu/nu mice bearing TNBC lesions of different size were evaluated with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FLT PET before and after PTX treatment.

Response evaluation using Tumor Volume Response (TVR) showed that the effectiveness of NAC with PTX was completely independent from lesions size at baseline.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study provided interesting results in terms of sensitivity and specificity of PET in TNBC, revealing the similar performances of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FLT in the identification of responders to Paclitaxel.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><title>[&amp;lt;sup&gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&amp;lt;sup&gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&gt;F]FLT PET for the evaluation of response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in a model of triple negative breast cancer</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197754</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197754</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2336:2835af05</id><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05164-3</originId><fingerprint>3516e364</fingerprint><author><name>Jee Loon Foo</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05164-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthetic yeast genome reveals its versatility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic yeast genome reveals its versatility, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05164-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05164-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A redesigned yeast genome is being constructed to allow it to be extensively rearranged on demand.

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b00931&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, you can do hydrogenation reactions in a stainless-steel ball mill, without any sort of noble-metal catalyst. The hydrogen is produced when you add some n-alkane or diethyl ether to the mix (these actually get converted to gaseous methane and hydrogen under the milling conditions). Some pretty severe reductions are realized, for example, taking biphenyl all the way down to 1-cyclohexylcyclohexane. Olefins go to alkanes under these conditions, of course, and ketones and alcohols tend to just get erased: it’s a bulldozer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although it’s surprising, this reaction isn’t quite as much voodoo as it might appear. Well, not more than any other hydrogenation, anyway. The ball mill is, of course, a sealed vessel, and the authors show that the lower-boiling additives seem to be more effective, presumably because they increase the internal pressure. And it’s not like there’s no catalyst present, because you have the stainless steel. If you use zirconium oxide balls instead of the steel alloy ones, for example, you get no hydrogenation at all. Adding bits of different metals back in showed that the chromium is what’s producing the hydrogen from the alkanes or ether, while the nickel is acting as the hydrogenation catalyst itself. The stainless-steel alloy itself (304 steel) was the most effective combination, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balls do get eroded a bit under the conditions, so what you’ve got is finely divided metals, under some heat from the mechanical energy of the milling, and under hydrogen pressure from the decomposition of the co-reactants. No wonder things get reduced! But it’s not a reaction that you would have predicted up front. And even if you’d stipulated that hydrogenation would start under these conditions, I don’t think you would have guessed how powerful it would be. The last time I hydrogenated down a whole aryl system (it’s been a while), I was running at something like 1600 psi (110 bar) at 120C with a rhodium catalyst, and the stuff came out looking – and smelling – like old lawnmower oil. This reaction probably doesn’t get above 60 degrees, by contrast. Admittedly, there’s no word in the paper about the appearance or aroma of the crude products, but I’m willing to bet that that part remains the same. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/09/hydrogenating-in-a-ball-mill</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13523</link><crawled>1525866557518</crawled><summary><content>Here’s one to add to the “weird mechanosynthesis” pile.

Treatment of prosthetic joint infections often involves multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic administration, resulting in a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system. We are exploring a non-invasive method to eradicate biofilm on metal implants utilizing high-frequency alternating magnetic fields (AMF) which can achieve surface induction heating. Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bingbing Cheng, Yonatan Chatzinoff, Debby Szczepanski, Chenchen Bing, Sumbul Shaikh, Omar Wyman, Cameron E.

LncRNAs are regulatory noncoding RNAs that play crucial roles in many biological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNA is thought to be involved in many complex diseases; lncRNAs are often the targets of miRNAs in the indirect regulation of gene expression. Numerous studies have indicated that miRNA-lncRNA interactions are closely related to the occurrence and development of cancers. Thus, it is important to develop an effective method for the identification of cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA interactions. In this study, we compiled 155653 experimentally validated and predicted miRNA-lncRNA associations, which we defined as basic interactions. We next constructed an individual-specific miRNA-lncRNA network (ISMLN) for each cancer sample and a basic miRNA-lncRNA network (BMLN) for each type of cancer by examining the expression profiles of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. We then selected potential miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers based on the BLMN. Using this method, we identified cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers and modules specific to a certain cancer. This method of profiling will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of cancers at the level of gene regulatory networks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guangle Zhang, Cong Pian, Zhi Chen, Jin Zhang, Mingmin Xu, Liangyun Zhang, Yuanyuan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion. Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert van Woesik, Christopher William Cacciapaglia&lt;/p&gt;

Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion. Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Keeping up with sea-level rise: Carbonate production rates in Palau and Yap, western Pacific Ocean</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506a:2835af05</id><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated></item><item><description>Drug interactions, including drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and drug–food constituent interactions (DFIs), can trigger unexpected pharmacological effects, including adverse drug events (ADEs), with causal mechanisms often unknown.

One of the most ambitious endeavors in the field of diabetes technology is non-invasive glucose sensing. In the past decades, a number of different technologies have been assessed, but none of these have found its entry into general clinical use. We report on the development of a table-top confocal Raman spectrometer that was used in the home of patients with diabetes and operated for extended periods of time unsupervised and without recalibration. The system is based on measurement of glucose levels at a ‘critical depth’ in the skin, specifically in the interstitial fluid located below the stratum corneum but above the underlying adipose tissue layer. The region chosen for routine glucose measurements was the base of the thumb (the thenar). In a small clinical study, 35 patients with diabetes analyzed their interstitial fluid glucose for a period of 60 days using the new critical-depth Raman (CD-Raman) method and levels were correlated to reference capillary blood glucose values using a standard finger-stick and test strip product. The calibration of the CD-Raman system was stable for &gt; 10 days. Measurement performance for glucose levels present at, or below, a depth of ~250μm below the skin surface was comparable to that reported for currently available invasive continuous glucose monitors. In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Signe M.

Over the last decades, the treatment of schizophrenia has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. In this study, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on social cognitive and nonsocial neurocognitive functions, as well as on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, in individuals with schizophrenia. Thirty-seven individuals with schizophrenia were administered one of three different tDCS conditions (cathodal, anodal, and sham) per visit over the course of three visits, with approximately one week between each visit. Order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. For the active conditions, the electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the reference electrode over right supraorbital cortex. Current intensity was 2 mA and was maintained for two 20-minute sessions, with a one hour break between the sessions. Assessments were conducted immediately following each session, in a counterbalanced order of administration. No systematic effects were found across the social and nonsocial cognitive domains, and no significant effects were detected on event-related potentials (ERPs). The very small effect sizes, further validated by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; power analyses (large Critical Ns), demonstrated that these findings were not due to lack of statistical power. Except for mild local discomfort, no significant side effects were reported. Findings demonstrate the safety and ease of administration of this procedure, but suggest that a single dose of tDCS over these areas does not yield a therapeutic effect on cognition in schizophrenia.

We find significant overlap of these networks with previously identified dysregulated gene expression modules identified in trisomy 21 fetal brain tissue. We show that harmine leads to partial normalization of key regulators of cortical development, including WNT7A and the transcription factors TBR1, BCL11A, and POU3F2, pointing to a causative role for DYRK1A over-expression in neurodevelopmental effects of human trisomy 21.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315317v2?rss=1</link><crawled>1525556242891</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/05/315317.1</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163323ce9cb:1e5db4b:93d646dc</id><published>1525503600000</published><title>Cerebral organoid proteomics reveals signatures of dysregulated cortical development associated with human trisomy 21 [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04643-5</originId><fingerprint>88779cf2</fingerprint><author><name>Wiebke Manuela Schulze</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/fCcKTsZ57Bo/s41467-018-04643-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Structural analysis of human ARS2 as a platform for co-transcriptional RNA sorting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Structural analysis of human ARS2 as a platform for co-transcriptional RNA sorting, Published online: 31 May 2018;

Brain stimulation can modulate the activity of neural circuits impaired by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), having promising clinical benefit. However, all individuals with the same condition currently receive identical brain stimulation, with limited theoretical basis for this generic approach. In this study, we introduce a control theory framework for obtaining exogenous signals that revert pathological electroencephalographic activity in AD at a minimal energetic cost, while reflecting patients’ biological variability. We used anatomical networks obtained from diffusion magnetic resonance images acquired by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as mediators for the interaction between Duffing oscillators. The nonlinear nature of the brain dynamics is preserved, given that we extend the so-called state-dependent Riccati equation control to reflect the stimulation objective in the high-dimensional neural system. By considering nonlinearities in our model, we identified regions for which control inputs fail to correct abnormal activity. There are changes to the way stimulated regions are ranked in terms of the energetic cost of controlling the entire network, from a linear to a nonlinear approach. We also found that limbic system and basal ganglia structures constitute the top target locations for stimulation in AD. Patients with highly integrated anatomical networks–namely, networks having low average shortest path length, high global efficiency–are the most suitable candidates for the propagation of stimuli and consequent success on the control task. Other diseases associated with alterations in brain dynamics and the self-control mechanisms of the brain can be addressed through our framework.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O4eVK9xR6I0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lazaro M.

Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic disorder characterized by an immune-mediated reaction to gluten and a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Currently, the main treatment of CD is represented by adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) which determines the resolution of symptoms, and the normalization of the serology and of the duodenal villous atrophy. In the present study, we aimed to identify changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of celiac patients on GFD for at least 2 years, in order to identify novel disease biomarkers and candidate targets for putative therapeutic approaches. Microarray analysis was performed on PBMCs from 17 celiac patients on long-term GFD and 20 healthy controls. We identified 517 annotated genes that were significantly modulated between celiac patients and controls. Significant biological pathways were functionally clustered using the Core Function of Ingenuity System Pathway Analysis (IPA). Intriguingly, despite being on a GFD, celiac patients exhibited a peculiar PBMC profile characterized by an aberrant expression of genes involved in the regulation of immunity, inflammatory response, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Random forest algorithm was then used to validate the prediction ability of core genes as classifiers of the “celiac status”. In conclusion, our study identified a characteristic PBMCs signature profile in clinically asymptomatic celiac patient.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Moris Sangineto, Giusi Graziano, Simona D’Amore, Roberto Salvia, Giuseppe Palasciano, Carlo Sabbà, Michele Vacca, Marica Cariello&lt;/p&gt;

We identified 517 annotated genes that were significantly modulated between celiac patients and controls. Significant biological pathways were functionally clustered using the Core Function of Ingenuity System Pathway Analysis (IPA). Intriguingly, despite being on a GFD, celiac patients exhibited a peculiar PBMC profile characterized by an aberrant expression of genes involved in the regulation of immunity, inflammatory response, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Random forest algorithm was then used to validate the prediction ability of core genes as classifiers of the “celiac status”. In conclusion, our study identified a characteristic PBMCs signature profile in clinically asymptomatic celiac patient.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Identification of peculiar gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of celiac patients on gluten free diet</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197915</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197915</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e22:2835af05</id><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197991</originId><fingerprint>82921d60</fingerprint><author><name>Se-Jun Park</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197991</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Se-Jun Park, Hong-Seok Lim, Seung-Soo Sheen, Hyoung-Mo Yang, Kyoung-Woo Seo, So-Yeon Choi, Byoung-Joo Choi, Myeong-Ho Yoon, Seung-Jea Tahk&lt;/p&gt;
Background and objective &lt;p&gt;The distribution of body fat is closely related to cardiovascular disease and outcomes, although its impact on patient prognosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) has not been evaluated. We investigated the impact of truncal fat distribution on long-term clinical outcomes after DES treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 441 DES-treated patients, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed to assess total and regional body fat distribution after index PCI. The ratio of truncal fat to total body fat mass (%FM&lt;sub&gt;trunk&lt;/sub&gt;/FM&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;) was calculated as a representative parameter for truncal fat distribution. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite of ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), non-procedural myocardial infarction, cardiac death at 5 years.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the median follow-up duration of 1780 days, MACE occurred in 22.0% of patients, with the highest-quartile group of %FM&lt;sub&gt;trunk&lt;/sub&gt;/FM&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; having a higher rate than the lowest quartile group (27.8% vs. 15.3%; log rank &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.026).

Oxygen is required for the completion of almost all known metazoan lifecycles, but many metazoans harbour abilities to withstand varying degrees and periods of hypoxia. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most popular model organism is extensively used as a model for the study of hypoxia and anoxia biology and it has been found that this nematode is capable of tolerance to varying degrees of hypoxia. Considering the extremely high diversity of nematodes, the effects of low oxygen concentration and mechanisms of adaptation to oxygen depletion differ among species. In this study, we used a simple assay to examine anoxia tolerance in four nematode species, including three free-living and one plant parasitic nematode. We found that the plant parasitic nematode &lt;i&gt;Bursaphelenchus xylophilus&lt;/i&gt; can survive more than 14 days under anoxic conditions. Comparisons of behaviour during anoxia induction and the repertoire of oxygen sensation genes among the tested species suggested the existence of different oxygen sensation systems between &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;xylophilus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;, which quickly introduce suspended animation in response to oxygen depletion to survive long-term anoxia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hiromi Kitazume, Mehmet Dayi, Ryusei Tanaka, Taisei Kikuchi&lt;/p&gt;

Self-measurement and documentation of blood-glucose are critical elements of diabetes management, particularly in regimes including insulin. In this study, we analyze the usability of iBG-STAR, the first blood glucose meter connectable to a smartphone. This technology records glucometer measurements, removing the burden of documentation from diabetic patients. This study assesses the potential for implementation of iBG-STAR in routine care. Twelve long-term diabetic patients (4 males; median age of 66.5 years) were enrolled in the study. N = 4/12 reported diabetic polyneuropathy. Reported subjective mental workload for all tasks related to iBG-STAR was on average lower than 12 points, corresponding to the verbal code ‘nearly no effort needed’. A “Post Study System Usability Questionnaire”, evaluated the glucometer at an average value of 2.06 (SD = 1.02) on a 7-Likert-scale (1 = ‘I fully agree’ to 7 = ‘I completely disagree’) for usability. These results represent a positive user-experience. Patients with polyneuropathy may experience physical difficulties in completing the tasks, thereby affecting usability. Technologically savvy patients (n = 6) with a positive outlook on diabetes assessed the product as a suitable tool for themselves and would recommend to other diabetic patients. The main barrier to regular use was treating physicians’ inability to retrieve digitally recorded data. This barrier was due to a shortcoming in interoperability of mobile devices and medical information systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Rasche, Alexander Mertens, Talya Miron-Shatz, Corinne Berzon, Christopher M.

Locomotor systems are widely used to study rhythmically active neural networks. These networks have to be coordinated in order to produce meaningful behavior. The crayfish swimmeret system is well suited to investigate such coordination of distributed neural oscillators because the neurons and their connectivity for generating and especially for coordinating the motor output are identified. The system maintains a fixed phase lag between the segmental oscillators, independent of cycle period. To further the understanding of the system’s plasticity for keeping the phase lag fixed, we profiled the neurotransmitters used by the Coordinating Neurons, which are necessary and sufficient for coordination of the segmental oscillators. We used a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and mass spectrometric methods. This arrangement of methods ensured that we could screen for several specific neurotransmitters, since a single method is often not suitable for all neurotransmitters of interest. In a first step, to preselect neurotransmitter candidates, we investigated the effect of substances known to be present in some swimmeret system neurons on the motor output and coordination. Subsequently, we demonstrated electrophysiologically that the identified synapse between the Coordinating Neurons and their target is mainly chemical, but neither glutamate antagonist nor γ-aminobutyric acid antagonist application affected this synapse. With immunohistochemical experiments, we provide strong evidence that the Coordinating Neurons are not serotonergic. Single-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with subsequent principal component analysis identified acetylcholine as the putative neurotransmitter for both types of Coordinating Neurons.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna C.

Single-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with subsequent principal component analysis identified acetylcholine as the putative neurotransmitter for both types of Coordinating Neurons.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Profiling neurotransmitters in a crustacean neural circuit for locomotion</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197781</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197781</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406a:2835af05</id><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03518</originId><fingerprint>b7695883</fingerprint><author><name>Satoshi Yamashita, Misao Mizuno, Duy Phuoc Tran, Hisham Dokainish, Akio Kitao, Yasuhisa Mizutani</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/aB5uij0bl4s/acs.jpcb.8b03518</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b03518/20180523/images/medium/jp-2018-035189_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03518&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

First discovered for their role in mediating programmed cell death and inflammatory responses, caspases have now emerged as crucial regulators of other cellular and physiological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. In the developing nervous system, for instance, the non-apoptotic functions of caspases have been shown to play critical roles in the formation of neuronal circuits by regulating axon outgrowth, guidance and pruning. How caspase activity is spatially and temporally maintained at sub-lethal levels within cells remains however poorly understood, especially in vivo. Thanks to its transparency and accessibility, the zebrafish offers the unique ability to directly visualize caspase activation in vivo. Yet, detailed information about the caspase family in zebrafish is lacking. Here, we report the identification and characterization of 19 different caspase genes in zebrafish, and show that caspases have diverse expression profiles from cleavage to larval stages, suggesting highly specialized and/or redundant functions during embryonic development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olivia Spead, Tine Verreet, Cory J.

Seizures occur in a recurrent manner with intermittent states of interictal and ictal discharges (IIDs and IDs). The transitions to and from IDs are determined by a set of processes, including synaptic interaction and ionic dynamics. Although mathematical models of separate types of epileptic discharges have been developed, modeling the transitions between states remains a challenge. A simple generic mathematical model of seizure dynamics (Epileptor) has recently been proposed by Jirsa et al. (2014); however, it is formulated in terms of abstract variables. In this paper, a minimal population-type model of IIDs and IDs is proposed that is as simple to use as the Epileptor, but the suggested model attributes physical meaning to the variables. The model is expressed in ordinary differential equations for extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium concentrations, membrane potential, and short-term synaptic depression variables. A quadratic integrate-and-fire model driven by the population input current is used to reproduce spike trains in a representative neuron. In simulations, potassium accumulation governs the transition from the silent state to the state of an ID. Each ID is composed of clustered IID-like events. The sodium accumulates during discharge and activates the sodium-potassium pump, which terminates the ID by restoring the potassium gradient and thus polarizing the neuronal membranes. The whole-cell and cell-attached recordings of a 4-AP-based in vitro model of epilepsy confirmed the primary model assumptions and predictions. The mathematical analysis revealed that the IID-like events are large-amplitude stochastic oscillations, which in the case of ID generation are controlled by slow oscillations of ionic concentrations.

Seizures occur in a recurrent manner with intermittent states of interictal and ictal discharges (IIDs and IDs). The transitions to and from IDs are determined by a set of processes, including synaptic interaction and ionic dynamics. Although mathematical models of separate types of epileptic discharges have been developed, modeling the transitions between states remains a challenge. A simple generic mathematical model of seizure dynamics (Epileptor) has recently been proposed by Jirsa et al. (2014); however, it is formulated in terms of abstract variables. In this paper, a minimal population-type model of IIDs and IDs is proposed that is as simple to use as the Epileptor, but the suggested model attributes physical meaning to the variables. The model is expressed in ordinary differential equations for extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium concentrations, membrane potential, and short-term synaptic depression variables. A quadratic integrate-and-fire model driven by the population input current is used to reproduce spike trains in a representative neuron. In simulations, potassium accumulation governs the transition from the silent state to the state of an ID. Each ID is composed of clustered IID-like events. The sodium accumulates during discharge and activates the sodium-potassium pump, which terminates the ID by restoring the potassium gradient and thus polarizing the neuronal membranes. The whole-cell and cell-attached recordings of a 4-AP-based in vitro model of epilepsy confirmed the primary model assumptions and predictions. The mathematical analysis revealed that the IID-like events are large-amplitude stochastic oscillations, which in the case of ID generation are controlled by slow oscillations of ionic concentrations. The IDs originate in the conditions of elevated potassium concentrations in a bath solution via a saddle-node-on-invariant-circle-like bifurcation for a non-smooth dynamical system. By providing a minimal biophysical description of ionic dynamics and network interactions, the model may serve as a hierarchical base from a simple to more complex modeling of seizures.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XazCEKR1hck&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><recrawled>1527799331879</recrawled><title>Minimal model of interictal and ictal discharges “Epileptor-2”</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006186</link><crawled>1527788607719</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163b74c18e7:c75cd:ed160cc3</id><published>1527800400000</published><engagementRate>3.0</engagementRate><updated>1527800400000</updated><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006186</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006172</originId><fingerprint>f0cb675</fingerprint><author><name>Carlos Espinosa-Soto</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Eh0FCzbR2R4/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Espinosa-Soto&lt;/p&gt;
Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eh0FCzbR2R4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Espinosa-Soto&lt;/p&gt;

The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women). Two other trajectories showed a more pronounced decline. Smoking and the presence of respiratory complaints were the best predictors of a trajectory with stronger decline. A greater BMI over the follow-up period was associated with a more unfavorable FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; course both in men (β = -0.027 (SD = 0.002); P &amp;lt; 0.001) and in women (β = -0.008 (SD = 0.001); P &amp;lt; 0.001). Smokers at baseline who quit the habit during follow-up, showed smaller decline in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison to persistent smokers, independent of BMI change (In men β = -0.074 (SD = 0.020); P &amp;lt; 0.001. In women β = -0.277 (SD = 0.068); P &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, three typical trajectories of age-related FEV1 decline could be distinguished. Change in the lifestyle related risk factors, BMI and smoking, significantly impact aging-related decline of lung function. Identifying deviant trajectories may help in early recognition of those at risk of a diagnosis of lung disease later in life.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sandra H. van Oostrom, Peter M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids (OCSFA) have been associated with potential health benefits. Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (&lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt;) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found no genome-wide significant evidence that common genetic variation is associated with circulating levels of C15:0 or C23:0. In two cohorts with available data, we identified one intronic SNP (rs13361131) in myosin X gene (&lt;i&gt;MYO10)&lt;/i&gt; associated with C17:0 level (P = 1.37×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;), and two intronic SNP (rs12874278 and rs17363566) in deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (&lt;i&gt;DLEU1)&lt;/i&gt; region associated with C19:0 level (P = 7.07×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, when using a candidate-gene approach, we found evidence that three SNPs in &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; (rs11884924, rs16832067, and rs3816088) are associated with circulating C17:0 level (adjusted P = 4×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, nine SNPs in the ceramide synthase 4 (&lt;i&gt;CERS4)&lt;/i&gt; region were associated with circulating C23:0 levels (adjusted P&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that circulating levels of OCSFA may be predominantly influenced by non-genetic factors. SNPs associated with C17:0 level in the &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; gene may reflect genetic influence in dairy consumption or in metabolism of dairy foods.

The hydrography and dynamics of NW Iberian margin were explored for July 2009, based on a set of in situ and remote sensing observations. Zonal sections of standard CTD casts, towed CTD (SeaSoar), Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and Lagrangian surveys were made to characterize cycles of upwelling and relaxation in this region. Two periods of northerly winds, bounded by relaxation periods, were responsible for the formation of an upwelling front extending to the shelf edge. An equatorward flow was quickly set up on the shelf responding to the northerly wind pulses. South of Cape Silleiro, the development and subsequent relaxation of an upwelling event was intensively surveyed in the shelf, following a Lagrangian drifter transported by the upwelling jet. This region is part of an upwelling center extending from Cape Silleiro to Porto, where the surface temperature was colder than the neighboring regions, under upwelling favorable winds. As these winds relaxed, persistent poleward flow developed, originating south of the upwelling center and consisting in an inner-shelf tongue of warm waters. During an event of strong southerly wind, the poleward flow was observed to extend to the whole continental shelf. Although the cruise was executed during summertime, the presence of river-plumes was observed over the shelf. The interaction of the plumes with the circulation on the shelf was also described in terms of coastal convergence and offshore advection.

People who have been advocating this for years will now get a chance to see how it works out in practice – and in fact, I would encourage them to go ahead and put down some predictions about what they think might happen. Predicting that not much will change, or that it will be hard to notice the effects, etc., is not (to my mind) a particularly good answer for supporters of this approach, because one then wonders why it was worth going to the trouble at all. But I’m not a supporter, so that’s my prediction: little change, with potential for harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/10/right_to_try_here_we_go&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/20/stem_cells_the_center_of_right_to_try&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt; many times before, but in case my views aren’t clear, here we go: I think Right to Try laws are largely useless, and have the potential to cause actual harm disproportionate to the good they might do. I think that there are sincere, principled advocates for them, but at the same time, there are many people on that side of the issue who are either ill-informed about medical research or who are simply grandstanding for votes and popular support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, my biggest reasons for thinking this way are: (1) most investigational drugs don’t work. The failure rate in human clinical trials is around 90 per cent, and it’s been that way for a long time. (2) there are disease areas where a tragedy-of-the-commons situation will mean that controlled clinical trials (which are still the only way to determine if a new drug works) will be much more difficult to run under a “why wait for proof?” system (I have to note that the current bill restricts right-to-try to those patients who are ineligible for clinical trials, which is a good provision). (3) opening up unproven therapies could lead to a moral hazard, where it becomes lucrative to put useless-but-harmless “drug candidates” into “clinical trials” so you can charge desperate patients at “cost”. I mean every quotation mark in that last sentence. I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-24/right-to-try-drug-law-risks-exploiting-desperate-patients&quot;&gt;not the only person&lt;/a&gt; who thinks this way. My own suggestion for the last point has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dereklowe/status/826761000032600064&quot;&gt;already been made&lt;/a&gt;: antioxidant phytonutrients – i.e., dried grape juice pills – for Alzheimer’s. Won’t do a thing, but hey, you have the right to try ’em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/372440-hundreds-sign-on-to-letter-opposing-right-to-try-drug-bill&quot;&gt;empirical evidence&lt;/a&gt; for all of these positions. Many states have passed their own right-to-try laws (in various forms), and if there has been any decrease in human suffering or advance in medical knowledge through them, I have missed it. To get specific, when Colorado passed its own law in 2014, one of the first companies that announced plans to offer treatments under its provisions was a stem-cell company, Neuralstem. And guess what? None of their treatments &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4094360-neuralstem-doomed&quot;&gt;ever worked&lt;/a&gt;. Most things don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, I’m inclined to put this current legislation in the “grandstanding” category. That’s because, as I understand it, there are no provisions that any given company has to provide such an experimental drug for use. It might be better named “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/right-to-try-bill-passes-trump-to-sign-will-it-help-terminally-ill-patients/&quot;&gt;right to ask&lt;/a&gt;“, and the compassionate-use program already provides just that. What’s changed? Well, now that we have a brand new federal law, all sorts of politicians will be able to talk about how they brought lifesaving therapies directly to critically ill patients, shook up the horrible drug approval process, struck a blow for the common people and stuck it to the drug companies, and on and on. Not always a very instructive spectacle, politics.

Kidney immune cells play important roles in pathogenesis of many diseases, including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and transplant rejection. While studying murine kidney T cells, we serendipitously identified a kidney mononuclear phagocytic cell (MPC) subset characterized by intermediate surface expression of CD45 and CD11b. These CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPCs were further identified as F4/80&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cells, comprising ~17% of total CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in normal mouse kidney (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and virtually absent from all other organs examined except the heart. Systemic clodronate treatment had more significant depletive effect on the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; population (77.3%±5.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) than on CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population (14.8%±16.6%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.49). In addition, CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; MPCs had higher phagocytic function in the normal kidney (35.6%±3.3% vs. 24.1%±2.2%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04), but lower phagocytic capacity in post-ischemic kidney (54.9%±1.0% vs. 67.8%±1.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) compared to the CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population. Moreover, the CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; population had higher intracellular production of the pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (58.4%±5.2% vs. 27.3%±0.9%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and lower production of the anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 (7.2%±1.3% vs. 14.9%±2.2%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) following kidney IRI, suggesting a functional role under inflammatory conditions. The CD45&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;int&lt;/sup&gt; cells increased early after IRI, and then abruptly decreased 48h later, whereas CD45&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells steadily increased after IRI before declining at 72h (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03).

Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective human hair growth–modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth–promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non–immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-d2BFNTwPU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan J.

Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non–immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-d2BFNTwPU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><title>Identifying novel strategies for treating human hair loss disorders: Cyclosporine A suppresses the Wnt inhibitor, SFRP1, in the dermal papilla of human scalp hair follicles</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003705</link><crawled>1525816154670</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16341bada2e:5f868a:3dd877af</id><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003705</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><description>I mentioned last year that Merck’s BACE inhibitor trial for Alzheimer’s had been stopped for futility.

Now here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1706441&quot;&gt;the full writeup&lt;/a&gt; in NEJM, and futility appears to have been &lt;em&gt;le mot juste&lt;/em&gt;. There were two treatment groups (12 mg and 40 mg), and in neither one did the ADAS-cog or ADAS-ADL scores (scales for degree of dementia and ability to function) improve whatsoever. There was no difference in the people who had been scored at the start with milder Alzheimer’s, and no difference related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E#Alzheimer%27s_disease&quot;&gt;APOE4 status&lt;/a&gt;. The placebo group in general declined at a normal Alzheimer’s rate, so that’s not the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many other markers examined, and in every case treatment did nothing at all or did things that are hard to interpret, such as decreasing hippocampal volume (which has been noted in other anti-amyloid studies, and whose significance is actually not well understood). And all this was while cerebrospinal fluid measurements showed that all the amyloid species assayed decreased sharply in the treatment groups. This compound lowered 1-40 amyloid-beta, it lowered 1-42, it lowered APP-beta, all by like 70% and more, decreased brain amyloid itself (by PET imaging) and &lt;em&gt;nothing happened&lt;/em&gt;. An intelligent space alien with no history in human Alzheimer’s research would examine these results and conclude that the hypothesis that reducing cerebral amyloid is beneficial is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. The paper comes out and states as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past the efficacy data, or lack of same, the adverse events with drug treatment were notably higher, and in a dose-responsive manner. These included falls, weight loss, sleep disturbance, change in hair color, and suicidal ideation (that last one technically mild, but definitely real). So not only was there no benefit, there was some actual harm, which makes halting the trial absolutely the correct decision to make. But there &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13543784.2017.1369527?journalCode=ieid20&quot;&gt;are still&lt;/a&gt; BACE clinical trials &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/merck-study-may-signal-doom-for-a-broad-group-of-pivotal-alzheimers-studies/&quot;&gt;going on&lt;/a&gt;, and if you weren’t pessimistic about them before this trial, you should be now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/04/mercks-bace-inhibitor-alzheimers-wipeout</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><engagement>56</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13513</link><crawled>1525445705334</crawled><summary><content>I mentioned last year that Merck’s BACE inhibitor trial for Alzheimer’s had been stopped for futility.

Electroporation of zygotes represents a rapid alternative to the elaborate pronuclear injection procedure for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mice. However, current protocols for electroporation either require the investment in specialized electroporators or corrosive pre-treatment of zygotes which compromises embryo viability. Here, we describe an easily adaptable approach for the introduction of specific mutations in C57BL/6 mice by electroporation of intact zygotes using a common electroporator with synthetic CRISPR/Cas9 components and minimal technical requirement. Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring. Hence, our novel approach for Easy Electroporation of Zygotes (EEZy) allows highly efficient generation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic mice while reducing the numbers of animals required.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simon E.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell’s machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp, and &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhila Esna Ashari, Nairanjana Dasgupta, Kelly A.

Although numerous studies have investigated the neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately each other, it is unclear whether an association between neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity is present. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional changes in hippocampus before and after treatment with escitalopram and to associate these changes with peptides related to neuronal growth in patients with chronic PTSD and trauma survivors without PTSD. Fifteen earthquake survivors with chronic PTSD and thirteen drug naïve trauma exposed individuals without PTSD underwent fMRI scans in a block design. Serum levels of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) were measured before and after 12 weeks treatment with escitalopram. Baseline median serum level of NGF was significantly lower in patients with chronic PTSD than trauma survivors; however, 12 weeks of treatment with escitalopram significantly increased it. Higher activation was found both in left and right hippocampus for chronic PTSD group than trauma survivors. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with suppression of the hyperactivation in left hippocampus in patients with chronic PTSD. Bilateral hyperactivation in hippocampus and lowered NGF may associate with neurobiological disarrangements in chronic PTSD. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with both improvement in the severity of PTSD symptoms and biological alterations. Patients diagnosed with PTSD may have further and complicated deteriorations in hippocampal networks and neurotransmitter systems than individuals who had not been diagnosed with PTSD following the same traumatic experience.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ümit Tural, Ahmet Tamer Aker, Emin Önder, Hatice Turan Sodan, Hatice Ünver, Gür Akansel&lt;/p&gt;

The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, “self” protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of “self” antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Frasca, Alain Diaz, Maria Romero, Seth Thaller, Bonnie B.

Pyrrole-imidazole (Py–Im) polyamides are synthetic non-genotoxic minor groove-binding small molecules. We hypothesized that Py–Im polyamides can modulate the cellular response to ionizing radiation. Pre-treatment of cells with a Py-Im polyamide prior to exposure to ionizing radiation resulted in a delay in resolution of phosphorylated γ-H2AX foci, increase in XRCC1 foci, and reduced cellular replication potential. RNA-sequencing of cell lines exposed to the polyamide showed induction of genes related to the ultraviolet radiation response. We observed that the polyamide is almost 10-fold more toxic to a cell line deficient in DNA ligase 3 as compared to the parental cell line. Alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis reveals that the polyamide induces genomic fragmentation in the ligase 3 deficient cell line but not the corresponding parental line. The polyamide interferes directly with DNA ligation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We conclude that Py-Im polyamides may be further explored as sensitizers to genotoxic therapies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Diaz-Perez, Nathanael Kane, Alexis A.

Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yui K.

In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</description><unread>True</unread><title>The enhancement effect of estradiol on contextual fear conditioning in female mice</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197441</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197441</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8e:93d646dc</id><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197329</originId><fingerprint>4486bc6d</fingerprint><author><name>Johannes Denk</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197329</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Johannes Denk, Felix Oberhauser, Johannes Kornhuber, Jens Wiltfang, Klaus Fassbender, Matthias L.

Information on circulating miRNAs in frontotemporal lobar degeneration is very limited and conflicting results have complicated an interpretation in Alzheimer’s disease thus far. In the present study we I) collected samples from multiple clinical centers across Germany, II) defined 3 homogenous patient groups with high sample sizes (bvFTD n = 48, AD n = 48 and cognitively healthy controls n = 44), III) compared expression levels in both CSF and serum samples and IV) detected a limited set of miRNAs by using a MIQE compliant protocol based on SYBR-green miRCURY assays that have proven reliable to generate reproducible results. We included several quality controls that identified and reduced technical variation to increase the reliability of our data. We showed that the expression levels of circulating miRNAs measured in CSF did not correlate with levels in serum. Using cluster analysis we found expression pattern in serum that, in part, reflects the genomic organization and affiliation to a specific miRNA family and that were specifically altered in bvFTD, AD, and control groups. Applying factor analysis we identified a 3-factor model characterized by a miRNA signature that explained 80% of the variance classifying healthy controls with 97%, bvFTD with 77% and AD with 72% accuracy. MANOVA confirmed signals like miR-320a and miR-26b-5p at BH corrected significance that contributed most to discriminate bvFTD cases with 96% sensitivity and 90% specificity and AD cases with 89% sensitivity and specificity compared to healthy controls, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that miRNAs from the 3-factor model also correlated with levels of protein biomarker amyloid-beta&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, indicating their potential role in the monitoring of progressive neuronal degeneration. Our data show that miRNAs can be reproducibly measured in serum and CSF without pre-amplification and that serum includes higher expressed signals that demonstrate an overall better ability to classify bvFTD, AD and healthy controls compared to signals detected in CSF.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Johannes Denk, Felix Oberhauser, Johannes Kornhuber, Jens Wiltfang, Klaus Fassbender, Matthias L.

In mountainous landscapes, soil moisture is highly dynamic due to the effects of topography and the temporal variability imposed by seasonal precipitation, including rainfall and snow. Soil moisture is known to affect ecosystem carbon exchange both aboveground and belowground, as well as the stable isotopic composition of exchanged CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this study we used an extensive suite of measurements to examine the effects of seasonal changes in soil moisture on the isotopic composition of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at the landscape level. We show that the seasonal decline in soil moisture (i.e., summer dry-down) appeared to impose a trend in the δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) with more negative δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; early in the growing season when soils were wet, and more positive δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; as the growing season progressed and soils dried out. This seemingly generalizable pattern for a snow-dominated watershed is likely to represent the variability of recently assimilated C, tracked through the plant-soil system and imprinted in the respired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, our observations suggest that, at least for mountainous environments, seasonal changes in δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; are largely mediated by soil moisture and their spatial variability is partially organized by topography.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego A.

Interventions to enhance mental health and well-being within high risk industries such as the emergency services have typically focused on individual-level factors, though there is increasing interest in the role of organisational-level interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of different aspects of manager support in determining the mental health of ambulance personnel. A cross-sectional survey was completed by ambulance personnel across two Australian states (N = 1,622). Demographics, manager support and mental health measures were assessed. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to determine the explanatory influence of the employee’s perception of the priority management places upon mental health issues (manager psychosocial safety climate) and managers’ observed behaviours (manager behaviour) on employee common mental disorder and well-being within ambulance personnel. Of the 1,622 participants, 123 (7.6%) were found to be suffering from a likely mental disorder. Manager psychosocial safety climate accounted for a significant amount of the variance in levels of employee common mental health disorder symptoms (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01). Manager behaviour had a lesser, but still statistically significant influence upon symptoms of common mental disorder (7% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (10% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.05). The perceived importance management places on mental health and managers’ actual behaviour are related but distinct concepts, and each appears to impact employee mental health. While the overall variance explained by each factor was limited, the fact that each is potentially modifiable makes this finding important and highlights the significance of organisational and team-level interventions to promote employee well-being within emergency services and other high-risk occupations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine Petrie, Aimée Gayed, Bridget T.

Here we report RAVEN Toolbox 2.0 with major enhancements, including: (i) de novo reconstruction of GEMs based on the MetaCyc pathway database; (ii) a redesigned KEGG-based reconstruction pipeline; (iii) convergence of reconstructions from various sources; (iv) improved performance, usability, and compatibility with COBRA Toolbox. Capabilities of RAVEN 2.0 were demonstrated through de novo reconstruction of GEMs for the antibiotic-producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Comparison of the automated de novo reconstruction with iMK1208, a previously published high-quality S. coelicolor GEM, demonstrated that RAVEN 2.0 captures most of the manually curated model. The generated de novo reconstruction was subsequently used to curate iMK1208 resulting in Sco4, the most comprehensive GEM of S. coelicolor, with increased coverage of both primary and secondary metabolism.

As such, we demonstrate how RAVEN 2.0 can not only be used for de novo GEM reconstruction, but also for curating existing models based on up-to-date databases.

Here we report RAVEN Toolbox 2.0 with major enhancements, including: (i) de novo reconstruction of GEMs based on the MetaCyc pathway database; (ii) a redesigned KEGG-based reconstruction pipeline; (iii) convergence of reconstructions from various sources; (iv) improved performance, usability, and compatibility with COBRA Toolbox. Capabilities of RAVEN 2.0 were demonstrated through de novo reconstruction of GEMs for the antibiotic-producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Comparison of the automated de novo reconstruction with iMK1208, a previously published high-quality S. coelicolor GEM, demonstrated that RAVEN 2.0 captures most of the manually curated model. The generated de novo reconstruction was subsequently used to curate iMK1208 resulting in Sco4, the most comprehensive GEM of S. coelicolor, with increased coverage of both primary and secondary metabolism. This increased coverage allowed the use of Sco4 to predict novel genome editing targets for optimized secondary metabolites production.

Facial reconstruction is a technique that aims to reproduce the individual facial characteristics based on interpretation of the skull, with the objective of recognition leading to identification. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy and recognition level of three-dimensional (3D) computerized forensic craniofacial reconstruction (CCFR) performed in a blind test on open-source software using computed tomography (CT) data from live subjects. Four CCFRs were produced by one of the researchers, who was provided with information concerning the age, sex, and ethnic group of each subject. The CCFRs were produced using Blender&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; with 3D models obtained from the CT data and templates from the MakeHuman&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; program. The evaluation of accuracy was carried out in CloudCompare, by geometric comparison of the CCFR to the subject 3D face model (obtained from the CT data). A recognition level was performed using the Picasa&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; recognition tool with a frontal standardized photography, images of the subject CT face model and the CCFR. Soft-tissue depth and nose, ears and mouth were based on published data, observing Brazilian facial parameters. The results were presented from all the points that form the CCFR model, with an average for each comparison between 63% and 74% with a distance -2.5 ≤ x ≤ 2.5 mm from the skin surface. The average distances were 1.66 to 0.33 mm and greater distances were observed around the eyes, cheeks, mental and zygomatic regions. Two of the four CCFRs were correctly matched by the Picasa&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; tool. Free software programs are capable of producing 3D CCFRs with plausible levels of accuracy and recognition and therefore indicate their value for use in forensic applications.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Geraldo Elias Miranda, Caroline Wilkinson, Mark Roughley, Thiago Leite Beaini, Rodolfo Francisco Haltenhoff Melani&lt;/p&gt;

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease, with considerable genetic contribution. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified a number of genomic regions for the risk of psoriasis. However, it is challenging to pinpoint the functional causal variants and then further decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying each region. In order to prioritize potential functional causal variants within psoriasis susceptibility regions, we integrated the genetic association findings and functional genomic data publicly available, i.e. histone modifications in relevant immune cells. We characterized a pervasive enrichment pattern of psoriasis variants in five core histone marks across immune cells/tissues. We discovered that genetic alleles within psoriasis association regions might influence gene expression levels through significantly affecting the binding affinities of 17 transcription factors. We established a catalog of 654 potential functional causal variants for psoriasis and suggested that they significantly overlapped with causal variants for autoimmune diseases. We identified potential causal variant rs79824801 overlay with the peaks of five histone marks in primary CD4+ T cells. Its alternative allele affected the binding affinity of transcription factor &lt;i&gt;IKZF1&lt;/i&gt;. This study highlights the complex genetic architecture and complicated mechanisms for psoriasis.

Arbuscular Mycorrhiza and Root Nodule Symbiosis are symbiotic interactions with a high benefit for plant growth and crop production. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the developmental process of these symbioses in detail. We analysed very early symbiotic responses of &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula&lt;/i&gt; root hair cells, by stimulation with lipochitinoligosaccharides specific for the induction of nodules (Nod-LCOs), or the interaction with mycorrhiza (Myc-LCOs). Intracellular micro electrodes were used, in combination with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitive reporter dyes, to study the relations between cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and membrane potential changes.

Arbuscular Mycorrhiza and Root Nodule Symbiosis are symbiotic interactions with a high benefit for plant growth and crop production. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the developmental process of these symbioses in detail. We analysed very early symbiotic responses of &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula&lt;/i&gt; root hair cells, by stimulation with lipochitinoligosaccharides specific for the induction of nodules (Nod-LCOs), or the interaction with mycorrhiza (Myc-LCOs). Intracellular micro electrodes were used, in combination with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitive reporter dyes, to study the relations between cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and membrane potential changes. We found that sulfated Myc- as well as Nod-LCOs initiate a membrane depolarization, which depends on the chemical composition of these signaling molecules, as well as the genotype of the plants that were studied. A successive application of sulfated Myc-LCOs and Nod-LCOs resulted only in a single transient depolarization, indicating that Myc-LCOs can repress plasma membrane responses to Nod-LCOs. In contrast to current models, the Nod-LCO-induced depolarization precedes changes in the cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level of root hair cells.

Animal paths are analogous to intractable mathematical problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the shortest path problem (SPP). Both the TSP and SPP require an individual to find the shortest path through multiple targets but the TSP demands a return to the start, while the SPP does not. Vervet monkeys are very efficient in solving TSPs but this species is a multiple central place forager that does not always return to the same sleeping site and thus theoretically should be selected to find solutions to SPPs rather than TSPs. We examined path choice by wild vervets in an SPP experimental array where the shortest paths usually differed from those consistent with common heuristic strategies, the nearest-neighbor rule (NNR–go to the closest resource that has not been visited), and the convex hull (put a mental loop around sites, adding inner targets in order of distance from the edge)–an efficient strategy for TSPs but not SPPs. In addition, humans solving SPPs use an initial segment strategy (ISS–choose the straightest path at the beginning, only turning when necessary) and we looked at vervet paths consistent with this strategy. In 615 trials by single foragers, paths usually conformed to the NNR and rarely the slightly more efficient convex hull, supporting that vervets may be selected to solve SPPs. Further, like humans solving SPPs, vervets showed a tendency to use the ISS. Paths consistent with heuristics dropped off sharply, and use of the shortest path increased, when heuristics led to longer paths showing trade-offs in efficiency versus cognitive load. Two individuals out of 17, found the shortest path most often, showing inter-individual variation in path planning. Given support for the NNR and the ISS, we propose a new rule-of-thumb termed the “region heuristic” that vervets may apply in multi-destination routes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julie Annette Teichroeb, Eve Ann Smeltzer&lt;/p&gt;

Two individuals out of 17, found the shortest path most often, showing inter-individual variation in path planning. Given support for the NNR and the ISS, we propose a new rule-of-thumb termed the “region heuristic” that vervets may apply in multi-destination routes.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Vervet monkey (&amp;lt;i&gt;Chlorocebus pygerythrus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) behavior in a multi-destination route: Evidence for planning ahead when heuristics fail</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198076</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198076</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1c:3dd877af</id><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05262-2</originId><fingerprint>efa0c056</fingerprint><author><name>Richard Rhodes</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05262-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aldous Huxley’s nuclear dystopia at 70: Ape and Essence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aldous Huxley’s nuclear dystopia at 70: Ape and Essence, Published online: 30 May 2018;

The ability to arrange thoughts and actions in an appropriate serial order (the problem of serial order) is essential to complex behaviors such as language, reasoning and cognitive planning. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1–2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA≥26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21≤MoCA≤25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test. The ordering cost increased as a function of age across groups, indicating an aging-related decline in the ability of serial ordering. However, individual patients’ task performances were not correlated with their severity or duration of motor symptoms, or daily exposure to dopaminergic drugs. These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinghong Ma, Shaoyang Ma, Haiqiang Zou, Yizhi Zhang, Piu Chan, Zheng Ye&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The topical HIV prevention (microbicides) field is in acute need of a method to rapidly and objectively measure adherence to product use in clinical trials. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has been used in many pharmaceutical and forensic applications but has yet to be applied to adherence monitoring. In this study, we report on efforts to test the feasibility of using IR spectroscopy as a means to measure residual active or placebo vaginal product, semen exposure and vaginal insertion from a single swab.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A portable IR spectrometer equipped with diamond attenuated total reflectance (ATR) was used to capture spectra of unused vs. vaginally-used swabs, vaginal swabs containing semen, and vaginal swabs to which either tenofovir-containing or matching placebo products (vaginal gel or insert) were added. Spectral data obtained from swabs placed directly on the spectrometer were divided into calibration and testing sets for developing and validating discriminant models set up to provide yes/no predictions of: vaginal vs. non-vaginal use, presence vs. no presence of each test product, and presence vs. no presence of semen. Further validation of models was performed using vaginal swabs collected from a clinical study evaluating vaginally administered placebo insert formulations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For each discriminant model developed to predict vaginal vs. non-vaginal use, presence vs. no presence of each test product, and presence vs. no presence of semen, classified validation samples not included in the model development were correctly identified into their respective classes with minimal prediction error. Clinically obtained vaginal swabs collected 15–60 minutes after placebo insert use were also correctly identified, further validating the models.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate the proof of concept that IR spectroscopy can be a method for rapid detection and characterization of microbicide products and biological fluids present in vaginal swabs.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinju Ma, Liyi Ma, Hong Zhang, Zhongquan Zhang, Youqiong Wang, Kai Li, Xiaoming Chen&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><title>Policosanol fabrication from insect wax and optimization by response surface methodology</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197343</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197343</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b81:93d646dc</id><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/103648v5?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>490fc7da</fingerprint><author><name>Duong, D.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/103648v5?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>The Gene Ontology (GO) database contains GO terms that describe biological functions of genes.

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne bacterial infection that is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. If not treated with antibiotics during the early stages of infection, disseminated infection can spread to the central nervous system (CNS). In non-human primates (NHPs) it has been demonstrated that the leptomeninges are among the tissues colonized by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; spirochetes. Although the NHP model parallels aspects of human borreliosis, a small rodent model would be ideal to study the trafficking of spirochetes and immune cells into the CNS. Here we show that during early and late disseminated infection, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; infects the meninges of intradermally infected mice, and is associated with concurrent increases in meningeal T cells. We found that the dura mater was consistently culture positive for spirochetes in transcardially perfused mice, independent of the strain of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; used. Within the dura mater, spirochetes were preferentially located in vascular regions, but were also present in perivascular, and extravascular regions, as late as 75 days post-infection. At the same end-point, we observed significant increases in the number of CD3+ T cells within the pia and dura mater, as compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes isolated from the dura mater revealed that CD3+ cell populations were comprised of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that similarly to infection in peripheral tissues, spirochetes adhere to the dura mater during disseminated infection, and are associated with increases in the number of meningeal T cells.

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne bacterial infection that is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. If not treated with antibiotics during the early stages of infection, disseminated infection can spread to the central nervous system (CNS). In non-human primates (NHPs) it has been demonstrated that the leptomeninges are among the tissues colonized by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; spirochetes. Although the NHP model parallels aspects of human borreliosis, a small rodent model would be ideal to study the trafficking of spirochetes and immune cells into the CNS. Here we show that during early and late disseminated infection, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; infects the meninges of intradermally infected mice, and is associated with concurrent increases in meningeal T cells. We found that the dura mater was consistently culture positive for spirochetes in transcardially perfused mice, independent of the strain of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; used. Within the dura mater, spirochetes were preferentially located in vascular regions, but were also present in perivascular, and extravascular regions, as late as 75 days post-infection. At the same end-point, we observed significant increases in the number of CD3+ T cells within the pia and dura mater, as compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes isolated from the dura mater revealed that CD3+ cell populations were comprised of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that similarly to infection in peripheral tissues, spirochetes adhere to the dura mater during disseminated infection, and are associated with increases in the number of meningeal T cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are aspects of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; meningeal infection that can be modelled in laboratory mice, suggesting that mice may be useful for elucidating mechanisms of meningeal pathogenesis by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;.</description><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&amp;lt;/i&gt; adhere to blood vessels in the dura mater and are associated with increased meningeal T cells during murine disseminated borreliosis</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196893</link><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196893</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aeb:5785ab88</id><published>1525381200000</published><updated>1525381200000</updated></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006113</originId><fingerprint>4ae91fb0</fingerprint><author><name>Thanos Manos</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rx9Yjw7JXhk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>3</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thanos Manos, Magteld Zeitler, Peter A.

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP. For this purpose, CR stimulation was applied with Rapidly Varying Sequences (RVS) as well as with Slowly Varying Sequences (SVS) in a wide range of stimulation frequencies and intensities. Our findings demonstrate that acute desynchronization, achieved during stimulation, does not necessarily lead to long-term desynchronization after cessation of stimulation. By comparing the long-term effects of the two different CR protocols, the RVS CR stimulation turned out to be more robust against variations of the stimulation frequency. However, SVS CR stimulation can obtain stronger anti-kindling effects. We revealed specific parameter ranges that are favorable for long-term desynchronization. For instance, RVS CR stimulation at weak intensities and with stimulation frequencies in the range of the neuronal firing rates turned out to be effective and robust, in particular, if no closed loop adaptation of stimulation parameters is (technically) available. From a clinical standpoint, this may be relevant in the context of both invasive as well as non-invasive CR stimulation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rx9Yjw7JXhk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thanos Manos, Magteld Zeitler, Peter A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Placental dysfunction is related to many pregnancy complications, but collecting placental specimens for investigation in large scale epidemiologic studies is often infeasible. Standard procedures involving immediate collection after birth and snap freezing are often cost prohibitive. We aimed to collect pilot data regarding the feasibility and precision of a simpler approach, the collection of tissue samples following 24 hours of refrigeration of whole placentae at 4°C, as compared to the “gold standard” of snap freezing excised tissue within 40 minutes of delivery for the assessment of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Placentae were collected from 12 women after delivering live-born singleton babies via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Two placentae were utilized to establish laboratory tissue processing and assay protocols. The other 10 placentae were utilized in a comparison of three tissue collection conditions. Specifically, key inflammatory cytokines were measured in 3 sections, representing three collection conditions.

Influenza A virus infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and currently available prevention and treatment methods are suboptimal. In recent years, genome-wide investigations have revealed numerous host factors that are required for influenza to successfully complete its life cycle. However, only a select, small number of influenza strains were evaluated using this platform, and there was considerable variation in the genes identified across different investigations. In an effort to develop a universally efficacious therapeutic strategy with limited potential for the emergence of resistance, this study was performed to investigate the effect of combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) on inhibiting the replication of diverse influenza A virus subtypes and strains. Candidate genes were selected for targeting based on the results of multiple previous independent genome-wide studies. The effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on the replication of 12 diverse influenza A viruses, including three strains isolated from birds and one strain isolated from seals, was then evaluated in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. After excluding overly toxic siRNA, two siRNA combinations were identified that reduced mean viral replication by greater than 79 percent in all mammalian strains, and greater than 68 percent in all avian strains. Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael A.

Background &lt;p&gt;The weekend effect describes a phenomenon whereby patients admitted to hospitals on weekends are at higher risk of complications compared to those admitted during weekdays.

Primary outcome measures were one-year patient and graft survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;364 deceased donor livers were transplanted into 329 patients with 246 weekday (74.77%) and 83 weekend (25.23%) patients. Potential confounders (e.g. age, ischemia time, MELD score) were comparable. One-year patient and graft survival were similar. Frequencies of rejections, primary-non function or re-transplantation were not different. The day of transplantation was not associated with one-year patient and graft survival in multivariate analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We provide the first data for the Eurotransplant region on oLT stratified for weekend and weekday procedures and our findings suggest there was no weekend effect on oLT. While we hypothesize that the absent weekend effect is due to standardized transplant procedures and specialized multidisciplinary transplant teams, our results are encouraging showing oLT is a safe and successful procedure, independent from the day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Felix Becker, Thomas Vogel, Thekla Voß, Anne-Sophie Mehdorn, Katharina Schütte-Nütgen, Stefan Reuter, Annika Mohr, Iyad Kabar, Eike Bormann, Thorsten Vowinkel, Daniel Palmes, Norbert Senninger, Ralf Bahde, Linus Kebschull&lt;/p&gt;

Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells primarily by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in the β-cell membrane. The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Proks, Holger Kramer, Elizabeth Haythorne, Frances M.

In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Binding of sulphonylureas to plasma proteins – A K&amp;lt;sub&gt;ATP&amp;lt;/sub&gt; channel perspective</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543a:93d646dc</id><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated></item><item><description>How genetic variation is generated and maintained remains a central question in evolutionary biology.

Colorectal epithelial tumors occur spontaneously in dogs, and the pathogenesis seems to parallel that of humans. The development of human colorectal tumorigenesis has been linked to alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. This study characterized the fecal- and mucosa-associated microbiota in dogs with colorectal epithelial tumors (n = 10). The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA analysis and compared with that of control dogs (n = 13). We also determined the mucosa-associated microbiota composition in colonic tumor tissue (n = 8) and in adjacent non-tumor tissue (n = 5) by 16S rDNA- and rRNA profiling. The fecal microbial community structure in dogs with tumors was different from that of control samples and was distinguished by oligotypes affiliated with &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Porphyromonas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Peptostreptococcus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt;, and lower abundance of &lt;i&gt;Ruminococcaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Slackia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clostridium&lt;/i&gt; XI and &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/i&gt;. The overall community structure and populations of mucosal bacteria were not different based on either the 16S rDNA or the 16S rRNA profile in tumor tissue &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, the proportion of live, potentially active bacteria appeared to be higher in non-tumor tissue compared with tumor tissue and included &lt;i&gt;Slackia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Roseburia&lt;/i&gt;, unclass. &lt;i&gt;Ruminococcaeceae&lt;/i&gt;, unclass. &lt;i&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Oscillibacter&lt;/i&gt;.

Women’s groups practicing participatory learning and action (PLA) in rural areas have been shown to improve maternal and newborn survival in low-income countries, but the pathways from intervention to impact remain unclear. We assessed the long-term impact of a PLA intervention in rural Nepal on women’s agency in the household. In 2014, we conducted a follow-up study to a cluster randomised controlled trial on the impact of PLA women’s groups from 2001–2003. Agency was measured using the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) and its subdomains. Multi-level regression analyses were performed adjusting for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. We additionally adjusted for potential exposure to subsequent PLA groups based on women’s pregnancy status and conduct of PLA groups in areas of residence. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two alternative measures of agency. We analysed outcomes for 4030 mothers (66% of the cohort) who survived and were recruited to follow-up at mean age 39.6 years. Across a wide range of model specifications, we found no association between exposure to the original PLA intervention with women’s agency in the household approximately 11.5 years later. Subsequent exposure to PLA groups was not associated with greater agency in the household at follow-up, but some specifications found evidence for reduced agency. Household agency may be a prerequisite for actualising the benefits of PLA groups rather than a consequence.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lu Gram, Jolene Skordis-Worrall, Dharma S.

We show that dropout-based feature selection outperforms variance-based feature selection for multiple applications of single-cell RNASeq.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/065094v4?rss=1</link><crawled>1526582366413</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/17/065094</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636f6650cd:4a64355:3dd877af</id><published>1526540400000</published><title>Dropout-based feature selection for scRNASeq [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029373?af=R</originId><fingerprint>a8b38277</fingerprint><author><name>Piyush Mishra</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029373?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><title>Conformational explosion: Understanding the complexity of short chain para-dialkylbenzene potential energy surfaces</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029373?af=R</link><crawled>1526282826472</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1635d8bb2e8:2d2ccba:3dd877af</id><published>1525848665000</published><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197550</originId><fingerprint>8c0278ed</fingerprint><author><name>Hong-Wei Wang</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197550</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hong-Wei Wang, Hua-Ning Shi, Jia Cheng, Fang Xie, Yu-Kun Luo, Jie Tang&lt;/p&gt;
Purpose &lt;p&gt;The first aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between liver stiffness measurement, hepatic venous pressure and liver fibrosis. The second aim was to demonstrate the utility of real-time shear wave elastography for evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients before and after balloon hepatic venous angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 32 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome slated for successful balloon angioplasty met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Shear wave elastography was used to generate dynamic liver stiffness measurement 2 days before angioplasty and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty. Hepatic venous pressures were measured during balloon angioplasty. Correlations among liver stiffness, hepatic venous pressure, and fibrosis were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Mean liver stiffness was 35.17 ± 10.60 kPa, 20.15 ± 5.47 kPa, 15.36 ± 4.34 kPa and 15.68 ± 5.58 kPa at baseline and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty, respectively. Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001); liver stiffness measured at 6 months after angioplasty was not significantly different from that measured at 3 months after angioplasty (P = 0.636). Analysis of liver stiffness measurement and hepatic venous pressure before balloon angioplasty yielded a coefficient of correlation r = 0.701 (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Before and 2d after angioplasty, liver stiffness measurement did not correlated with fibrosis (r = − 0.170, P = 0.22), (r = 0.223, P = 0.220), respectively, while the LSM difference before and 2 days after angioplasty negatively correlated with stiffness severity (r = − 0.502, P = 0.003). Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001), remaining stable at 3 months, though still in the cirrhotic range.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The liver stiffness of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients, measured by shear wave elastography, decreased considerably after hepatic venous recanalization, and significantly correlated with hepatic venous pressure though not with degree of fibrosis. Shear wave elastography may be effective in monitoring short- and long-term treatment outcomes in Budd-Chiari syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hong-Wei Wang, Hua-Ning Shi, Jia Cheng, Fang Xie, Yu-Kun Luo, Jie Tang&lt;/p&gt;

Mesothelin is a cell surface protein that is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, liver, and pancreatic tumors. Aberrant expression of mesothelin has been shown to promote tumor progression and metastasis through interaction with established tumor biomarker CA125. Therefore, molecules that specifically bind to mesothelin have potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, no mesothelin-targeting molecules are currently approved for routine clinical use. While antibodies that target mesothelin are in development, some clinical applications may require a targeting molecule with an alternative protein fold. For example, non-antibody proteins are more suitable for molecular imaging and may facilitate diverse chemical conjugation strategies to create drug delivery complexes. In this work, we engineered variants of the fibronectin type III domain (Fn3) non-antibody protein scaffold to bind to mesothelin with high affinity, using directed evolution and yeast surface display. Lead engineered Fn3 variants were solubly produced and purified from bacterial culture at high yield. Upon specific binding to mesothelin on human cancer cell lines, the engineered Fn3 proteins internalized and co-localized to early endosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-antibody proteins engineered to bind mesothelin. The results validate that non-antibody proteins can be engineered to bind to tumor biomarker mesothelin, and encourage the continued development of engineered variants for applications such as targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allison R.

The stress-induced mutagenesis hypothesis postulates that in response to stress, bacteria increase their genome-wide mutation rate, in turn increasing the chances that a descendant is able to better withstand the stress. This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell divisions are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YW43eur48VA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

In pathology, Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of tissue sections is regularly used to diagnose and grade malignant tumors. Typically, IHC stain interpretation is rendered by a trained pathologist using a manual method, which consists of counting each positively- and negatively-stained cell under a microscope. The manual enumeration suffers from poor reproducibility even in the hands of expert pathologists. To facilitate this process, we propose a novel method to create artificial datasets with the known ground truth which allows us to analyze the recall, precision, accuracy, and intra- and inter-observer variability in a systematic manner, enabling us to compare different computer analysis approaches. Our method employs a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that uses a database of Ki67 stained tissues of breast cancer patients to generate synthetic digital slides. Our experiments show that synthetic images are indistinguishable from real images. Six readers (three pathologists and three image analysts) tried to differentiate 15 real from 15 synthetic images and the probability that the average reader would be able to correctly classify an image as synthetic or real more than 50% of the time was only 44.7%.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Caglar Senaras, Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi, Berkman Sahiner, Michael P.

Morphogen-sensing pathways exhibit diverse molecular architectures, whose roles in controlling patterning dynamics and precision have been unclear.

Individuals often respond differently to the same vaccine; some of this variation may be caused by genetic differences among animals. Our objective was to estimate heritability and identify genomic regions associated with humoral response to an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine in beef cattle. Crossbred beef cattle (n = 651) were vaccinated with a commercially available &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine. Serum was collected at time of initial vaccination (d 0), booster (d 21), and d 56 after initial vaccination. Total antibodies specific to siderophore receptor and porin proteins in the vaccine were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood and genotyped with the bovine GeneSeek Genomic Profiler-High Density 78K or 26K Single Nucleotide Polymorphism BeadChip and imputed to 777,000 SNP genotypes. Heritability was estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using both 1) pedigree and 2) genomic relationships among individuals. Fixed effects were contemporary group, calf age, sex, principal components from SNP genotype data, and pedigree-derived heterozygosity effects. Additive and dominance effects of SNPs were estimated individually while accounting for contemporary group, sex, and the top 20 principal components calculated from the genomic relationship matrix. Heritability of initial response to vaccination (d 21 –d 0) was 0.10 ± 0.175 using pedigree relationships and 0.14 ± 0.149 using genomic relationships, but neither estimate was statistically different from zero. Heritability of booster (d 56 –d 21) and overall (d 56 –d 0) responses were low and not statistically significant from zero. There were no clusters of linked SNP associated with vaccine response, but eight regionally isolated SNPs were significantly associated with initial or overall response to vaccination. Regional genetic variation for initial response to an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine was observed, although overall heritability of this response was not statistically significant from zero.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kara B.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;tuberous sclerosis complex 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TSC2)&lt;/i&gt;, a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like Growth Factor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-null and &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse &lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt; homolog &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt;, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We extended transcript-level findings to protein level, observing increased Igf2 protein expression and Igf2 secretion by &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. Increased Igf2 expression was not due to epigenetic imprinting, but was partially mediated through the Stat3 pathway and was completely insensitive to rapamycin treatment. An siRNA-mediated decrease of Igf2 resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting presence of an autocrine Igf2/Stat3 amplification cycle in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. In human pulmonary LAM lesions and metastatic cell clusters, high levels of IGF2 were associated with mTORC1 activation. In addition, treatment of three primary IGF2-expressing LAM lung cell lines with rapamycin did not result in IGF2 level changes. Thus, targeting of IGF2 signaling may be of therapeutic value to LAM patients, particularly those who are unresponsive to rapamycin.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Blanca E.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;tuberous sclerosis complex 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TSC2)&lt;/i&gt;, a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like Growth Factor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-null and &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse &lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt; homolog &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt;, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We extended transcript-level findings to protein level, observing increased Igf2 protein expression and Igf2 secretion by &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. Increased Igf2 expression was not due to epigenetic imprinting, but was partially mediated through the Stat3 pathway and was completely insensitive to rapamycin treatment. An siRNA-mediated decrease of Igf2 resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting presence of an autocrine Igf2/Stat3 amplification cycle in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. In human pulmonary LAM lesions and metastatic cell clusters, high levels of IGF2 were associated with mTORC1 activation. In addition, treatment of three primary IGF2-expressing LAM lung cell lines with rapamycin did not result in IGF2 level changes. Thus, targeting of IGF2 signaling may be of therapeutic value to LAM patients, particularly those who are unresponsive to rapamycin.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Rapamycin-independent &amp;lt;i&gt;IGF2&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression in &amp;lt;i&gt;Tsc2&amp;lt;/i&gt;-null mouse embryo fibroblasts and human lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197105</link><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197105</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd2:2835af05</id><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated></item><item><description>Recently identified Parkinson’s disease (PD) genes involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, such as DNAJC6 (auxilin), have further implicated synaptic dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.

Huntington’s disease (HD) age of onset (AO) is mainly determined by the length of the CAG repeat expansion in the &lt;i&gt;huntingtin&lt;/i&gt; gene. The remaining AO variability has been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the REGISTRY project of the European Huntington’s Disease Network. Multiple linear regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor symptoms 5–8 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp range (40–44). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable. However, given that most pre-HD AHT patients included in our study had started treatment with antihypertensive drugs prior to the onset of HD, and that antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to confer a neuroprotective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases, raises the interest in elucidating the impact of AHT and/or AHT treatment in HD age of onset in further studies. A confirmation of our results in a larger sample set would open the possibility to significantly improve HD management.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leire Valcárcel-Ocete, Asier Fullaondo, Gorka Alkorta-Aranburu, María García-Barcina, Raymund A.

Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chompunut Lumsangkul, Yang-Kwang Fan, Shen-Chang Chang, Jyh-Cherng Ju, Hsin-I.

This work presents an alternative device for cancer screening in liquid biopsies. It combines a biomimetic film (i) with electrochemical detection (ii). The biomimetic film (i) was obtained by electro-polymerizing amine-substituted benzene rings around a CA 15–3 target. This protein target was previously adsorbed on a gold (Au) support and incubated in charged monomers (4-Styrenesulfonate sodium and 3-Hydroxytyraminium chloride). The protein was further eliminated by enzymatic activity, leaving behind vacant sites for subsequent rebinding. Electrochemical detection (ii) was achieved on an Au working electrode, designed on commercial screen-printed electrodes. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and ellipsometric readings were used to follow the chemical modification of the Au surface. The ability of the material to rebind CA15-3 was monitored by electrochemical techniques. The device displayed linear responses to CA15-3 ranging from 0.25 to 10.00 U/mL, with detection limits of 0.05 U/mL. Accurate results were obtained by applying the sensor to the analysis of CA15-3 in PBS buffer and in serum samples. This biosensing device displayed successful features for the detection of CA 15–3 and constitutes a promising tool for breast cancer screening procedures in point-of-care applications. Moreover, its scale-up seems feasible as it contains a plastic antibody assembled &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, in less than 1 minute, and the analysis of serum takes less than 30 minutes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rui S.

I remember wondering what the chemical biology community would make out of these things, and I wanted to report on at least one ingenious answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general situation in the field is when you have a big pile of RNA or DNA pieces, and you want to analyze them – sort them out, determine how many different ones are in there and which ones are present more than the others. This is the underlying problem that “RNA-seq” assays are trying to answer: when you perturb some cells by changing something about their environment, what genes’ transcriptions get affected? What protein levels go up or down? One reasonable proxy for those is the levels of various mRNAs, but there’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of RNA in a cell, and sorting through it looking for changes has been nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some steps that a lot of these assays use to clean up the sample and get it into a form that can be more easily analyzed. The clean-up often involves some method to get all the ribosomal RNA out of there or to direct your readout away from it somehow, because that’s the majority of the RNA in cell lysate, and you don’t want your assay technology chasing it. Then there’s usually a fragmentation step, to break up the mRNAs into useful-sized pieces (which will be reassembled later on, computationally). Another common step is the use of reverse transcriptase enzymes to make complementary DNA out of all those mRNA pieces, because our techniques to amplify and sequence DNA are so flippin’ powerful. There’s often a step that tries to stick some sort of unique tag/label/identifier onto each DNA piece as well, using ligase enzymes, to aid in keeping track of all this stuff. These enzymes are the key to the whole business, along with modern sequencer technology and its associated computing prowess to reassemble everything from the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickSeq&quot;&gt;“Click-seq” variant&lt;/a&gt; works, though. You take your pile of mRNAs and expose them to reverse transcriptase, as before. But this time, you feed in a set amount of azide-containing nucleotides along with the usual mix of normal 2-deoxynucleotides to make your complementary DNAs. The thing is, these are chain-terminating residues for the RT enzyme, so what you end up with is a random heap of cDNA pieces, all of which end (on the 3′) with an azidonucleotide. And these turn into handles for introducing those labels/barcodes/identifiers. This way you avoid having to do a separate fragmentation step, because the reverse transcriptase has already fragmented things for you as it randomly choked on the azidonucleotides. And you avoid having to use the ligase enzymes to label everything, which can be expensive – you put those on via azide/alkyne reactions instead. The clicked oligos are still viable for PCR and sequencing, as it turns out, so that part of the process works fine, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7514-3_6&quot;&gt;the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; avoids some recombination artifacts that the other variants can be vulnerable to (ligases ligating the wrong things, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, it’s also good for picking up real recombination events that might be biologically relevant, but rare on the absolute scale. This happens with some viruses, and the technique &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006365&quot;&gt;has been used&lt;/a&gt; to look at so-called “defective interfering” RNAs which emerge over time in viral infections. These are somewhat mysterious – in some cases, they seem to hijack and (as the name says) perhaps interfere with the usual infectious cycle, but they may also prolong it and make it worse. It looks like some viruses have evolved to let these things accumulate, and there must be a reason for that, too. The only way to unravel all that is with a good enough RNA analysis technique, and the clicked nucleotides just may be providing one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/21/clicked-dna-from-lab-curiosity-to-analytical-technique</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><engagement>29</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13553</link><crawled>1526915728046</crawled><summary><content>I’ve written a few times about an odd sort of unnatural DNA sequence, where some of the nucleotides are connected via “click” triazole units rather than the traditional polyphosphate backbone.

To exploit the plethora of information provided by Next Generation Sequencing, the identification of the genetic mutations responsible for disease in general or cancer in particular, among the thousands of neutral germline or somatic variations is a crucial task. Genome-wide association studies for the detection of disease-associated genes or cancer drivers can only identify common variations or driver genes in a cohort of patients. Thus, they cannot discover unique disease-associated mutations or cancer driver genes on a personal basis. Moreover, even when there are such common variations, their significance is unknown. Here, we extend the machine learning based approach ENTPRISE developed for predicting the disease association of missense mutations to frameshift and nonsense mutations. The new approach, ENTPRISE-X, is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods VEST-indel and DDIG-in for predicting the disease association of germline frameshift mutations in terms of balanced measure Matthew’s correlation coefficient, MCC, with a MCC of 0.586 for ENTPRISE-X, versus 0.412 by VEST-indel and 0.321 by DDIG-in, respectively. Large scale testing on the ExAC dataset shows ENTPRISE-X has a much lower fraction of 16% of variations classified as disease causing, as compared to VEST-indel’s 26% and DDIG-in’s 65% of predictions as being disease-associated.

Hypoxia-mediated pancreatic beta cell death is one of the main causes of pancreatic beta celldeath, which leads to the loss of functional pancreatic beta cell mass and type 1 diabetes andtype 2 diabetes.However, the molecular mechanisms that control life and death of pancreatic beta cells remain poorly understood. Here we showed that mitochondrial fission was strongly induced in pancreatic beta cellsmainly due to an elevation of DRP1&lt;sup&gt;S616&lt;/sup&gt; phosphorylation through HIF-1αactivation and subsequent DRP1 mitochondrial translocation. Hypoxia-induced pancreatic beta cell death can be reversed by the inhibition of mitochondrial fission viaDRP1 knockdown. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission untightened the cristae formation, which subsequently triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and consequent caspase activation. Moreover, treatment with mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1), a specific inhibitor of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, significantly suppressedbeta cell death in vitro, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes.Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in hypoxia-induced beta cell death, which provides a strong evidence for thisprocess as drug target indiabetestreatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Da Zhang, Yanfang Liu, Yao Tang, Xiaofeng Wang, Zhichao Li, Rui Li, Zhenyu Ti, Weidong Gao, Jigang Bai, Yi Lv&lt;/p&gt;

The HIV-1 nucleocapsid 7 (NCp7) plays crucial roles in multiple stages of HIV-1 life cycle, and its biological functions rely on the binding of zinc ions. Understanding the molecular mechanism of how the zinc ions modulate the conformational dynamics and functions of the NCp7 is essential for the drug development and HIV-1 treatment. In this work, using a structure-based coarse-grained model, we studied the effects of zinc cofactors on the folding and target RNA(SL3) recognition of the NCp7 by molecular dynamics simulations. After reproducing some key properties of the zinc binding and folding of the NCp7 observed in previous experiments, our simulations revealed several interesting features in the metal ion modulated folding and target recognition. Firstly, we showed that the zinc binding makes the folding transition states of the two zinc fingers less structured, which is in line with the Hammond effect observed typically in mutation, temperature or denaturant induced perturbations to protein structure and stability. Secondly, We showed that there exists mutual interplay between the zinc ion binding and NCp7-target recognition. Binding of zinc ions enhances the affinity between the NCp7 and the target RNA, whereas the formation of the NCp7-RNA complex reshapes the intrinsic energy landscape of the NCp7 and increases the stability and zinc affinity of the two zinc fingers. Thirdly, by characterizing the effects of salt concentrations on the target RNA recognition, we showed that the NCp7 achieves optimal balance between the affinity and binding kinetics near the physiologically relevant salt concentrations.

The HIV-1 nucleocapsid 7 (NCp7) plays crucial roles in multiple stages of HIV-1 life cycle, and its biological functions rely on the binding of zinc ions. Understanding the molecular mechanism of how the zinc ions modulate the conformational dynamics and functions of the NCp7 is essential for the drug development and HIV-1 treatment. In this work, using a structure-based coarse-grained model, we studied the effects of zinc cofactors on the folding and target RNA(SL3) recognition of the NCp7 by molecular dynamics simulations.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. An imbalance in the differentiation of these lineages could affect the preservation of bone integrity. Several studies have suggested the importance of this imbalance in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis after kidney transplant (KT), but the role of bone marrow adiposity in this process is not well known, and if the treatment with the anti-absorptive (zoledronic acid-ZA) drugs could attenuate bone loss. Thus, our objective was compare bone marrow adiposity, osteoblasts and osteocytes before and after KT, verify an association between bone remodeling process (Turnover, Volume, and Mineralization—TMV classification), the osteocyte sclerostin expression to evaluate if there is a role of Wnt pathway, as well as the effect of ZA on these cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 29 new living-donor KT patients. One group received ZA at the time of KT plus cholecalciferol for twelve months, and the other group received only cholecalciferol. Bone biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed in bone and bone marrow adipocytes. Sclerostin (Scl) expression in osteocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Some bone marrow adiposity parameters were increased before KT. After KT, some of them remained increased and they worsened with the use of ZA. In the baseline, lower bone Volume and Turnover, were associated with increased bone marrow adiposity parameters (some of them). After KT, both groups showed the same associations. Osteocyte Scl expression after KT decreased with the use of ZA. We observed also an inverse association between bone adiposity parameters and lower osteocyte sclerostin expression 12 months after KT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the present study suggests that KT fails to normalize bone marrow adiposity, and it even gets worse with the use of ZA. Moreover, bone marrow adiposity is inversely associated with bone Volume and Turnover, which seems to be accentuated by the antiresorptive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mariel J.

Background &lt;p&gt;No evidence-based therapy exists for non-arteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO). Retinal ischemic tolerance is low; irreversible damage occurs within four hours of experimental NA-CRAO. In previous randomized trials evaluating intra-arterial or intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in NA-CRAO, only one patient was treated this early. In December 2013, the Departments of Neurology &amp;amp; Stroke and Ophthalmology at University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany, decided to treat patients using IVT within 4.5 hours of NA-CRAO, the therapeutic window established for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive NA-CRAO patients with severe visual loss received IVT after exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up was conducted at day 5 (d5) and day 30 (d30). Visual outcomes were compared to the conservative standard treatment (CST) arm of the EAGLE-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Until August 2016, 20 patients received IVT within 4.5 hours after NA-CRAO with a median onset-to-treatment time of 210 minutes (IQR 120–240). Visual acuity improved from baseline mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 2.46±0.33 (SD) (light perception) to 1.52±1.09 (Snellen equivalent: 6/200) at d5 (p = 0.002) and 1.60±1.08 (Snellen equivalent: 6/240) at d30. Compared to the EAGLE CST-arm, functional recovery to reading ability occurred more frequently after IVT: 6/20 (30%) versus 1/39 (3%) at d5 (p = 0.005) and at d30 5/20 (25%) versus 2/37 (5%) (p = 0.045). Two patients experienced serious adverse events (one angioedema and one bleeding from an abdominal aortic aneurysm) but recovered without sequelae.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IVT within 4.5 hours after symptom onset may represent an effective treatment of NA-CRAO.

In analysis of methylation profiles and genotypic data, they provided new insights on the molecular basis on diseases and adaptation of humans to their environment.

S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by De Chen, Linjie Luo, Chao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atiq Hassan, Breanna M.

AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Acute intermittent hypoxia and rehabilitative training following cervical spinal injury alters neuronal hypoxia- and plasticity-associated protein expression</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</link><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7222:2835af05</id><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34702</originId><fingerprint>7ba7ff24</fingerprint><keywords><item>Plant Biology</item></keywords><author><name>jn7@uw.edu (Alexander R Leydon)</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34702</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><content>Developmental programs sculpt plant morphology to meet environmental challenges, and these same programs have been manipulated to increase agricultural productivity&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The transcriptional network and protein regulators that govern T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation have been studied extensively using advanced genomic approaches. For a better understanding of these biological processes, we have moved a step forward, from gene- to protein-level characterization of Th17 cells. Mass spectrometry–based label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics analysis were made of in vitro differentiated murine Th17 and induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells. More than 4,000 proteins, covering almost all subcellular compartments, were detected. Quantitative comparison of the protein expression profiles resulted in the identification of proteins specifically expressed in the Th17 and iTreg cells. Importantly, our combined analysis of proteome and gene expression data revealed protein expression changes that were not associated with changes at the transcriptional level. Our dataset provides a valuable resource, with new insights into the proteomic characteristics of Th17 and iTreg cells, which may prove useful in developing treatment of autoimmune diseases and developing tumor immunotherapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3TAHD3yxTS4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Imran Mohammad, Kari Nousiainen, Santosh D.

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan K.

These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Optic tract injury after closed head traumatic brain injury in mice: A model of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559161:93d646dc</id><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00144</originId><fingerprint>368de20a</fingerprint><author><name>Yeongjoon Lee, Chulhee Kwak, Ki-Woong Jeong, Prasannavenkatesh Durai, Kyoung-Seok Ryu, Eun-Hee Kim, Chaejoon Cheong, Hee-Chul Ahn, Hak Jun Kim, Yangmee Kim</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/26p0wViYm1g/acs.biochem.8b00144</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00144/20180518/images/medium/bi-2018-00144g_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00144&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In the traditional two-step procedure used in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, fluence map optimization (FMO) is performed first, followed by use of a leaf sequencing algorithm (LSA). By contrast, direct aperture optimization (DAO) directly optimizes aperture leaf positions and weights. However, dose calculation using the Monte Carlo (MC) method for DAO is often time-consuming. Therefore, a rapid DAO (RDAO) algorithm is proposed that uses a dose influence matrix based piecewise aperture dose model (DIM-PADM). In the proposed RDAO algorithm, dose calculation is based on the dose influence matrix instead of MC. The dose dependence of aperture leafs is modeled as a piecewise function using the DIM. The corresponding DIM-PADM-based DAO problem is solved using a simulated annealing algorithm.The proposed algorithm was validated through application to TG119, prostate, liver, and head and neck (H&amp;amp;N) cases from the common optimization for radiation therapy dataset. Compared with the two-step FMO–LSA procedure, the proposed algorithm resulted in more precise dose conformality in all four cases. Specifically, for the H&amp;amp;N dataset, the cost value for the planned target volume (PTV) was decreased by 32%, whereas the cost value for the two organs at risk (OARs) was decreased by 60% and 92%. Our study of the proposed novel DIM-PADM-based RDAO algorithm makes two main contributions: First, we validate the use of the proposed algorithm, in contrast to the FMO–LSA framework, for direct optimization of aperture leaf positions and show that this method results in more precise dose conformality. Second, we demonstrate that compared to MC, the DIM-PADM-based method significantly reduces the computational time required for DAO.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuejiao Zeng, Hao Gao, Xunbin Wei&lt;/p&gt;

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective way to lose weight and reverse type 2 diabetes. We profiled the metabolome of 18 obese patients (nine euglycemic and nine diabetics) that underwent RYGB surgery and seven lean subjects. Plasma samples from the obese patients were collected before the surgery and one week and three months after the surgery. We analyzed the metabolome in association to five hormones (Adiponectin, Insulin, Ghrelin, Leptin, and Resistin), four peptide hormones (GIP, Glucagon, GLP1, and PYY), and two cytokines (IL-6 and TNF). PCA showed samples cluster by surgery time and many microbially driven metabolites (indoles in particular) correlated with the three months after the surgery. Network analysis of metabolites revealed a connection between carbohydrate (mannosamine and glucosamine) and glyoxylate and confirms glyoxylate association to diabetes. Only leptin and IL-6 had a significant association with the measured metabolites. Leptin decreased immediately after RYGB (before significant weight loss), whereas IL-6 showed no consistent response to RYGB. Moreover, leptin associated with tryptophan in support of the possible role of leptin in the regulation of serotonin synthesis pathways in the gut. These results suggest a potential link between gastric leptin and microbial-derived metabolites in the context of obesity and diabetes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Loqmane Seridi, Gregory C.

Taken together, we provided a systematic approach to define a more accurate gene essentiality profile by integrating functional screen data and molecular profiles.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322883v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1526402649199</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/322883</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16364b00c6f:39bf34c:93d646dc</id><published>1526367600000</published><title>Improving the consistency of functional genomics screens using molecular features - a multi-omics, pan-cancer study [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/698?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>29af1ab9</fingerprint><keywords><item>Astronomy, Planetary Science</item></keywords><author><name>Clery, D.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/698?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/698.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/698?rss=1</link><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395db:3dd877af</id><published>1526578752000</published><title>China&apos;s moon mission is set to probe cosmic dark ages</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197858</originId><fingerprint>5bd78037</fingerprint><author><name>Preeti Jaggi</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197858</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Preeti Jaggi, Asuncion Mejias, Zhaohui Xu, Han Yin, Melissa Moore-Clingenpeel, Bennett Smith, Jane C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Early identification of children with Kawasaki Disease (KD) is key for timely initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. However, the diagnosis of the disease remains challenging, especially in children with an incomplete presentation (inKD). Moreover, we currently lack objective tools for identification of non-response (NR) to IVIG.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Children with KD were enrolled and samples obtained before IVIG treatment and sequentially at 24 h and 4–6 weeks post-IVIG in a subset of patients. We also enrolled children with other febrile illnesses [adenovirus (AdV); group A streptococcus (GAS)] and healthy controls (HC) for comparative analyses. Blood transcriptional profiles were analyzed to define: a) the cKD and inKD biosignature, b) compare the KD signature with other febrile illnesses and, c) identify biomarkers predictive of clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified a cKD biosignature (n = 39; HC, n = 16) that was validated in two additional cohorts of children with cKD (n = 37; HC, n = 20) and inKD (n = 13; HC, n = 8) and was characterized by overexpression of inflammation, platelets, apoptosis and neutrophil genes, and underexpression of T and NK cell genes. Classifier genes discriminated KD from adenovirus with higher sensitivity and specificity (92% and 100%, respectively) than for GAS (75% and 87%, respectively). We identified a genomic score (MDTH) that was higher at baseline in IVIG-NR [median 12,290 vs. 5,572 in responders, p = 0.009] and independently predicted IVIG-NR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A reproducible biosignature from KD patients was identified, and was similar in children with cKD and inKD.

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main products of indigestible carbohydrates that are fermented by microbiota in the hindgut. This study was designed to investigate the effects of oral SCFAs administration on the lipid metabolism of weaned pigs. A total of 21 barrows were randomly allocated into three groups, including control group (orally infused with 200 mL physiological saline per day), low dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 20.04 mM, propionic acid 7.71 mM and butyric acid 4.89 mM per day), and high dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 40.08 mM, propionic acid 15.42 mM and butyric acid 9.78 mM per day). The results showed that the average daily feed intake of SCFAs groups were lower than that of control group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Oral administration of SCFAs decreased the concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and insulin (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased the leptin concentration in serum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). The total fat, as well as TC and TG levels in liver, was decreased by oral SCFAs administration (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, SCFAs down-regulated the mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and enhanced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α) in liver (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). SCFAs also decreased FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor σ mRNA expressions in longissimus dorsi (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). And in abdominal fat, SCFAs reduced FAS and ACC mRNA expressions (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased CPT-1α mRNA expression (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05).

Group B &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GBS) carriage by pregnant women is the primary risk factor for early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent this transmission route, and two main approaches are recommended to base the selection of pregnant women to be submitted to IAP: the risk-based and the culture-based strategies. In Brazil, compliance to such recommendations is poor, and not much is known about GBS carriage. In the present study, 3,647 pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were screened for GBS anogenital colonization, over a period of 8 years (2008–2015). GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Caroline N.

Loss or gain of copy number of the gene encoding the transcription factor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (Rett and MeCP2 duplication syndrome), indicating that precisely regulated MeCP2 expression during development is critical for mental health. Consistent with this idea, MeCP2 null mutants exhibit synaptic regression in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual relay center in the thalamus, a phenotype resembling that of animals reared in the dark during the visual sensitive period. It remains unclear how MeCP2 expression is regulated during circuit formation and maturation, especially in excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons. We found that, concomitant with the initiation of the dark-rearing sensitive period, MeCP2 protein levels were elevated in glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons of the dLGN. Moreover, MeCP2 expression in glutamatergic populations was selectively reduced by dark-rearing. Therefore, we propose that visual experience–dependent MeCP2 induction in glutamatergic populations is essential for synaptic maturation within the dLGN.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Yagasaki, Goichi Miyoshi, Mariko Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, we propose that visual experience–dependent MeCP2 induction in glutamatergic populations is essential for synaptic maturation within the dLGN.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Experience-dependent MeCP2 expression in the excitatory cells of mouse visual thalamus</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198268</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198268</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb928:3dd877af</id><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0068-9</originId><fingerprint>f9e69b0e</fingerprint><author><name>Cliona Rooney</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/OPWakSxFvsI/s41591-018-0068-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modeling cytokine release syndrome&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling cytokine release syndrome, Published online: 28 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0068-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0068-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Complete leukemic responses to chimeric antigen receptor–modified T cells are invariably accompanied by severe toxicity.

The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ruben D.

By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained. To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated. Given the complexity of the signaling pathways already known, the question arises of ascertaining whether such complexity is an inherent requirement of the process, or a consequence of operational redundancy. In this work we propose a minimal model of BMU function which involves a small number of signals and accounts for fully functional BMU operation. Our main assumptions are i) at any given time, any cell within a BMU can select only one among a reduced choice of decisions: divide, die, migrate or differentiate, ii) such decision is irreversibly determined by depletion of an appropriate internal inhibitor and iii) the dynamics of any such inhibitor is coupled to that of a few external mediators. It is shown that efficient BMU operation then unfolds as an emergent property, which results from individual decisions taken by cells in the BMU unit in the absence of any external planning.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>Human skeleton undergoes constant remodeling during the whole life. By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained.

In long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most studied types of neural plasticity, synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to stimulation. Although a number of different proteins have been implicated in the sub-cellular molecular processes underlying induction and maintenance of LTP, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A particular challenge is to demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans. Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one involving the atypical protein kinase PKMζ and its messenger RNA, the other involving PKMζ and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate that robust bistability–stable equilibria both in the synapse’s potentiated and unpotentiated states–can arise from a set of simple molecular reactions. The model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation and the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_PVuKNJRBs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Helfer, Thomas R.

The link between athlete physique and performance in sports is well established. However, a direct link between somatotype three-numeral rating and anaerobic performance has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the relations between somatotype and anaerobic performance using both singular and multivariate analyses. Thirty-six physically active males (mean ± standard deviation age 26.0 ± 9.8 years; body mass 79.5 ± 12.9 kg; height 1.82 ± 0.07 m) were somatotype-rated using the Heath-Carter method. Subjects were assessed for 3 repetition maximum (3 RM) bench press and back squat, and completed a 30-second maximal sprint cycle test. Positive correlations were observed between mesomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = 0.560, p &amp;lt; 0.001), mesomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = 0.550, p = 0.001) and between mesomorphy and minimum power output (r = 0.357, p = 0.033). Negative correlations were observed between ectomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = -0.381, p = 0.022), and ectomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = -0.336, p = 0.045). Individual regression analysis indicated that mesomorphy was the best predictor of 3 RM bench press performance, with 31.4% of variance in 3 RM bench press performance accounted for by the mesomorphy rating (p &amp;lt; 0.001). A combination of mesomorphy and ectomorphy best predicted 3 RM back squat performance (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.388, p &amp;lt; 0.04). Around one third of strength performance is predicted by somatotype-assessed physique in physically active males. This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Helen Ryan-Stewart, James Faulkner, Simon Jobson&lt;/p&gt;

This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes.</description><unread>True</unread><title>The influence of somatotype on anaerobic performance</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197761</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197761</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094068:2835af05</id><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6</originId><fingerprint>6b8208de</fingerprint><author><name>Giorgia Guglielmi</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05161-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Gene collections and astronomy studies dominate the list of the most-cited publications with DOIs on the popular online encyclopaedia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05161-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Gene collections and astronomy studies dominate the list of the most-cited publications with DOIs on the popular online encyclopaedia.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>106</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6</link><crawled>1526306878081</crawled><visual><height>576</height><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05161-6/d41586-018-05161-6_15756208.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1635efab281:30e373d:2835af05</id><published>1526281200000</published><title>Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006142</originId><fingerprint>826b388</fingerprint><author><name>Andrew D.

Target selection is the first and pivotal step in drug discovery. An incorrect choice may not manifest itself for many years after hundreds of millions of research dollars have been spent. We collected a set of 332 targets that succeeded or failed in phase III clinical trials, and explored whether Omic features describing the target genes could predict clinical success. We obtained features from the recently published comprehensive resource: Harmonizome. Nineteen features appeared to be significantly correlated with phase III clinical trial outcomes, but only 4 passed validation schemes that used bootstrapping or modified permutation tests to assess feature robustness and generalizability while accounting for target class selection bias. We also used classifiers to perform multivariate feature selection and found that classifiers with a single feature performed as well in cross-validation as classifiers with more features (AUROC = 0.57 and AUPR = 0.81). The two predominantly selected features were mean mRNA expression across tissues and standard deviation of expression across tissues, where successful targets tended to have lower mean expression and higher expression variance than failed targets. This finding supports the conventional wisdom that it is favorable for a target to be present in the tissue(s) affected by a disease and absent from other tissues. Overall, our results suggest that it is feasible to construct a model integrating interpretable target features to inform target selection. We anticipate deeper insights and better models in the future, as researchers can reuse the data we have provided to improve methods for handling sample biases and learn more informative features. Code, documentation, and data for this study have been deposited on GitHub at https://github.com/arouillard/omic-features-successful-targets.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vNbdSy5pqZY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew D.

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

Two-pore domain K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt;) are responsible for background K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents and regulate the resting membrane potential and cellular excitability. Their activity is controlled by a large variety of physicochemical factors and intracellular signaling pathways. The majority of these effects converge on the intracellular C-terminus of the channels, resulting in the modification of the gating at the selectivity filter. Another gating mechanism, the activation gate at the helix bundle crossing is also well documented in other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel families, however, it remains uncertain whether this type of gating is functional in K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. The regulation of TWIK-related spinal cord K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (TRESK) is different from the other K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. Regulatory factors acting via the C-terminus are not known, instead channel activity is modified by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the unusually long intracellular loop between the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; transmembrane segments.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christi Patten, James Levine, Ioannis Pavlidis, Joyce Balls-Berry, Arya Shah, Christine Hughes, Tabetha Brockman, Miguel Valdez Soto, Daniel Witt, Gabriel Koepp, Pamela Sinicrope, Jamie Richards&lt;/p&gt;

Genome-scale metabolic models have become the tool of choice for the global analysis of microorganism metabolism, and their reconstruction has attained high standards of quality and reliability. Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “à la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV3GF0mvv-g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Méziane Aite, Marie Chevallier, Clémence Frioux, Camille Trottier, Jeanne Got, María Paz Cortés, Sebastián N.

Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E.

Q fever vaccine uptake among veterinary nurses in Australia is low, suggesting veterinarians are not recommending the vaccination to veterinary personnel. This study aimed to determine the willingness of veterinarians to recommend Q fever vaccination to veterinary personnel and to identify factors influencing Q fever vaccine uptake by veterinary nurses in Australia. An online cross sectional survey targeted veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia in 2014. Responses were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Factors significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with a willingness to recommend the vaccination, expressed by 35% (95% CI 31–38%) of veterinarians (n = 828), were (1) being very concerned for colleagues regarding &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; (OR 4.73), (2) disagreeing the vaccine is harmful (OR 3.80), (3) high Q fever knowledge (OR 2.27), (4) working within small animal practice (OR 1.67), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.55), and (6) age, with veterinarians under 39 years most likely to recommend vaccination. Of the veterinary nursing cohort who reported a known Q fever vaccination status (n = 688), 29% (95% CI 26–33%) had sought vaccination. This was significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) associated with (1) agreeing the vaccine is important (OR 8.34), (2) moderate/high Q fever knowledge (OR 5.51), (3) working in Queensland (OR 4.00), (4) working within livestock/mixed animal practice (OR 3.24), (5) disagreeing the vaccine is expensive (OR 1.86), (6) strong reliance on work culture for biosecurity information (OR 2.5), (7) perceiving personal exposure to &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt; to be at least low/moderate (OR 2.14), and (8) both agreeing the vaccine is safe and working within a corporate practice structure (OR 4.28). The study identified the need for veterinarians to take greater responsibility for workplace health and safety promotion, and calls for better education of veterinary personnel to raise awareness of the potential for occupational exposure to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burnetii&lt;/i&gt; and improve the perception of the Q fever vaccine as being important, safe and cost-effective.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emily Sellens, Jacqueline M.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and irreversible scarring disease in the lung with poor prognosis. Few therapies are available; therefore it is critical to identify new therapeutic targets. Our lab has previously identified the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) as a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis. We found increases in LDHA protein and its metabolic product, lactate, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Importantly, we described lactate as a novel pro-fibrotic mediator by acidifying the extracellular space, and activating latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) in a pH-dependent manner. We propose a pro-fibrotic feed-forward loop by which LDHA produces lactate, lactate decreases pH in the extracellular space and activates TGF-β1 which can further perpetuate fibrotic signaling. Our previous work also demonstrates that the LDHA inhibitor gossypol inhibits TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we employed a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis to test whether gossypol inhibits pulmonary fibrosis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that gossypol dose-dependently inhibits bleomycin-induced collagen accumulation and TGF-β1 activation in mouse lungs when treatment is started on the same day as bleomycin administration. Importantly, gossypol was also effective at treating collagen accumulation when delayed 7 days following bleomycin. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of LDHA with the inhibitor gossypol is effective at both preventing and treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and suggests that LDHA may be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cigarette smoking by pregnant women is associated with a significant increase in the risk for cognitive disorders in their children. Preclinical models confirm this risk by showing that exposure of the developing brain to nicotine produces adverse behavioral outcomes. Here we describe behavioral phenotypes resulting from perinatal nicotine exposure in a mouse model, and discuss our findings in the context of findings from previously published studies using preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Female C57Bl/6 mice received drinking water containing nicotine (100μg/ml) + saccharin (2%) starting 3 weeks prior to breeding and continuing throughout pregnancy, and until 3 weeks postpartum. Over the same period, female mice in two control groups received drinking water containing saccharin (2%) or plain drinking water. Offspring from each group were weaned at 3-weeks of age and subjected to behavioral analyses at 3 months of age. We examined spontaneous locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, spatial working memory, object based attention, recognition memory and impulsive-like behavior. We found significant deficits in attention and working memory only in male mice, and no significant changes in the other behavioral phenotypes in male or female mice. Exposure to saccharin alone did not produce significant changes in either sex.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion/Significance &lt;p&gt;The perinatal nicotine exposure produced significant deficits in attention and working memory in a sex-dependent manner in that the male but not female offspring displayed these behaviors. These behavioral phenotypes are associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and have been reported in other studies that used pre- or perinatal nicotine exposure. Therefore, we suggest that preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure could be useful tools for modeling ADHD and related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin Zhang, Thomas J.

Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beau Oldenburg, Marijtje Van Duijn, René Veenstra&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Up to 25% of acute stroke patients first note symptoms upon awakening. We hypothesized that patients awaking with stroke symptoms may be safely treated with intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) using non-contrast head CT (NCHCT), if they meet all other standard criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The SAfety of Intravenous thromboLytics in stroke ON awakening (SAIL ON) was a prospective, open-label, single treatment arm, pilot safety trial of standard dose IV tPA in patients who presented with stroke symptoms within 0–4.5 hours of awakening. From January 30, 2013, to September 1, 2015, twenty consecutive wakeup stroke patients selected by NCHCT were enrolled. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in the first 36 hours. Secondary outcomes included NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours; and modified Rankin Score (mRS), NIHSS, and Barthel index at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The average age was 65 years (range 47–83); 40% were women; 50% were African American. The average NIHSS was 6 (range 4–11). The average time from wake-up to IV tPA was 205 minutes (range 114–270). The average time from last known well to IV tPA was 580 minutes (range 353–876). The median mRS at 90 days was 1 (range 0–5). No patients had sICH; two of 20 (10%) had asymptomatic ICH on routine post IV tPA brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Administration of IV tPA was feasible and may be safe in wakeup stroke patients presenting within 4.5 hours from awakening, screened with NCHCT.

Background &lt;p&gt;There is evidence that maternal genotypes in folate-related genes are associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) independent of offspring genotype. We evaluated the relationship between maternal genotypes in methionine synthase (&lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;) and DNA methylation status in ALL to better characterize the molecular mechanism underlying this association.&lt;/p&gt; Procedure &lt;p&gt;We obtained bone marrow samples from 51 patients with ALL at diagnosis and from 6 healthy donors. Mothers of patients provided a saliva sample and were genotyped at 11 tagSNPs in &lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;. DNA methylation was measured in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients and six healthy marrow donors. We used hierarchical clustering to identify patients with a hypermethylator phenotype based on 281 differentially methylated promoter CpGs. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of maternal genotype on the likelihood of DNA hypermethylation in ALL and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify networks enriched for differentially methylated genes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-two cases (43%) demonstrated promoter hypermethylation, which was more frequent among those with &lt;i&gt;ETV6-RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; fusion and initial white blood cell count &amp;lt; 50 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L. Maternal rs12759827 was associated with aberrant DNA methylation (odds ratio [OR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval 1.46–16.31); non-significantly elevated ORs were observed for all other SNPs. Aberrantly methylated promoter CpGs aligned to genes with known cancer-related functions.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Maternal folate metabolic genotype may be associated with DNA methylation patterns in ALL in their offspring. Therefore, the effect of maternal genotypes on ALL susceptibility may act through aberrant promoter methylation, which may contribute to the &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; origins of ALL.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeremy M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Dengue outbreaks are increasing in frequency over space and time, affecting people’s health and burdening resource-constrained health systems. The ability to detect early emerging outbreaks is key to mounting an effective response. The early warning and response system (EWARS) is a toolkit that provides countries with early-warning systems for efficient and cost-effective local responses. EWARS uses outbreak and alarm indicators to derive prediction models that can be used prospectively to predict a forthcoming dengue outbreak at district level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We report on the development of the EWARS tool, based on users’ recommendations into a convenient, user-friendly and reliable software aided by a user’s workbook and its field testing in 30 health districts in Brazil, Malaysia and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;34 Health officers from the 30 study districts who had used the original EWARS for 7 to 10 months responded to a questionnaire with mainly open-ended questions. Qualitative content analysis showed that participants were generally satisfied with the tool but preferred open-access vs. commercial software. EWARS users also stated that the geographical unit should be the district, while access to meteorological information should be improved. These recommendations were incorporated into the second-generation EWARS-R, using the free R software, combined with recent surveillance data and resulted in higher sensitivities and positive predictive values of alarm signals compared to the first-generation EWARS. Currently the use of satellite data for meteorological information is being tested and a dashboard is being developed to increase user-friendliness of the tool. The inclusion of other &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; borne viral diseases is under discussion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;EWARS is a pragmatic and useful tool for detecting imminent dengue outbreaks to trigger early response activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laith Hussain-Alkhateeb, Axel Kroeger, Piero Olliaro, Joacim Rocklöv, Maquins Odhiambo Sewe, Gustavo Tejeda, David Benitez, Balvinder Gill, S.

Secreted Nano-luciferase (secNluc) is a newly engineered secreted luciferase that possesses advantages of high structural stability, long half-life, and glow-type kinetics together with high light emission intensity, and thus would become one of the most valuable tools for bioluminescence assays. However, like other secreted luciferases, secNluc has to mix with the components in the conditioned medium surrounding test cells, or in the biological samples such as blood or urine after being secreted. These components may interfere with secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions and thus limit the application of the secNluc reporter system. In this study, we first examined the effects of three factors, pH, serum and residual reagents, on secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions, finding that these factors could interfere with bioluminescence reactions and result in background signal. To resolve these problems, we applied a simple affinity purification strategy in which secNluc was fused with a FLAG-tag, and anti-FLAG magnetic beads were used to catch and transfer the fusion protein to PBST, an optimal buffer for secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions that was identified in this study. The results indicated that this strategy could not only negate the interferences from serum or residual reagents and enhance the stability of light emission but also greatly increase signal intensity through enzyme enrichment. This strategy may contribute to biomedical studies that utilize secNluc and other secreted luciferases, especially those requiring superior sensitivity, low background noise and high reproducibility.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by JingZhe Li, ZhiLan Guo, Takashi Sato, Bo Yuan, YanYan Ma, Dan Qian, JuYing Zhong, MengMeng Jin, Peng Huang, LuYang Che, Yi Wang, Yan Lei, ChangZhen Liu&lt;/p&gt;

The widespread use of social media has created a valuable but underused source of data for the environmental sciences. We demonstrate the potential for images posted to the website Twitter to capture variability in vegetation phenology across United States National Parks. We process a subset of images posted to Twitter within eight U.S. National Parks, with the aim of understanding the amount of green vegetation in each image. Analysis of the relative greenness of the images show statistically significant seasonal cycles across most National Parks at the 95% confidence level, consistent with springtime green-up and fall senescence. Additionally, these social media-derived greenness indices correlate with monthly mean satellite NDVI (r = 0.62), reinforcing the potential value these data could provide in constraining models and observing regions with limited high quality scientific monitoring.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sam J.

Fitness is determined by the ability of an organism to both survive and reproduce; however, the mechanisms that lead to increased survival may not have the same effect on reproductive success. We used nineteen natural &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; genotypes from the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Genetic Reference Panel to determine if adaptive plasticity following short-term acclimation through rapid cold-hardening (RCH) affects mating behavior and mating success. We confirmed that exposure to the acclimation temperature is beneficial to survival following cold stress; however, we found that this same acclimation temperature exposure led to less efficient male courtship and a significant decrease in the likelihood of mating. Cold tolerance and the capacity to respond plastically to cold stress were not correlated with mating behavior following acclimation, suggesting that the genetic control of the physiological effects of the cold temperature exposure likely differ between survival and behavioral responses. We also tested whether the exposure of males to the acclimation temperature influenced courtship song. This exposure again significantly increased courtship duration; however, courtship song was unchanged. These results illustrate costs of short-term acclimation on survival and reproductive components of fitness and demonstrate the pronounced effect that short-term thermal environment shifts can have on reproductive success.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth R.

This study investigated &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; expression in the &lt;i&gt;pars tuberalis&lt;/i&gt; (PT) of the pituitary and medio-basal hypothalamus (MBH) of sheep, across seasons and reproductive states. It has recently been proposed that season impacts alternative splicing of &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in the PT, which shifts the balance between angiogenic VEGFAxxx and anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms (with xxx the number of amino acids of the mature VEGFA proteins) to modulate seasonal breeding. Here, we used various RT-PCR methodologies and analysis of RNAseq datasets to investigate seasonal variation in expression and splicing of the ovine &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; gene. Collectively, we identify 5 different transcripts for &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; within the ewe PT/MBH, which correspond to splicing events previously described in mouse and human. All identified transcripts encode angiogenic VEGFAxxx isoforms, with no evidence for alternative splicing within exon 8. These findings led us to investigate in detail how “&lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt;-like” PCR products could be generated by RT-PCR and misidentified as endogenous transcripts, in sheep and human HEK293 cells. In conclusion, our findings do not support the existence of anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms in the ovine PT/MBH and shed new light on the interpretation of prior studies, which claimed to identify &lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt; isoforms by RT-PCR.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Didier Lomet, Benoît Piégu, Shona H.

Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the “emerging” mycotoxins, which are produced by various &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1.

Together, our data demonstrate that a recessive germline mutation in &lt;i&gt;CAMK2A&lt;/i&gt; leads to neurodevelopmental defects in humans and suggest that dysfunctional CAMK2 paralogs may contribute to other neurological disorders.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>61</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32451</link><crawled>1526972734390</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32451</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16386aadbb6:6b41130:93d646dc</id><published>1526947200000</published><title>A homozygous loss-of-function CAMK2A mutation causes growth delay, frequent seizures and severe intellectual disability</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323576v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>f461ed71</fingerprint><author><name>Johnson, L.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise training with modest or greater weight loss (≥3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) on insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein concentrations, and lipoprotein particle size in overweight and obese participants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Adults (N = 163, body mass index: 25–37 [kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]) participated in 8 months of exercise training. Insulin sensitivity, lipid concentrations, lipid particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) following the intervention.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute insulin response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p&amp;lt;0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional lipid risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size). Clinicians should advocate patients who are overweight/obese to exercise and obtain modest weight loss for improved cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Damon L.

To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282269v3?rss=1</link><crawled>1527101391442</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/282269</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1638e560252:795eca9:2835af05</id><published>1527058800000</published><title>A Bayesian Mixture Modelling Approach For Spatial Proteomics [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/eaat9922?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>703a8ed5</fingerprint><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/eaat9922?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/eaat9922?rss=1</link><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/eaat9922.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33b71:3dd877af</id><published>1525369184000</published><title>Erratum for the Report &quot;Translocation of a gut pathobiont drives autoimmunity in mice and humans&quot; by S.

Aiming at the design of an allosteric modulator of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)–Immunoglobulin G (IgG) interaction, we developed a new methodology including NMR fragment screening, X-ray crystallography, and magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR at 100 kHz after sedimentation, exploiting very fast spinning of the nondeuterated soluble 42 kDa receptor construct to obtain resolved proton-detected 2D and 3D NMR spectra. FcRn plays a crucial role in regulation of IgG and serum albumin catabolism. It is a clinically validated drug target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases caused by pathogenic antibodies via the inhibition of its interaction with IgG. We herein present the discovery of a small molecule that binds into a conserved cavity of the heterodimeric, extracellular domain composed of an α-chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m) (FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt;, 373 residues). X-ray crystallography was used alongside NMR at 100 kHz MAS with sedimented soluble protein to explore possibilities for refining the compound as an allosteric modulator. Proton-detected MAS NMR experiments on fully protonated [&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C,&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]-labeled FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt; yielded ligand-induced chemical-shift perturbations (CSPs) for residues in the binding pocket and allosteric changes close to the interface of the two receptor heterodimers present in the asymmetric unit as well as potentially in the albumin interaction site. X-ray structures with and without ligand suggest the need for an optimized ligand to displace the α-chain with respect to β2m, both of which participate in the FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt;–IgG interaction site. Our investigation establishes a method to characterize structurally small molecule binding to nondeuterated large proteins by NMR, even in their glycosylated form, which may prove highly valuable for structure-based drug discovery campaigns.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S9m_cYKMaok&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Stöppler, Alex Macpherson, Susanne Smith-Penzel, Nicolas Basse, Fabien Lecomte, Hervé Deboves, Richard D.

Thirty-eight percent of US adult women are obese, meaning that more children are now born of overweight and obese mothers, leading to an increase in predisposition to several adult onset diseases. To explore this phenomenon, we developed a maternal obesity animal model by feeding mice a diet composed of high fat/ high sugar (HF/HS) and assessed both maternal diet and offspring diet on the development of endometrial cancer (ECa). We show that maternal diet by itself did not lead to ECa initiation in wildtype offspring of the C57Bl/6J mouse strain. While offspring fed a HF/HS post-weaning diet resulted in poor metabolic health and decreased uterine weight (regardless of maternal diet), it did not lead to ECa. We also investigated the effects of the maternal obesogenic diet on ECa development in a Diethylstilbestrol (DES) carcinogenesis mouse model. All mice injected with DES had reproductive tract lesions including decreased number of glands, condensed and hyalinized endometrial stroma, and fibrosis and increased collagen deposition that in some mice extended into the myometrium resulting in extensive disruption and loss of the inner and outer muscular layers. Fifty percent of DES mice that were exposed to maternal HF/HS diet developed several features indicative of the initial stages of carcinogenesis including focal glandular and atypical endometrial hyperplasia versus 0% of their Chow counterparts. There was an increase in phospho-Akt expression in DES mice exposed to maternal HF/HS diet, a regulator of persistent proliferation in the endometrium, and no difference in total Akt, phospho-PTEN and total PTEN expression. In summary, maternal HF/HS diet exposure induces endometrial hyperplasia and other precancerous phenotypes in mice treated with DES. This study suggests that maternal obesity alone is not sufficient for the development of ECa, but has an additive effect in the presence of a secondary insult such as DES.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Theresa O.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is relatively high in the southern regions of China. Yunnan, located in southwestern China, has the highest number of ethnic groups. However, HEV infection in the ethnic population is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the seropositive rate, risk factor, and clinical impact of HEV infection in the ethnic groups of Yunnan. We recruited 1912 individuals from four minority groups in three prefectures of Yunnan province. Epidemiological records on potential risk factors for exposure to HEV and blood biochemical index were analyzed. All the serum samples were tested for anti-HEV IgM/IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the IgM-positive samples were subjected to nested reverse transcription-PCR to detect HEV RNA. Overall, 1273 individuals (66.58%) were positive for anti-HEV IgG, 16 (0.84%) for anti-HEV IgM, and 64 (3.35%) for anti-HEV IgG and IgM both; none of them had detectable HEV RNA. Multivariate analysis revealed a strong statistical association between ethnic origin and HEV IgG seroprevalence. Anti-HEV IgG reactivity in the Hani ethnic (82.3%; 401/487) population was higher than that in the Naxi (71.9%, 340/473), Bulang (65.1%; 302/464), and Wa (60.2%; 294/488) ethnic populations (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Older age and male sex were independently associated with the risk of past HEV infection. Moreover, anti-HEV IgG-positive individuals showed significantly higher levels of total and direct bilirubin and alanine amino transferase but significantly lower levels of globulin and low-density lipoprotein, than the respective levels in anti-HEV IgG-negative individuals. Thus, the seroprevalence of HEV infection is high in the ethnic populations of Yunnan, China. It is therefore necessary to increase the surveillance of specific risk groups and raise awareness about the possible infectious diseases to help limit the HEV transmission here.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yue Feng, Yue-Mei Feng, Songmei Wang, Fang Xu, Xuehui Zhang, Chunyue Zhang, Yuanyuan Jia, Wanru Yang, Xueshan Xia, Jianzhong Yin&lt;/p&gt;

An experimental model for postweaning diarrhea with enterotoxigenic &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; F4 (ETEC F4) was set up in piglets, and the efficacy of 1% chestnut-tannin extract in preventing diarrhea was subsequently assessed. In a first trial (infection model), 32 Swiss Large White piglets (age: 24 days; average BW: 7.8 ± 0.8 kg) were randomly assigned to two experimental groups (infected [INF], noninfected [NINF]). In a subsequent trial, 72 Swiss Large White piglets (age: 26 days; average BW: 7.4 ± 1.5 kg) were blocked by BW and assigned within block to four experimental groups: NINF-CO: not infected and fed a standard control starter diet (CO); INF-CO: infected and fed the CO diet; NINF-TA: not infected and fed the CO diet supplemented with 1% chestnut extract containing 54% of hydrolysable tannins (TA); and INF-TA: infected and fed the TA diet. Both diets (TA and CO) were formulated to be isocaloric and isoproteic and to meet or surpass the nutritional requirements. In both trials, four days after weaning, piglets assigned to the INF group received an oral suspension of ETEC F4. Fecal score, ETEC shedding in feces (only in trial 2), and growth performance traits were measured for the following 14 days post infection.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5–60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)—Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-Lung&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)—as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT—because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer—are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift).

Objective &lt;p&gt;Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5–60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)—Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-Lung&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)—as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT—because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer—are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift). Patients with a negative AABT, and those scheduled for CT surveillance alone, are assumed to have periodic CT screenings to detect rapid growth and thus to have their lung cancers diagnosed—on average—at more advanced stages.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 1,000 patients who have incidentally detected nodules 8–30 mm, have an intermediate-risk of lung cancer, and are evaluated by CT surveillance alone, 95 (9.5%) are assumed to have lung cancer (local, 73.6%; regional, 22.0%; distant, 4.4%).

Objective &lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to reveal the factors associated with virologic failure in sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV)-treated patients, and identify baseline NS5A or NS5B resistance-associated substitutions (RASs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Four hundred ninety-three patients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection were treated with SOF/LDV; 31 had a history of interferon (IFN)-free treatment with daclatasvir and asunaprevir. The effect of baseline RASs on the response to SOF/LDV therapy was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) was achieved in 476 patients (96.6%). The SVR12 rates in the patients with IFN-free treatment-naïve and retreatment were 97.6% and 80.6%, respectively. HCV elimination was not achieved in 17 patients, 11 (including 5 with IFN-free retreatment) of whom had virologic failure. Eight patients had coexisting NS5A RASs of Q24, L28 and/or R30, L31, or Y93 and one patient had coexisting NS5A RASs of P32L and A92K. Interestingly, 10 and 8 patients had NS5B A218S and C316N RAS respectively. According to a multivariate analysis, coexisting NS5A RASs, NS5A P32 RAS, NS5B A218 and/or C316 RASs, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase were associated with virologic failure. In the naïve patients, all patients without NS5B A218 and/or C316 RAS achieved an SVR12. Notably, the SVR12 rates of patients with coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were significantly lower (83.3%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although SOF/LDV therapy resulted in a high SVR12 rate, coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were associated with virologic failure.

As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible. Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MQif6tb7BiM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paul A.

This study aims to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCa with bioinformatics. Methods: Original gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE64318 and GSE46602 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted differential screens of the expression of genes (DEGs) between two groups using the R software limma package. The interactions between the differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted and merged with the target genes. Co-expression of the miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected to construct the mRNA-miRNA and -lncRNA interaction networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and the transcription factors were annotated. The expression of hub genes in the TCGA datasets was verified to improve the reliability of our analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that 60 miRNAs, 1578 mRNAs and 61 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks were composed of 5 miRNA nodes, 13 lncRNA nodes, and 45 mRNA nodes. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the nuclei and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of transcription, related to sequence-specific DNA binding, and participated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. These pathways are related to cancer and focal adhesion signalling pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs, 6 lncRNAs, 6 mRNAs and 2 TFs play important regulatory roles in the interaction network. The expression levels of EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1, DLG4, TGFBR1 and KIT were significantly different between PCa and normal prostate tissue. Conclusion: Based on the current study, large-scale effects of interrelated mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs were revealed and a model for predicting the mechanism of PCa was provided. This study provides new insight for the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of PCa and valuable clues for further research.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>Purpose: Prostate cancer (PCa) causes a common male urinary system malignant tumour, and the molecular mechanisms of PCa remain poorly understood.

Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds with variable phenolic structures, have been found to possess anti-cancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors like CDK6. To understand the binding behavior of flavonoids that inhibit the active CDK6, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on six inhibitors, chrysin (M01), fisetin (M03), galangin (M04), genistein (M05), quercetin (M06) and kaempferol (M07), complexed with CDK6/cyclin D. For all six flavonoids, the 3’-OH and 4’-OH of B-ring were found to be favorable for hydrogen bond formation, but the 3-OH on the C-ring and 5-OH on the A-ring were unfavorable, which were confirmed by the MD simulation results of the test molecule, 3’, 4’, 7-trihydroxyflavone (M15). The binding efficiencies of flavonoids against the CDK6/cyclin D complex were mainly through the electrostatic (especially the H-bond force) and vdW interactions with residues ILE19, VAL27, ALA41, GLU61, PHE98, GLN103, ASP163 and LEU152. The order of binding affinities of these flavonoids toward the CDK6/cyclin D was M03 &gt; M01 &gt; M07 &gt; M15 &gt; M06 &gt; M05 &gt; M04. It is anticipated that the binding features of flavonoid inhibitors studied in the present work may provide valuable insights for the development of CDK6 inhibitors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jingxiao Zhang, Lilei Zhang, Yangcheng Xu, Shanshan Jiang, Yueyue Shao&lt;/p&gt;

Spatially explicit modelling allows to estimate population abundance and predict species’ distribution in relation to environmental factors. Abiotic factors are the main determinants of a herbivore´s response to environmental heterogeneity on large spatiotemporal scales. We assessed the influence of elevation, geographic location and distance to the coast on the seasonal abundance and distribution of guanaco (&lt;i&gt;Lama guanicoe&lt;/i&gt;) in central Tierra del Fuego, by means of spatially explicit modelling. The estimated abundance was 23,690 individuals for the non-breeding season and 33,928 individuals for the breeding season. The factors influencing distribution and abundance revealed to be the elevation for the non-breeding season, and the distance to the coast and geographic location for the breeding season. The southwest of the study area presented seasonal abundance variation and the southeast and northeast presented high abundance during both seasons. The elevation would be the driving factor of guanaco distribution, as individuals move to lower areas during the non-breeding season and ascend to high areas during the breeding season. Our results confirm that part of the guanaco population performs seasonal migratory movements and that the main valleys present important wintering habitats for guanacos as well as up-hill zones during summer. This type of study would help to avoid problems of scale mismatch and achieve better results in management actions and is an example of how to assess important seasonal habitats from evaluations of abundance and distribution patterns.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Celina E.

We implemented a web server that compares new datasets to collected data employing fast matching methods in order to determine cell types, key genes, similar prior studies, and more.</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323238v2?rss=1</link><crawled>1527801974842</crawled><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/31/323238</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163b818103a:337b3e1:2835af05</id><published>1527750000000</published><title>scQuery: a web server for comparative analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022389?af=R</originId><fingerprint>b1c4f62a</fingerprint><author><name>Wentao Li</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022389?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><unread>False</unread><title>Free energy study of H2O, N2O5, SO2, and O3 gas sorption by water droplets/slabs</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022389?af=R</link><crawled>1525198996659</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1631cf1c4b3:26b9588:11c251fd</id><published>1525066441000</published><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01880</originId><fingerprint>b500945d</fingerprint><author><name>Cecilia Lindgren, Mohit Tyagi, Johan Viljanen, Johannes Toms, Changrong Ge, Naru Zhang, Rikard Holmdahl, Jan Kihlberg, Anna Linusson</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/jAzfGNunva4/acs.jmedchem.7b01880</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01880/20180524/images/medium/jm-2017-01880b_0012.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01880&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The reliability of any quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiment can be seriously compromised by variations between samples as well as between PCR runs. This usually result from errors in sample quantification, especially with samples that are obtained from different individuals and tissues and have been collected at various time intervals. Errors also arise from differences in qPCR efficiency between assays performed simultaneously to target multiple genes on the same plate. Consequently, the derived quantitative data for the target genes become distorted. To avoid this grievous error, an endogenous control, with relatively constant transcription levels in the target individual or tissue, is included in the qPCR assay to normalize target gene expression levels in the analysis. Several housekeeping genes (HKGs) have been used as endogenous controls in quantification studies of mRNA transcripts; however, there is no record in the literature of the evaluation of these genes for the tick-borne protozoan parasite, &lt;i&gt;Theileria parva&lt;/i&gt;. Importantly, the expression of these genes should be invariable between different &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; stocks, ideally under different experimental conditions, to gain extensive application in gene expression studies of this parasite. Thus, the expression of several widely used HKGs was evaluated in this study, including the genes encoding β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 28S rRNA, cytochrome b and fructose-2.6-biphosphate aldolase (F6P) proteins. The qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of genes encoding cytochrome b, F6P and GAPDH varied considerably between the two &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; stocks investigated, the cattle-derived &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; Muguga and the buffalo-derived &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; 7014. 28S rRNA and β-actin gene expression was the most stable; thus, these genes were considered suitable candidates to be used as endogenous control genes for mRNA quantification studies in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Teboho N.

The current research developed and validated a Korean-translated version of the Personal Relative Deprivation Scale (PRDS). The PRDS measures individual differences in people’s tendencies to feel resentful about what they have compared to what other people like them have. Across 2 studies, Exploratory Factor Analyses revealed that the two reverse-worded items from the original PRDS did not load onto the primary factor for the Korean-translated PRDS. A reduced 3-item Korean PRDS, however, showed good convergent validity. Replicating previous findings using Western samples, greater tendencies to make social comparisons of abilities (but not opinions) were associated with higher PRDS (Studies 1 and 2), and participants scoring higher on the 3-item Korean PRDS were more materialistic (Studies 1 and 2), reported worse physical health (Study 1), had lower self-esteem (Study 2) and experienced higher stress (Study 2).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunji Kim, Eunbee Kim, Eunkook M.

Across 2 studies, Exploratory Factor Analyses revealed that the two reverse-worded items from the original PRDS did not load onto the primary factor for the Korean-translated PRDS. A reduced 3-item Korean PRDS, however, showed good convergent validity. Replicating previous findings using Western samples, greater tendencies to make social comparisons of abilities (but not opinions) were associated with higher PRDS (Studies 1 and 2), and participants scoring higher on the 3-item Korean PRDS were more materialistic (Studies 1 and 2), reported worse physical health (Study 1), had lower self-esteem (Study 2) and experienced higher stress (Study 2).</description><unread>True</unread><title>Development and preliminary validation of a Korean version of the Personal Relative Deprivation Scale</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197279</link><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197279</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e7:2835af05</id><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</originId><fingerprint>1849e939</fingerprint><author><name>Mohammad Enamul Haque</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods. As exemplified by the targeted gene identification of a master regulator WRI1, which regulates fatty acid biosynthesis, we found that the improved ChIP method worked well. We analyzed percentage input and fold changes of the ChIPed DNA. We also made successful ChIP-seq libraries using this method. This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Interferon lambda (IFNλ) is a group of cytokines that belong to the IL-10 family. They exhibit antiviral activities against certain viruses during infection of the liver and mucosal tissues. Here we report that IFNλ restricts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; replication of the β-herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV). However, IFNλR1-deficient (&lt;i&gt;Ifnλr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were not preferentially susceptible to mCMV infection &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; during acute infection after systemic or mucosal challenge, or during virus persistence in the mucosa. Instead, our studies revealed that IFNλ influences NK cell responses during mCMV infection. &lt;i&gt;Ifnλr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited defective development of conventional interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-expressing NK cells in the spleen during mCMV infection whereas accumulation of granzyme B-expressing NK cells was unaltered. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, development of splenic IFNγ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; NK cells following stimulation with IL-12 or, to a lesser extent, IL-18 was abrogated by IFNλR1-deficiency. Thus, IFNλ regulates NK cell responses during mCMV infection and restricts virus replication &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; but is redundant in the control of acute and persistent mCMV replication within mucosal and non-mucosal tissues.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Gimeno Brias, Morgan Marsden, Jessica Forbester, Mathew Clement, Cordelia Brandt, Katherine Harcourt, Leanne Kane, Lucy Chapman, Simon Clare, Ian R.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Higher prevalence of suicide notes could signify more conservatism in accounting and greater proneness to undercounting of suicide by method. We tested two hypotheses: (1) an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011–2013, the study population comprised registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome measure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning suicides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof. Findings and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better training, and more resources to support comprehensive and accurate case ascertainment, as the foundation for developing evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ian R.

Serum starvation is a routine protocol for synchronizing nuclear donor cells to G0/G1 phase during somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, abrupt serum deprivation can cause serious stress to the cells cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, which might result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, chromosome damage, and finally reduce the success rate of SCNT. In the present study, the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an effective ER stress-relieving drug, on the nuclear donor cells under serum deprivation condition as well as following SCNT procedures were first assessed in the bovine. The results showed that TUDCA significantly reduced ER stress and cell apoptosis in those nuclear donor cells. Moreover, it significantly decreased the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt;, and increased the level of H3K9 acetylation in nuclear donor cells compared with control group. SCNT reconstructed embryos cloned from TUDCA-treated donor cells showed significantly higher fusion, cleavage, blastocyst formation rate, total cell number in day 7 blastocysts, and lower apoptotic index than that from control group. In addition, the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bax&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in blastocysts derived from TUDCA-treated donor cells than that from control group. In conclusion, TUDCA significantly reduced the ER stress of nuclear donor cells under serum starvation condition, and significantly improved the developmental competence of following SCNT reconstructed embryos when these TUDCA-treated cells were used as the nuclear donors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ying Zhang, Pengxiang Qu, Xiaonan Ma, Fang Qiao, Yefei Ma, Suzhu Qing, Yong Zhang, Yongsheng Wang, Wei Cui&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover, it significantly decreased the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt;, and increased the level of H3K9 acetylation in nuclear donor cells compared with control group. SCNT reconstructed embryos cloned from TUDCA-treated donor cells showed significantly higher fusion, cleavage, blastocyst formation rate, total cell number in day 7 blastocysts, and lower apoptotic index than that from control group. In addition, the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bax&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in blastocysts derived from TUDCA-treated donor cells than that from control group. In conclusion, TUDCA significantly reduced the ER stress of nuclear donor cells under serum starvation condition, and significantly improved the developmental competence of following SCNT reconstructed embryos when these TUDCA-treated cells were used as the nuclear donors.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress of nuclear donor cells under serum starvation</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196785</link><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196785</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a191:93d646dc</id><published>1525294800000</published><updated>1525294800000</updated></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321919v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>bd244848</fingerprint><author><name>Russell, P.

However, computational identification of lncRNAs in a wide range of species remains challenging; it requires prior knowledge of well-established sequences and annotations or species-specific training data, but the reality is that only a limited number of species have high-quality sequences and annotations. Here we first characterize lncRNAs by contrast to protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship and find that the feature relationship between ORF (open reading frame) length and GC content presents universally substantial divergence in lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs, as observed in a broad variety of species. Based on the feature relationship, accordingly, we further present LGC, a novel algorithm for identifying lncRNAs that is able to accurately distinguish lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs in a cross-species manner without any prior knowledge. As validated on large-scale empirical datasets, comparative results show that LGC outperforms existing algorithms by achieving higher accuracy, well-balanced sensitivity and specificity, and is robustly effective (&gt;90% accuracy) in discriminating lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs across diverse species that range from plants to mammals. To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, differentially characterizes lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship, which is further applied in computational identification of lncRNAs.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to identify potential CpG site(s) or DNA methylation pattern(s) in the pseudo α-globin 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene), the gene which locates in α-thalassemia-1 deletion mutation, to differentiate plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;DNA methylation profiles of placenta and peripheral blood from the MethBase database were compared to screen differentially methylated regions. This region was confirmed the differential by methylation-sensitive high resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. The differential region was used to compare DNA methylation profile of plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women by bisulfite amplicon sequencing in three levels: overall, individual CpG sites and individual molecules (DNA methylation patterns).&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Using MethBase data, four consecutive CpG sites in the &lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene were identified as regions of differential DNA methylation between placenta and peripheral blood. The confirmation by MS-HRM showed the differential DNA methylation profile between the placenta and plasma from non-pregnant women. The comparison of DNA methylation profiles between the plasma of pregnant and non-pregnant women showed that, in the overall levels of the four CpG sites, DNA methylation of pregnant women was detected at lower levels than non-pregnant women. In the individual CpG site level, only the second CpG site showed differential DNA methylation between the groups. In the DNA methylation pattern level, there was no strongly significant differences in DNA methylation patterns between the pregnant and non-pregnant groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our result demonstrated that, in the plasma from pregnant women, only one of the four CpG sites displays a decrease in DNA methylation compared with non-pregnant women. It indicates that this CpG site might be useful for determining the presence or absence of fetal wild-type α-globin gene cluster allele in maternal plasma.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tanapat Pangeson, Torpong Sanguansermsri, Khwanruedee Mahingsa, Phanchana Sanguansermsri&lt;/p&gt;

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Systems (UAV or UAS) have become increasingly popular in recent years for agricultural research applications. UAS are capable of acquiring images with high spatial and temporal resolutions that are ideal for applications in agriculture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a UAS-based remote sensing system for quantification of crop growth parameters of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) including leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and yield. The study was conducted at the Texas A&amp;amp;M Research Farm near College Station, Texas, United States. A fixed-wing UAS equipped with a multispectral sensor was used to collect image data during the 2016 growing season (April–October). Flight missions were successfully carried out at 50 days after planting (DAP; 25 May), 66 DAP (10 June) and 74 DAP (18 June). These flight missions provided image data covering the middle growth period of sorghum with a spatial resolution of approximately 6.5 cm. Field measurements of LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were also collected. Four vegetation indices were calculated using the UAS images. Among those indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed the highest correlation with LAI, f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and yield with R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values of 0.91, 0.89 and 0.58 respectively. Empirical relationships between NDVI and LAI and between NDVI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were validated and proved to be accurate for estimating LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; from UAS-derived NDVI values. NDVI determined from UAS imagery acquired during the flowering stage (74 DAP) was found to be the most highly correlated with final grain yield. The observed high correlations between UAS-derived NDVI and the crop growth parameters (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, LAI and grain yield) suggests the applicability of UAS for within-season data collection of agricultural crops such as sorghum.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanaz Shafian, Nithya Rajan, Ronnie Schnell, Muthukumar Bagavathiannan, John Valasek, Yeyin Shi, Jeff Olsenholler&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively reviewed the evolution of segmentectomy for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and the feasibility of multi- and single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Of 348 patients undergoing surgery for TB, the medical records of 121 patients undergoing segmentectomy between January 1996 and November 2015 were reviewed. Clinical information and computed tomography (CT) image characteristics were investigated and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighteen patients underwent direct or intended thoracotomy. Sixty-four underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy (VATS), including 53 multi-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (MITS), and 11 single-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (SITS). Thirty-nine were converted to thoracotomy. The intended thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and hospital stay (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) than the VATS group although the VATS group had higher grade of cavity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007). The intended thoracotomy group did not differ from converted thoracotomy in operative time, blood loss, or hospital stay, and the grade of pleural thickening was higher in the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). The converted thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss, hospital stay, and complication rate than the MITS group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009, respectively). The MITS group had lower pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, cavity, and tuberculoma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.017, respectively). The SITS group had lower grading in pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, and aspergilloma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, 0.010, and 0.031, respectively). Four patients in the intended thoracotomy group and seven in the converted thoracotomy group had complications compared with three patients in the MITS and two in the SITS group. Risk factors of conversion were pleural thickening and peribronchial lymph node calcification.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although segmentectomy is technically challenging in patients with pulmonary TB, it could be safely performed using MITS or SITS and should be attempted in selected patients.

Background &lt;p&gt;Maternal nutrition during pregnancy has been related to intrauterine brain development and neurodevelopmental disabilities in adult life. We aim to investigate associations between periconceptional maternal dietary patterns and prenatal cerebellar growth from the first trimester onwards.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;126 women with singleton non-malformed pregnancies were enrolled before 8 weeks of gestation in the Rotterdam periconceptional cohort between 2013 and 2015. Periconceptional maternal dietary patterns were extracted from food frequency questionnaires and associated with blood biomarkers and micronutrient intakes. Serial two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasound scans were performed at 9, 11, 22, 26 and 32 weeks of gestation for transcerebellar diameter (TCD) measurement. Linear mixed models were estimated to investigate associations between periconceptional maternal dietary patterns and longitudinal TCD measurements as a function of gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We performed a median of 4 scans per pregnancy, resulting in 570 total datasets. The success rate of TCD measurements was 87% (range 65–100%), depending on gestational age. The Mediterranean, Western, egg-rich and dairy-rich dietary patterns were extracted, explaining 37.2% of the overall variance of food intake in this population. The dairy-rich dietary pattern was positively associated with cerebellar growth trajectories (β = 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01; 0.03) √mm, p = 0.01). Maternal strong adherence to this dietary pattern increased TCD measurements by 0.8 standard deviation scores (SDs) compared to weak adherence, reflected in increased TCD estimates of 0.44 mm at 9 weeks (+6.8%), 0.88 mm at 22 weeks (+3.6%), and 1.17 mm at 32 weeks (+2.8%). No significant associations were detected for the Mediterranean, Western and egg-rich dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study shows a positive association between periconceptional maternal adherence to a dairy-rich dietary pattern and human prenatal TCD measurements as a proxy of cerebellar growth.

In addition, three new carotenoid compounds have been identified.</description><unread>True</unread><title>Uncovering production of specialized metabolites by &amp;lt;i&gt;Streptomyces argillaceus&amp;lt;/i&gt;: Activation of cryptic biosynthesis gene clusters using nutritional and genetic approaches</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198145</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198145</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e3c:2835af05</id><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-c?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>6c8b87a5</fingerprint><keywords><item>Materials Science, Physics</item></keywords><author><name>Stajic, J.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-c?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/870.3.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-c?rss=1</link><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce950:3dd877af</id><published>1527183688000</published><title>Tracking the spin-valley current</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197324</originId><fingerprint>bf46c585</fingerprint><author><name>Emmanuel Olorunleke Adewuyi</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197324</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emmanuel Olorunleke Adewuyi, Asa Auta, Vishnu Khanal, Olasunkanmi David Bamidele, Cynthia Pomaa Akuoko, Kazeem Adefemi, Samson Joseph Tapshak, Yun Zhao&lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Antenatal care (ANC) is a major public health intervention aimed at ensuring safe pregnancy outcomes. In Nigeria, the recommended minimum of four times ANC attendance is underutilized. This study investigates the prevalence and factors associated with underutilization of ANC services with a focus on the differences between rural and urban residences in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey dataset with adjustment for the sampling weight and the cluster design of the survey. The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was assessed using frequency tabulation while associated factors were examined using Chi-Square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was 46.5% in Nigeria, 61.1% in rural residence and 22.4% in urban residence. The North-West region had the highest prevalence of ANC underuse in Nigeria at 69.3%, 76.6% and 44.8% for the overall, rural and urban residences respectively. Factors associated with greater odds of ANC underuse in rural residence were maternal non-working status, birth interval &amp;lt; 24 months, single birth type, not listening to radio at all, lack of companionship to health facility and not getting money for health services. In urban residence, mothers professing Islam, those who did not read newspaper at all, and those who lacked health insurance, had greater odds of ANC underuse. In both rural and urban residence, maternal and husband’s education level, region of residence, wealth index, maternal age, frequency of watching television, distance to- and permission to visit health facility were significantly associated with ANC underuse.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural-urban differences exist in the use of ANC services, and to varying degrees, factors associated with underuse of ANC in Nigeria.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;In two concurrent studies, we aimed to a) confirm the acute effect of 0.3 g·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight (BW) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) supplementation on central and peripheral mechanisms associated with explosive power (Study 1) and b) determine whether chronic NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation would improve the adaptive response of the neuromuscular system during a 10-week resistance training program (Study 2).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight resistance trained participants volunteered after providing written consent. The experimental design consisted of a week of baseline testing, followed by ten weeks of training with progress measures performed in Week 5. Study 1 involved neuromuscular measurements before and after the leg extension portion of a power based training session performed in Week 1. Changes in maximal torque (MVT) and rates of torque development (RTD), along with other variables derived from femoral nerve stimulation (e.g. voluntary activation, neural recruitment) were analysed to determine the extent of fatigue under NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or placebo conditions. Changes in these same variables, coupled with functional 1-repetition maximum leg extension strength, were measured in Study 2 from baseline (Week 0) to Week 5, and again at Week 10.&lt;/p&gt; Results and conclusion &lt;p&gt;In Study 1, we observed a decline after the leg extension task in both MVT (~ 30%) and rates of torque production (RTD) irrespective of acid-base status, however the decline in maximal RTD (RTD&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;) was nearly 20% less in the NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; condition when compared to placebo (mean difference of 294.8 ± 133.4 Nm·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (95% CI -583.1 to -6.5 Nm, p &amp;lt; 0.05)). The primary finding in Study 2, however, suggests that introducing NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; repeatedly during a 10-week RT program does not confer any additional benefit to the mechanisms (and subsequent adaptive processes) related to explosive power production.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jason C.

Urbanization has been driven by various social, economic, and political factors around the world for centuries. Because urbanization continues unabated in many places, it is crucial to understand patterns of urbanization and their potential ecological and environmental impacts. Given this need, the objectives of our study were to quantify urban growth rates, growth modes, and resultant changes in the landscape pattern of urbanization in Hanoi, Vietnam from 1993 to 2010 and to evaluate the extent to which the process of urban growth in Hanoi conformed to the diffusion-coalescence theory. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of the built-up land in Hanoi using landscape expansion modes, spatial metrics, and a gradient approach. Urbanization was most pronounced in the periods of 2001–2006 and 2006–2010 at a distance of 10 to 35 km around the urban center. Over the 17 year period urban expansion in Hanoi was dominated by infilling and edge expansion growth modes. Our findings support the diffusion-coalescence theory of urbanization. The shift of the urban growth areas over time and the dynamic nature of the spatial metrics revealed important information about our understanding of the urban growth process and cycle. Furthermore, our findings can be used to evaluate urban planning policies and aid in urbanization issues in rapidly urbanizing countries.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Duong H.

To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;Food’s environmental impacts are created by millions of diverse producers.

Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>524</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/987?rss=1</link><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d099c:2835af05</id><published>1527788426000</published><engagementRate>29.11</engagementRate><title>Reducing foods environmental impacts through producers and consumers</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.85</originId><fingerprint>d288d4a7</fingerprint><author><name>Megan Cully</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/sB-hpHhgeF4/nrd.2018.85</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer: Personalized cancer vaccines hit the spot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer: Personalized cancer vaccines hit the spot, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.85&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.85&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cancer: Personalized cancer vaccines hit the spot&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/sB-hpHhgeF4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cancer: Personalized cancer vaccines hit the spot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer: Personalized cancer vaccines hit the spot, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.85&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.85&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cancer: Personalized cancer vaccines hit the spot&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/sB-hpHhgeF4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.85</link><crawled>1527657172334</crawled><visual><height>200</height><width>300</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nrd.2018.85-i1.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_163af768d6e:24effff:2835af05</id><published>1527663600000</published><title>Cancer: Personalized cancer vaccines hit the spot</title><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.85</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00184</originId><fingerprint>75ef2070</fingerprint><author><name>María Georgina Herrera, María Florencia Pignataro, Martín Ezequiel Noguera, Karen Magalí Cruz, Javier Santos</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/acbcct/~3/otNyYIV1Sys/acschembio.8b00184</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00184/20180516/images/medium/cb-2018-00184s_0003.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00184&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Statistical inference is a widely-used, powerful tool for learning about natural processes in diverse fields. The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50% the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cole C.

Niche construction theory states that not only does the environment act on populations to generate Darwinian selection, but organisms reciprocally modify the environment and the sources of natural selection. Cancer cells participate in niche construction as they alter their microenvironments and create pre-metastatic niches; in fact, metastasis is a product of niche construction. Here, we present a mathematical model of niche construction and metastasis. Our model contains producers, which pay a cost to contribute to niche construction that benefits all tumor cells, and cheaters, which reap the benefits without paying the cost. We derive expressions for the conditions necessary for metastasis, showing that the establishment of a mutant lineage that promotes metastasis depends on niche construction specificity and strength of interclonal competition. We identify a tension between the arrival and invasion of metastasis-promoting mutants, where tumors composed only of cheaters remain small but are susceptible to invasion whereas larger tumors containing producers may be unable to facilitate metastasis depending on the level of niche construction specificity. Our results indicate that even if metastatic subclones arise through mutation, metastasis may be hindered by interclonal competition, providing a potential explanation for recent surprising findings that most metastases are derived from early mutants in primary tumors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jimmy J.

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;

Sleep science is entering a new era, thanks to new data-driven analysis approaches that, combined with mouse gene–editing technologies, show a promise in functional genomics and translational research. However, the investigation of sleep is time consuming and not suitable for large-scale phenotypic datasets, mainly due to the need for subjective manual annotations of electrophysiological states. Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of sleep, with all its physiological aspects, is not fully accounted for by the current system of sleep stage classification. In this study, we present a new data-driven analysis approach offering a plethora of novel features for the characterization of sleep. This novel approach allowed for identifying several substages of sleep that were hidden to standard analysis. For each of these substages, we report an independent set of homeostatic responses following sleep deprivation. By using our new substages classification, we have identified novel differences among various genetic backgrounds. Moreover, in a specific experiment with the &lt;i&gt;Zfhx3&lt;/i&gt; mouse line, a recent circadian mutant expressing both shortening of the circadian period and abnormal sleep architecture, we identified specific sleep states that account for genotypic differences at specific times of the day. These results add a further level of interaction between circadian clock and sleep homeostasis and indicate that dissecting sleep in multiple states is physiologically relevant and can lead to the discovery of new links between sleep phenotypes and genetic determinants. Therefore, our approach has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding of sleep physiology through the study of single mutations. Moreover, this study paves the way to systematic high-throughput analyses of sleep.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bBGe8ybdGnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou, Diego Sona, Matteo Zanotto, Glenda Lassi, Celina Garcia-Garcia, Valter Tucci, Vittorio Murino&lt;/p&gt;

This theory remains largely untested at the molecular level. Here, we analyzed enhancer evolution in primates to investigate the relationships between aging-related diseases and enhancers acquired after the human-chimpanzee divergence. We report a 5-fold increased evolutionary rate of enhancers that are activated in neural tissues, leading to fixation of ∼100 human-specific enhancers potentially under adaptation. These enhancers show prognostic expression levels and correlations with driver genes in cancer, and their nearby genes are enriched in known loci associated with aging-related diseases. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we further functionally validated an enhancer on chr8p23.1 as activator counteracting REST, a master regulator known to be a transcriptional suppressor of Alzheimer disease. Our results suggest an evolutionary origin of aging-related diseases: the side effects of human-specific, neural-tissue expressed enhancers.

The main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a 12-week water aerobics program in a real-life context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults. Fifteen volunteers (58.80 ± 14.32 years old) were part of an experimental group (Exercise), and eight volunteers (59.00 ± 12.26 years old) were part of the control group (Control). The Exercise performed 45 min of water aerobics twice a week for 12 weeks; no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period. The evaluations were performed the week before (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry, lipid profile and blood pressure. Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in post-training moment. However, there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced body fat (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced systolic blood pressure (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.14) and triglycerides (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19) in Exercise. Within groups changes showed that the training program caused an increase mainly in explosive strength in the upper limbs (0.26 m, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.49; ES = 0.63) In addition, there was a significant decrease in fat mass (-0.89%, 95% CI, -1.74, -0.03; ES = 0.61) and in the systolic blood pressure (-0.83 mmHg, -1.46, -0.19; ES = 0.71). Nonetheless, no significant changes were observed for the lipid profile. These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Henrique Pereira Neiva, Luís Brandão Faíl, Mikel Izquierdo, Mário C.

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a plant trait that involves interactions between nuclear- and mitochondrial genomes. In CMS, the nuclear &lt;i&gt;restorer-of-fertility&lt;/i&gt; gene (&lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;), a suppressor of male-sterility inducing mitochondria, is one of the best known genetic factors. Other unidentified genetic factors may exist but have not been well characterized. In sugar beet (&lt;i&gt;Beta vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L.), CMS is used for hybrid seed production, but few male-sterility inducing nuclear genotypes exist. Such genotypes could be introduced from a closely related plant such as leaf beet, but first the fertility restoring genotype of the related plant must be characterized. Here, we report the discovery of a Japanese leaf beet accession ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ that has both male-sterility inducing and fertility restoring genotypes. We crossed the leaf beet accession with a sugar beet CMS line, developed succeeding generations, and examined the segregation of two DNA markers that are linked to two sugar beet &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;s, &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt;. Only the &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt; marker co-segregated with fertility restoration in every generation, implying that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus in leaf beet is occupied by a non-restoring allele. Fertility restoration was incomplete without a genetic factor closely linked to &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt;, leading to the assumption that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus encodes a modifier that cannot restore fertility by itself but perhaps strengthens another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;. We sequenced the apparently non-restoring ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; gene-coding region and found that it closely resembles a restoring allele. The protein product demonstrated its potential to suppress CMS in transgenic suspension cells.

Accordingly, we concluded that ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; is a hypomorph that acts as a non-restoring allele but has the potential to support another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. it is a modifier candidate.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takumi Arakawa, Daisuke Uchiyama, Takashi Ohgami, Ryo Ohgami, Tomoki Murata, Yujiro Honma, Hiroyuki Hamada, Yosuke Kuroda, Kazunori Taguchi, Kazuyoshi Kitazaki, Tomohiko Kubo&lt;/p&gt;

While numerous papers have illuminated the worthiness of research collaboration, relatively few have addressed its prerequisites. In our study, seven prerequisites for research collaboration were extracted from the existing literature, and 460 student researchers were surveyed for their perceptions of the prerequisites’ importance. Focusing on voluntary research collaborations rather than brokered ones, it was found that socially oriented prerequisites such as reciprocal interactions, accountability, trust, and equality are perceived of more importance than prerequisites of psychical proximity, networking channels, and funds and material supplies (substance- and entity-related prerequisites). With latent regression analyses, we also found that Chinese and older, more experienced researchers are inclined to stress the importance of equality. Researchers of different cohorts prioritise substance- and entity-related prerequisites disparately. Specifically, Chinese researchers emphasise the necessity of funds, while researchers from first-tier universities place more value on networking channels. Disciplinary differences for the prerequisite of proximity were also discovered. Based on these results, discussion and implications were referred. Further suggestions on research collaboration studies are rendered.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sisi Li, Chang Zhu, Shasha Li&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cancer and factor V Leiden mutation are both risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Cancer critically increases the thrombotic risk whereas Factor V Leiden is the most common pro-thrombotic mutation. The impact of the factor V Leiden on the risk of VTE in cancer patients remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the impact of factor V Leiden mutation in cancer-associated thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The EDITH hospital-based case-control study enrolled 182 patients with cancer and VTE as well as 182 control patients with cancer, matched for gender, age and cancer location, between 2000 and 2012, in the University Hospital of Brest. All cases and controls were genotyped for the factor V Leiden mutation and interviewed with a standardized questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty one of 182 (11.5%) patients with cancer-associated thrombosis carried the factor V Leiden mutation and 4 of 182 (2.2%) controls with cancer but no venous thrombosis. In multivariate analysis including cancer stage and family history of VTE, cancer patients with factor V Leiden mutation had a seven-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.04; 95% CI, 2.01–24.63).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The pro-thrombotic Factor V Leiden mutation was found to be an independent additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients and might therefore be considered in the individual thrombotic risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adeline Heraudeau, Aurélien Delluc, Mickaël Le Henaff, Karine Lacut, Christophe Leroyer, Benoit Desrues, Francis Couturaud, Cécile Tromeur&lt;/p&gt;

In multivariate analysis including cancer stage and family history of VTE, cancer patients with factor V Leiden mutation had a seven-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.04; 95% CI, 2.01–24.63).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The pro-thrombotic Factor V Leiden mutation was found to be an independent additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients and might therefore be considered in the individual thrombotic risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><title>Risk of venous thromboembolism in association with factor V leiden in cancer patients – The EDITH case-control study</title><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194973</link><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194973</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7215:2835af05</id><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198560</originId><fingerprint>9ab87bd2</fingerprint><author><name>Liang Chen</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198560</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Liang Chen, Junying Heng, Suya Qin, Ke Bian&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; head blight (FHB) mainly caused by &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt;, always brings serious damage to wheat production worldwide. In this study, we found that strain LM2303 had strong antagonist activity against &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; and significantly reduced disease severity of FHB with the control efficiency of 72.3% under field conditions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the biocontrol potential of strain LM2303 against FHB, an integrated approach of genome mining and chemical analysis was employed. The whole genome of strain LM2303 was obtained and analyzed, showing the largest number of genes/gene clusters associated with biocontrol functions as compared with the known biocontrol strains (FZB42, M75, CAU B946). And strain LM2303 was accurately determined as a member of the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;velezensis&lt;/i&gt; clade using the phylogenomic analysis of single-copy core genes. Through genome mining, 13 biosynthetic gene clusters(BGCs) encoding secondary metabolites with biocontrol functions were identified, which were further confirmed through chemical analyses such as UHPLC-ESI-MS, including three antifungal metabolites (fengycin B, iturin A, and surfactin A), eight antibacterial metabolites (surfactin A, butirosin, plantazolicin and hydrolyzed plantazolicin, kijanimicin, bacilysin, difficidin, bacillaene A and bacillaene B, 7-o-malonyl macrolactin A and 7-o-succinyl macrolactin A), the siderophore bacillibactin, molybdenum cofactor and teichuronic acid. In addition, genes/gene clusters involved in plant colonization, plant growth promotion and induced systemic resistance were also found and analyzed, along with the corresponding metabolites. Finally, four different mechanisms of strain LM2303 involved in the biocontrol of FHB were putatively obtained. This work provides better insights into a mechanistic understanding of strain LM2303 in control of FHB, reinforcing the higher potential of this strain as a powerful biocontrol strain agent (BCA) for FHB control. The results also provide scientific reference and comparison for other biocontrol strains.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liang Chen, Junying Heng, Suya Qin, Ke Bian&lt;/p&gt;

They’re specifically addressing the “make it less lipophilic” rule of thumb that many medicinal chemists have, and they demonstrate that this isn’t exactly a universal law. You have to take it case by case, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-285x300.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-285x300.jpeg 285w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-768x807.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-300x315.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot.jpeg 818w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13511&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re working from Genentech’s large database of rat i.v. PK data, stability in rat heptatocytes, and measured (not calculated) logD values. That’s a lot of hard-won data (4767 compounds total), and I’m glad that they’re sharing conclusion from it. The plot at right is an example; each dot is a compound, and they’re shaded according to logD values (&amp;lt;0 to &gt;4). What you see is that IV clearance and (unbound, steady-state) volume of distribution are strongly correlated, and that for the most part this graph is spread along compound lipophilicity. There are outliers (there are always outliers), but that’s the way to bet. As for half-life itself, the spreads in the data are pretty wide, but if anything, higher lipophilicity is correlated with longer i.v. half-life. The Merck paper linked to above also noted that increasing lipophilicity can be a way to extend half-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in that paper, the Genentech team also did an extensive matched-molecular-pairs analysis, and they found a number of transformations that have a good probability of extending half-life (and they’re similar to the earlier paper). Nitrile to fluoroalkyl, methyl to fluorinated methyl, H to CF3, and tetrahydropyran to phenyl all have a good shot. In general, improving clearance in the rat hepatocyte assay has about a 67% chance of helping your half-life, and if you can do that without decreasing lipophilicity, you have an 82% shot. (I would guess that many of those are fluorinations and chlorinations). Just lowering the LogD, on the other hand, only works about 30% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But wait”, you may be saying. “If I start halogenating my compound, its solubility will probably go to pieces and its off-target binding may well go up!” This, in those deal-with-the-devil stories, is the point where the mysterious stranger slips up and his business partner catches a glimpse of his cloven feet. That is exactly the sort of deal being offered by pharmacokinetics and compound property analysis: no free lunch has yet been delivered. You have to make these changes in full knowledge that helping one aspect of the compound’s behavior may well hurt another one, and proceed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis (as the paper notes) doesn’t deal with charged compounds; they’re a whole other subject. And it also doesn’t go into the other ways around these problems, such as slow-release formulations, etc. But discovery-phase projects generally aren’t thinking about those things either – they’re trying to get compound behavior that doesn’t need the extra work later on. So if you’re in that part of the business, the advice from this paper is to pay attention to hepatocyte clearance assays, don’t be afraid to keep your lipophilicity where it is (or even raise it a bit, while watching for potential trouble), and don’t assume that just making the compound more polar is going to fix much of anything. And pay attention to metabolic hot spots – those are a big reason why those halogenations keep working  in these analyses. It’s more work to do metabolite ID, and often more difficult, chemically, to address those problems than it is to make general polarity changes. But it’s time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/03/pharmacokinetic-advice-from-genentech</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><engagement>1</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><title>In the Pipeline</title></origin><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13510</link><crawled>1525351476757</crawled><summary><content>Here’s another solid pharmacokinetics paper, this one from Genentech, with advice on how to extend drug half-life (compare this other recent one).

The insect-transmitted protozoan parasite &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; experiences changes in nutrient availability and rate of flux through different metabolic pathways across its life cycle. The species encompasses much genetic diversity of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes among isolated strains. The genetic or expression variation of both genomes are likely to impact metabolic responses to environmental stimuli, and even steady state metabolic function, among strains. To begin formal characterization these differences, we compared aspects of metabolism between genetically similar strains CL Brener and Tulahuen with less similar Esmeraldo and Sylvio X10 strains in a culture environment. Epimastigotes of all strains took up glucose at similar rates. However, the degree of medium acidification that could be observed when glucose was absent from the medium varied by strain, indicating potential differences in excreted metabolic byproducts. Our main focus was differences related to electron transport chain function. We observed differences in ATP-coupled respiration and maximal respiratory capacity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial morphology between strains, despite the fact that abundances of two nuclear-encoded proteins of the electron transport chain are similar between strains. RNA sequencing reveals strain-specific differences in abundances of mRNAs encoding proteins of the respiratory chain but also other metabolic processes. From these differences in metabolism and mitochondrial phenotypes we have generated tentative models for the differential metabolic fluxes or differences in gene expression that may underlie these results.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Murat C.

Establishing the tissue source of epithelial cells within a biological sample is an important capability for forensic laboratories. In this study we used Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC) to analyze individual cells recovered from buccal, epidermal, and vaginal samples that had been dried between 24 hours and more than eight weeks. Measurements capturing the size, shape, and fluorescent properties of cells were collected in an automated manner and then used to build a multivariate statistical framework for differentiating cells based on tissue type. Results showed that epidermal cells could be distinguished from vaginal and buccal cells using a discriminant function analysis of IFC measurements with an average classification accuracy of ~94%. Ultimately, cellular measurements such as these, which can be obtained non-destructively, may provide probative information for many types of biological samples and complement results from standard genetic profiling techniques.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emily R.

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern. However, very little data is available on prevalence of these bacteria in surface water throughout a watershed. This study aimed to characterize &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; present in the Upper Oconee Watershed, a mixed-use watershed in Athens, GA, USA for potential pathogenicity and AR. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; were enumerated by colony counts, cultured by enrichment and direct plating, and characterized by phylo-groups, diarrheagenic pathotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility. From the analysis, 99.3% (455/458) of the total samples were positive for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resulting in 496 isolates. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; counts were as high as 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/100 ml, which is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) threshold for recreational water (235 CFU/100 ml based on a one-time measurement). Phylo-groups B2 (31.7%; 157/496) and B1 (30.8%; 153/496) were the most prevalent among the isolates. Enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) (19/496) and Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) (1/496) were the only diarrheagenic pathotypes detected. AR was observed in 6.9% (34/496) of the isolates, 15 of which were multidrug resistant (MDR; resistance to two or more classes of antimicrobials). Tetracycline resistance was most often detected (76.5%; 26/34), followed by ampicillin (32.4%; 11/34), streptomycin (23.5%; 8/34), sulfisoxazole (23.5%; 8/34), and nalidixic acid (14.7%; 5/34). Results from this study showed that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; is prevalent in high levels in the Upper Oconee Watershed, suggesting possible widespread fecal contamination. The presence of pathogenic, AR &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; in the watershed indicates that environmental water can serve as a reservoir of resistant bacteria that may be transferred to humans through drinking and recreational activities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sohyun Cho, Lari M.
