In preparation for dramatic morphogenetic events of gastrulation, rapid embryonic cell cycles slow at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; embryos, down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of heterochromatic satellite sequences and extending S phase. We found that Cdk1 activity inhibited the chromatin association of Rap1 interacting factor 1 (Rif1), a candidate repressor of replication. Furthermore, Rif1 bound selectively to satellite sequences following Cdk1 down-regulation at the MBT. In the next S phase, Rif1 dissociated from different satellites in an orderly schedule that anticipated their replication. Rif1 lacking potential phosphorylation sites failed to dissociate and dominantly prevented completion of replication. Loss of Rif1 in mutant embryos shortened the post-MBT S phase and rescued embryonic cell cycles disrupted by depletion of the S phase–promoting kinase, cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7). Our work shows that Rif1 and S phase kinases compose a replication timer controlling first the developmental onset of late replication and then the precise schedule of replication within S phase. In addition, we describe how onset of late replication fits into the progressive maturation of heterochromatin during development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ajE-XA15ViE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1634b38b8d6:499b84:abeb7260</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charles A.

Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development. In human societies, however, there exists bias toward interacting with partners with similar characteristics, but not contributing globally. We study how complex interactive behaviors evolve under risks through proposing a threshold public goods game model. In the model, individuals either play games with participants who own the same phenotype, or contribute to the collective target of global public goods. We further introduce an insurance compensation mechanism into the model to probe the evolution of global cooperation. It is found that the introduction of the insurance remarkably promotes the emergence of global cooperative behavior and inhibits the tendency to play games only with individuals of the same phenotype. Besides, contrary to models without insurance, global cooperation is strengthened with the increase of imitation intensities. In addition, high risk and high threshold are in favor of global cooperation.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197574</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7224:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinming Du&lt;/p&gt;

Importantly, reconstitution of iNKT cells in these mice mitigated their disease, suggesting that the combined defects in negative selection and iNKT cells due to altered HDAC7 function can cause tissue-restricted autoimmunity, a finding that may explain the association between HDAC7 and hepatobiliary autoimmunity.</description><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006116</link><recrawled>1524170525281</recrawled><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/X_ZyVI2ySQ4/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Nicholas T.

Humans are remarkably adept at generalizing knowledge between experiences in a way that can be difficult for computers. Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models can only re-use policies as a whole and are unable to transfer knowledge about the transition structure of the environment even if only the goal has changed (or vice-versa). This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non-parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions, affording separable transfer of their constituent parts across contexts. We show that the relative performance of this agent compared to an agent that jointly clusters reward and transition functions depends environmental task statistics: the mutual information between transition and reward functions and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and propose a meta learning agent that dynamically arbitrates between strategies across task domains to optimize a statistical tradeoff.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X_ZyVI2ySQ4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>31</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162df187f34:50ab6:a077e55f</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas T.

This study aims to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCa with bioinformatics. Methods: Original gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE64318 and GSE46602 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted differential screens of the expression of genes (DEGs) between two groups using the R software limma package. The interactions between the differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted and merged with the target genes. Co-expression of the miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected to construct the mRNA-miRNA and -lncRNA interaction networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and the transcription factors were annotated. The expression of hub genes in the TCGA datasets was verified to improve the reliability of our analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that 60 miRNAs, 1578 mRNAs and 61 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks were composed of 5 miRNA nodes, 13 lncRNA nodes, and 45 mRNA nodes. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the nuclei and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of transcription, related to sequence-specific DNA binding, and participated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. These pathways are related to cancer and focal adhesion signalling pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs, 6 lncRNAs, 6 mRNAs and 2 TFs play important regulatory roles in the interaction network. The expression levels of EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1, DLG4, TGFBR1 and KIT were significantly different between PCa and normal prostate tissue. Conclusion: Based on the current study, large-scale effects of interrelated mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs were revealed and a model for predicting the mechanism of PCa was provided. This study provides new insight for the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of PCa and valuable clues for further research.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323543v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636a914ef8:44b6aff:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Purpose: Prostate cancer (PCa) causes a common male urinary system malignant tumour, and the molecular mechanisms of PCa remain poorly understood.

Several studies highlighted the relevance of extrinsic noise in shaping cell decision making and differentiation in molecular networks. Bimodal distributions of gene expression levels provide experimental evidence of phenotypic differentiation, where the modes of the distribution often correspond to different physiological states of the system. We theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this interaction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target transcription rate almost no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We investigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a fluctuating miRNA-transcription rate. We find that the presence of extrinsic noise favours the presence of bimodal target distributions which can be observed for a wider range of parameters compared to the case with intrinsic noise only and for lower miRNA-target interaction strength. Our results suggest that combining threshold-inducing interactions with extrinsic noise provides a simple and robust mechanism for obtaining bimodal populations without requiring fine tuning. Furthermore, we characterise the protein distribution’s dependence on protein half-life.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kcCJaIvDnzk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>50</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162d4ba762b:4bed5c:bdf8aaf1</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Del Giudice, Stefano Bo, Silvia Grigolon, Carla Bosia&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with multiple myeloma included in prospective clinical trials are highly selected and therefore are expected not to be representative of the entire patient population. Additionally recommendations based on literature data and randomized trials are not systematically implemented in all patients. We sought to determine how patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma are currently treated in France.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We performed a nation-wide search using the Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d’Information (PMSI) database which includes anonymous data for all patients hospitalized in France. We identified newly diagnosed cases in 2012 and analyzed the number and duration of hospital stays, coexisting conditions and treatment modalities with data available until the end of 2015. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma was determined for the first time during a hospitalization in France in 2012 in 6,282 patients (3,234 males and 3,048 females). The median age at diagnosis was 74 years (72 in males and 76 in females). A majority (55.3%) of patients were diagnosed and treated in a single heath center, including 37% in a university hospital and 52% in a non-university public hospital. Comorbidities potentially impacting on myeloma treatment were present in 57.5% of patients at diagnosis, and 15% had an associated diagnosis of another neoplasia. Intensive therapies with stem cell transplants were performed in 1033 patients (16% of total), the majority of which were aged less than 65 (881 patients, 85.3%). Stem cell transplants were performed more frequently in males while the distance between the site of residence and the transplant center had no impact on likelihood of receiving a transplant. Only 60% of patients less than 65 years old who were treated for their disease underwent intensification with stem cell transplant within the 4-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A large majority of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma are elderly, in particular females, and not eligible for transplants. Among the patients aged less than 65 and receiving therapy for their disease, 40% do not undergo transplants. These data emphasize the need for alternative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196596</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a5f:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charles Dumontet, Sandrine Couray-Targe, Marion Teisseire, Lionel Karlin, Delphine Maucort-Boulch&lt;/p&gt;

In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6d:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;

The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women). Two other trajectories showed a more pronounced decline. Smoking and the presence of respiratory complaints were the best predictors of a trajectory with stronger decline. A greater BMI over the follow-up period was associated with a more unfavorable FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; course both in men (β = -0.027 (SD = 0.002); P &amp;lt; 0.001) and in women (β = -0.008 (SD = 0.001); P &amp;lt; 0.001). Smokers at baseline who quit the habit during follow-up, showed smaller decline in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison to persistent smokers, independent of BMI change (In men β = -0.074 (SD = 0.020); P &amp;lt; 0.001. In women β = -0.277 (SD = 0.068); P &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, three typical trajectories of age-related FEV1 decline could be distinguished. Change in the lifestyle related risk factors, BMI and smoking, significantly impact aging-related decline of lung function. Identifying deviant trajectories may help in early recognition of those at risk of a diagnosis of lung disease later in life.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197250</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7ad:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sandra H. van Oostrom, Peter M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Systems (UAV or UAS) have become increasingly popular in recent years for agricultural research applications. UAS are capable of acquiring images with high spatial and temporal resolutions that are ideal for applications in agriculture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a UAS-based remote sensing system for quantification of crop growth parameters of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) including leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and yield. The study was conducted at the Texas A&amp;amp;M Research Farm near College Station, Texas, United States. A fixed-wing UAS equipped with a multispectral sensor was used to collect image data during the 2016 growing season (April–October). Flight missions were successfully carried out at 50 days after planting (DAP; 25 May), 66 DAP (10 June) and 74 DAP (18 June). These flight missions provided image data covering the middle growth period of sorghum with a spatial resolution of approximately 6.5 cm. Field measurements of LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were also collected. Four vegetation indices were calculated using the UAS images. Among those indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed the highest correlation with LAI, f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and yield with R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values of 0.91, 0.89 and 0.58 respectively. Empirical relationships between NDVI and LAI and between NDVI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were validated and proved to be accurate for estimating LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; from UAS-derived NDVI values. NDVI determined from UAS imagery acquired during the flowering stage (74 DAP) was found to be the most highly correlated with final grain yield. The observed high correlations between UAS-derived NDVI and the crop growth parameters (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, LAI and grain yield) suggests the applicability of UAS for within-season data collection of agricultural crops such as sorghum.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196605</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a60:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sanaz Shafian, Nithya Rajan, Ronnie Schnell, Muthukumar Bagavathiannan, John Valasek, Yeyin Shi, Jeff Olsenholler&lt;/p&gt;

Our method shall be useful for protein docking, protein interaction prediction and protein interaction network construction.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-d?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-d?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.4.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, J.</name></author><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Early warning about emerging contaminants</title><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>f95e79e3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-d?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7cc:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5013302?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5013302?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Hirokazu Kadobayashi</name></author><published>1524635323000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1524900763427</crawled><fingerprint>e5b70b88</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5013302?af=R</originId><title>In situ Raman and X-ray diffraction studies on the high pressure and temperature stability of methane hydrate up to 55 GPa</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1630b2b1723:100d5e5:fc1f8953</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004122</link><recrawled>1526424487605</recrawled><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/feggFvBsPmE/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jianbin Su</name></author><published>1525381200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Active photosynthetic inhibition mediated by MPK3/MPK6 is critical to effector-triggered immunity</title><updated>1525381200000</updated><crawled>1525370092024</crawled><fingerprint>b5552f63</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004122</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jianbin Su, Liuyi Yang, Qiankun Zhu, Hongjiao Wu, Yi He, Yidong Liu, Juan Xu, Dean Jiang, Shuqun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;
Extensive research revealed tremendous details about how plants sense pathogen effectors during effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, less is known about downstream signaling events. In this report, we demonstrate that prolonged activation of MPK3 and MPK6, two &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; pathogen-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), is essential to ETI mediated by both coiled coil-nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (CNLs) and toll/interleukin-1 receptor nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (TNLs) types of R proteins. MPK3/MPK6 activation rapidly alters the expression of photosynthesis-related genes and inhibits photosynthesis, which promotes the accumulation of superoxide (O2•−) and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), two major reactive oxygen species (ROS), in chloroplasts under light. In the chemical-genetically rescued &lt;i&gt;mpk3 mpk6&lt;/i&gt; double mutants, ETI-induced photosynthetic inhibition and chloroplastic ROS accumulation are compromised, which correlates with delayed hypersensitive response (HR) cell death and compromised resistance. Furthermore, protection of chloroplasts by expressing a plastid-targeted cyanobacterial flavodoxin (pFLD) delays photosynthetic inhibition and compromises ETI. Collectively, this study highlights a critical role of MPK3/MPK6 in manipulating plant photosynthetic activities to promote ROS accumulation in chloroplasts and HR cell death, which contributes to the robustness of ETI. Furthermore, the dual functionality of MPK3/MPK6 cascade in promoting defense and inhibiting photosynthesis potentially allow it to orchestrate the trade-off between plant growth and defense in plant immunity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/feggFvBsPmE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>4</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163272479f8:1445:a96d255</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jianbin Su, Liuyi Yang, Qiankun Zhu, Hongjiao Wu, Yi He, Yidong Liu, Juan Xu, Dean Jiang, Shuqun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The conventional method of processing mfVEPs consists of using a 1–35 Hz bandpass frequency filter (X&lt;sub&gt;DFT&lt;/sub&gt;).The EMD algorithm was used to decompose the X&lt;sub&gt;DFT&lt;/sub&gt; signals into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). This signal processing was assessed by computing the amplitudes and latencies of the X&lt;sub&gt;DFT&lt;/sub&gt; and IMF signals (X&lt;sub&gt;EMD&lt;/sub&gt;). The amplitudes from the full visual field and from ring 5 (9.8–15° eccentricity) were studied. The discrimination index was calculated between controls and patients.

How these asymmetric properties are established and maintained during quiescence remains unknown. Here we show that a daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein, Cep120, plays a critical inhibitory role at daughter centrioles. Depletion of Cep120 in quiescent mouse and human cells causes accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) components including Pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, Ninein and Cep170.

How these asymmetric properties are established and maintained during quiescence remains unknown. Here we show that a daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein, Cep120, plays a critical inhibitory role at daughter centrioles. Depletion of Cep120 in quiescent mouse and human cells causes accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) components including Pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, Ninein and Cep170. The elevated PCM levels result in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome. Consequently, loss of Cep120 leads to aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. Our results indicate that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centriole, and defines a potentially new molecular defect underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.</description><engagement>8</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197436</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197436</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Martina Tassinari</name></author><published>1526418000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Rapid diagnosis of bloodstream infections in the critically ill: Evaluation of the broad-range PCR/ESI-MS technology</title><updated>1526418000000</updated><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><fingerprint>ae2ccf24</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197436</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Tassinari, Silvia Zannoli, Patrizia Farabegoli, Maria Federica Pedna, Anna Pierro, Antonio Mastroianni, Riccardo Fontan, Luciano Luongo, Giuseppe Sarnataro, Elisa Menegatti, Assunta Caruso, Vittorio Sambri&lt;/p&gt;
Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours. This might allow a timely administration of a suitable treatment.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197436</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8c:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Tassinari, Silvia Zannoli, Patrizia Farabegoli, Maria Federica Pedna, Anna Pierro, Antonio Mastroianni, Riccardo Fontan, Luciano Luongo, Giuseppe Sarnataro, Elisa Menegatti, Assunta Caruso, Vittorio Sambri&lt;/p&gt;

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42260:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ea:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ruben D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are located in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene, are reported to be associated with body weight and the body mass index (BMI). However, their effects on anthropometric measurements in adolescents are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the association of three adjacent polymorphisms (rs9930506, rs9930501, &amp;amp; rs9932754) in the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene with anthropometric indices in Iranian adolescent males.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The participants comprised a total of 237 adolescent males who were recruited randomly from two high schools in Tehran, Iran. The DNA samples were genotyped for the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms by DNA sequencing. BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), and body muscle percentage (BM%) were determined using a validated bioelectrical impedance analysis scale. The association of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms with weight, height, BMI, BF%, and BM% was investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A haplotype of rs9930506, rs9930501, and rs9932754 (GGT) in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; with complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found to be significantly associated with higher weight (OR = 1.32), BMI (OR = 5.36) and BF% (OR = 1.46), and lower BM% (OR = 3.59) (all P&amp;lt;0.001).

Background &lt;p&gt;Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are located in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene, are reported to be associated with body weight and the body mass index (BMI). However, their effects on anthropometric measurements in adolescents are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the association of three adjacent polymorphisms (rs9930506, rs9930501, &amp;amp; rs9932754) in the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene with anthropometric indices in Iranian adolescent males.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The participants comprised a total of 237 adolescent males who were recruited randomly from two high schools in Tehran, Iran. The DNA samples were genotyped for the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms by DNA sequencing. BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), and body muscle percentage (BM%) were determined using a validated bioelectrical impedance analysis scale. The association of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms with weight, height, BMI, BF%, and BM% was investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A haplotype of rs9930506, rs9930501, and rs9932754 (GGT) in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; with complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found to be significantly associated with higher weight (OR = 1.32), BMI (OR = 5.36) and BF% (OR = 1.46), and lower BM% (OR = 3.59) (all P&amp;lt;0.001). None of the students with GGC genotypes were underweight, while all of the students with AAT genotypes had high muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A haplotype in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene had a strong association with obesity indices in Iranian adolescent males. The &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms might have greater effects on anthropometric indices than what was previously imagined.

We previously introduced an approach for EVD prognosis prediction, using models that can be implemented in the field and updated in light of new data. Here we enhance and validate our methods with the largest published EVD dataset to date. We also present a proof-of-concept medical app that summarizes patient information and offers tailored treatment options using an interactive risk visualization for quick interpretation and decision-making. Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations. This tool may better inform treatment choices in future EVD outbreaks. It also provides a template to validate additional datasets used in developing novel clinical-decision support systems for EVD and other emerging infectious diseases.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162d472bde3:33fd5de:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: The 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak highlighted the need for rigorous, rapid, and field-deployable tools to enable case management.

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of 10,000 or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist in which OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multi-scale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/To91iFbN0F4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>2</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16308305f07:446895:c2c34441</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Famulare, Christian Selinger, Kevin A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In sub-Saharan Africa foodborne disease and foodborne disease outbreaks are frequently ascribed to poor personal hygiene of street food vendors and food handlers in food establishments. Evidence on the level of food hygiene practices and food safety measures among food handlers is required for proper planning and implementation of targeted interventions. In this study, we aimed to determine the level of food hygiene and safety measures among street food vendors and food handlers in food establishments of Dessie Town, Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A community-based cross-sectional study was performed in Dessie town, Ethiopia from December 2013 to June 2014. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and an observational checklist by a trained data collector among 116 food handlers from 116 food establishments and 19 food handlers from 19 street food vendors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to identify the factors significantly associated with good level of food hygiene and safety practices.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Almost three-quarter (72%; 84/116) of food handlers in food establishments had a good level of food hygiene and safety practices compared to nearly half (53%; 10/19) of street food vendors. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Average monthly income of &gt;$21 US (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.2; 95%CI: 1.3–7.7), availability of service training (AOR = 6.7; 95%CI: 1.8–25), wearing a gown during food handling (AOR = 19; 95%CI: 6.8–51) and medical checkup (AOR = 5.2; 95%CI: 2.1–13) were significantly associated with good levels of food hygiene and safety measures.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Comprehensive health education and promotion programs through continuous training on food hygiene and safety, with promotion of wearing gown during food handling, regular medical checkups of food handlers and programs that enhance the monthly income of food handlers are promising strategies for promoting proper food handling practices in Dessie town, Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196919</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aef:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Metadel Adane, Brhanu Teka, Yirga Gismu, Goitom Halefom, Muluneh Ademe&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. Bovine NK-lysins, a type of AMP, have been predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells. Bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides demonstrate antimicrobial activity against various bacterial pathogens, including several involved in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in cattle; however, such studies are yet to be performed with one important contributor to the BRDC, &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Thirty-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the functional region helices 2 and 3 of bovine NK-lysins NK1, NK2A, NK2B, and NK2C were evaluated for killing activity on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Among four peptides, NK2A and NK2C showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested. All four NK-lysin peptides induced rapid plasma membrane depolarization in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; at two concentrations tested.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. Bovine NK-lysins, a type of AMP, have been predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells. Bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides demonstrate antimicrobial activity against various bacterial pathogens, including several involved in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in cattle; however, such studies are yet to be performed with one important contributor to the BRDC, &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Thirty-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the functional region helices 2 and 3 of bovine NK-lysins NK1, NK2A, NK2B, and NK2C were evaluated for killing activity on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Among four peptides, NK2A and NK2C showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested. All four NK-lysin peptides induced rapid plasma membrane depolarization in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; at two concentrations tested. However, based on propidium iodide uptake, only NK2A and NK2C appeared capable of causing structural damage to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; plasma membrane. Confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy further suggested NK-lysin-induced damage to the plasma membrane. Taken together, the findings in this study suggest that plasma membrane depolarization alone was insufficient to induce lethality, but disruption/permeabilization of the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; plasma membrane was the cause of lethality.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0039-1</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/KounnxJXR1I/s41591-018-0039-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Shraddha Chakradhar</name></author><published>1525676400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Sleeper cells</title><crawled>1525727371951</crawled><fingerprint>3b087ce9</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0039-1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleeper cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleeper cells, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0039-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0039-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;New studies question how HIV persists in the body&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/KounnxJXR1I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/relative-r300-703_m1050/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0039-1/MediaObjects/41591_2018_39_Figa_HTML.jpg</url><height>503</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>703</width></visual><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_1633c7022af:2b22e06:3dd877af</id><engagement>3</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleeper cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleeper cells, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0039-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0039-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;New studies question how HIV persists in the body&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/KounnxJXR1I&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0039-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02769</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/M_2QmvgwWB8/acs.jpcb.8b02769</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Falk Hoffmann, Frans A.

Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithms.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XJmM-iMvR90&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>9</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392ba:a077e55f</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael F.

Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reflects cerebral perfusion and tissue oxygen consumption, which decline in some patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or stroke, especially during exercise. Its physiologic basis and clinical significance remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with oxygen transport physiology and known prognostic factors during both rest and exercise in patients with HFrEF or stroke. Thirty-four HFrEF patients, 26 stroke patients, and 17 healthy controls performed an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test using a bicycle ergometer. Integrated near-infrared spectroscopy and automatic gas analysis were used to measure cerebral tissue oxygenation and cardiac and ventilatory parameters. We found that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (rest; peak) were significantly lower in the HFrEF (66.3±13.3%; 63.4±13.8%,) than in the stroke (72.1±4.2%; 72.7±4.5%) and control (73.1±2.8%; 72±3.2%) groups. In the HFrEF group, SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at rest (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;) and peak SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;) were linearly correlated with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), peak oxygen consumption (V˙O2peak), and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; between -0.561 and 0.677, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Stepwise linear regression showed that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide at rest (P&lt;sub&gt;ET&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;), hemoglobin, and mean arterial pressure at rest (MAP&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) (adjusted R = 0.681, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; was mainly affected by peak carbon dioxide production (V˙CO2peak) (adjusted R = 0.653, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in patients with HFrEF. In conclusion, the study delineates the relationship of cerebral saturation and parameters associated with oxygen delivery.

Background &lt;p&gt;Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can produce false positive (FP) results in patients with human African trypanosomiasis and rheumatoid factor (RF), but specificity against other infectious agents and immunological factors is largely unknown. Low diagnostic specificity caused by cross-reactivity may lead to over-estimates of the number of malaria cases and over-use of antimalarial drugs, at the cost of not diagnosing and treating the true underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing Programme was analysed to assess FP rates of 221 RDTs against four infectious agents (Chagas, dengue, Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis) and four immunological factors (anti-nuclear antibody, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), RF and rapid plasma regain). Only RDTs with a FP rate against clean negative samples less than 10% were included. Paired t-tests were used to compare product-specific FP rates on clean negative samples and samples containing non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty (18%) RDTs showed no FP results against any tested infectious agent or immunological factor. In the remaining RDTs significant and clinically relevant increases in FP rates were observed for samples containing HAMA and RF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were significant correlations between product-matched FP rates for RF and HAMA on all RDT test bands (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and FP rates for each infectious agent and immunological factor were also correlated between test bands of combination RDTs (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;≤0.002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;False positive results against non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors does not appear to be a universal property of malaria RDTs. However, since many malaria RDTs have elevated FP rates against HAMA and RF positive samples practitioners may need to consider the possibility of false positive results for malaria in patients with conditions that stimulate HAMA or RF.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197395</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd9:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michelle L.

Nitrogen assimilation and metabolism are essential processes for all living organisms, yet there is still much to be learnt on how they are regulated. The use of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; as a model system has been instrumental not only in identifying conserved regulation mechanisms that control the nitrogen assimilation pathway, but also in understanding how the intracellular nitrogen status regulates metabolic processes of industrial interest such as the synthesis of biolipids. While the genetic regulators that control the nitrogen pathway are successfully being unravelled, other layers of regulation have received less attention. Amino acids, for example, regulate nitrogen assimilation in certain organisms, but their role in Chlamydomonas has not thoroughly been explored. Previous results had suggested that arginine might repress key genes of the nitrogen assimilation pathway by acting within the ammonium negative signalling cascade, upstream of the nitric oxide (NO) inducible guanylate cyclase &lt;i&gt;CYG56&lt;/i&gt;. We tested this hypothesis with a combination of genetic and chemical approaches. Antagonising the effects of arginine with an arginine biosynthesis mutant or with two chemical analogues released gene expression from ammonium mediated repression. The &lt;i&gt;cyg56&lt;/i&gt; and related &lt;i&gt;non1&lt;/i&gt; mutants, which are partially insensitive to ammonium repression, were also partially insensitive to repression by arginine. Finally, we show that the addition of arginine to the medium leads to an increase in intracellular NO. Our data reveal that arginine acts as a negative signal for the assimilation of nitrogen within the ammonium-CYG56 negative signalling cascade, and provide a connection between amino acid metabolism and nitrogen assimilation in microalgae.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196167</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb99:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by David González-Ballester, Emanuel Sanz-Luque, Aurora Galván, Emilio Fernández, Amaury de Montaigu&lt;/p&gt;

In cognitive science, the &amp;quot;universal law of generalization&amp;quot; seeks to explain this ability and states that generalization between stimuli will follow an exponential function of their distance in &amp;quot;psychological space.&amp;quot; Here, I challenge existing theoretical explanations for the universal law and offer an alternative account based on the principle of efficient coding.

Sweat includes active components and metabolites, which are needed to maintain skin homeostasis. Component changes in sweat derived from atopic dermatitis (AD) have been reported. To investigate the influence of sweat components on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed a multifaceted assessment, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolomic analysis, and linked these features to clinical features of AD. Distinctive properties of AD sweat are the quite-variation in protein, anti-microbial peptides and glucose concentrations. pH, sodium, and other salt levels in sweat of AD were comparable to that of healthy subjects. Sweat from AD patients with acute inflammation had a more prominent increase in glucose concentration than sweat from healthy individuals or those with AD with chronic inflammation. Topical glucose application delayed recovery of transepidermal water loss in barrier-disrupted mice. Furthermore, the glucose transporter GLUT2 was highly expressed in the lumen of sweat glands from AD patients. AD patients with chronic inflammation had significantly increased &lt;i&gt;GLUT2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression and near normal sweat glucose levels. Despite the small sample size in our study, we speculate that the increased glucose levels might be affected by AD severity and phenotype. We hope that this report will bring novel insight into the impact of sweat components on the clinical manifestation of AD.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195960</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fb:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emi Ono, Hiroyuki Murota, Yuki Mori, Yoshichika Yoshioka, Yuko Nomura, Takichi Munetsugu, Hiroo Yokozeki, Ichiro Katayama&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Calcifications within the hippocampus were recently described for the first time on computed tomography (CT). These calcifications appeared in patients older than 50 years, the prevalence increases with age and they may be associated with cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the histological basis (the presence, severity and location) of these CT-detected hippocampal calcifications of post-mortem brains.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;CT scans of seven post-mortem brains were scored for the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of hippocampal calcification. After this, samples from nine hippocampi (bilateral in two brains, unilateral in five brains) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to indicate the cytoarchitecture, with Elastica van Gieson to analyse the elastic connective tissue of the vessel walls and with von Kossa for detection of calcium.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In four brains (six hippocampi), calcifications were both found on CT and in corresponding histology. In three brains (three hippocampi), calcifications were absent on CT and corresponding histology. In histology, mild calcifications were located in the tail and severe calcifications involved the tail, body and sometimes the head of the hippocampus. The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197073</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f73:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa E.

These ultraconfined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>13</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197627</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197627</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Nuno Gonçalo Ferreira Cordeiro</name></author><published>1526590800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Transient response of the Northwestern Iberian upwelling regime</title><updated>1526590800000</updated><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><fingerprint>f9c55cf9</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197627</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nuno Gonçalo Ferreira Cordeiro, Jesus Dubert, Rita Nolasco, Eric Desmond Barton&lt;/p&gt;
The hydrography and dynamics of NW Iberian margin were explored for July 2009, based on a set of in situ and remote sensing observations. Zonal sections of standard CTD casts, towed CTD (SeaSoar), Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and Lagrangian surveys were made to characterize cycles of upwelling and relaxation in this region. Two periods of northerly winds, bounded by relaxation periods, were responsible for the formation of an upwelling front extending to the shelf edge. An equatorward flow was quickly set up on the shelf responding to the northerly wind pulses. South of Cape Silleiro, the development and subsequent relaxation of an upwelling event was intensively surveyed in the shelf, following a Lagrangian drifter transported by the upwelling jet. This region is part of an upwelling center extending from Cape Silleiro to Porto, where the surface temperature was colder than the neighboring regions, under upwelling favorable winds. As these winds relaxed, persistent poleward flow developed, originating south of the upwelling center and consisting in an inner-shelf tongue of warm waters. During an event of strong southerly wind, the poleward flow was observed to extend to the whole continental shelf. Although the cruise was executed during summertime, the presence of river-plumes was observed over the shelf. The interaction of the plumes with the circulation on the shelf was also described in terms of coastal convergence and offshore advection. The sampling of the offshore and slope regions showed the presence of the Iberian poleward current offshore and a persistent equatorward flow over the upper slope.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197627</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85438:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nuno Gonçalo Ferreira Cordeiro, Jesus Dubert, Rita Nolasco, Eric Desmond Barton&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient’s life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (post-treatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48). Compliance rate was 69% and total dropout rate was 28%, both primarily related to disease progression and death.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;LRT-MST seems effective among cancer patients in palliative care to improve the course of ego-integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197277</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7c:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gitta Kleijn, Birgit I.

The use of model-based propensity scores as matching tools opens the way to the indirect estimation of mode-related measurement effects and selection effects in web surveys, including a component of selection that cannot be traced back to observable characteristics. By matching and comparing respondents from real independent surveys that use the same questionnaire, but different administration modes, it becomes possible to isolate the selection effect induced by unobservable (or unobserved) respondent characteristics. This study applies a stratification matching algorithm to compare a web survey from a proprietary panel with a computer-assisted telephone survey based on random digit-dialing. The experiment is run in two countries (UK and Italy) to check for consistencies across different cultures and different internet penetration rates. The application to the elicitation of support for healthy eating policies indicates large and significant measurement and selection effects. After controlling for differences in the observed characteristics of respondents and the intensity of internet use, findings suggest that web surveys record lower support and higher neutrality. Similarly, after controlling for administration mode and observed respondent characteristics, internet users are less likely to state support compared to non-users.

The use of model-based propensity scores as matching tools opens the way to the indirect estimation of mode-related measurement effects and selection effects in web surveys, including a component of selection that cannot be traced back to observable characteristics. By matching and comparing respondents from real independent surveys that use the same questionnaire, but different administration modes, it becomes possible to isolate the selection effect induced by unobservable (or unobserved) respondent characteristics. This study applies a stratification matching algorithm to compare a web survey from a proprietary panel with a computer-assisted telephone survey based on random digit-dialing. The experiment is run in two countries (UK and Italy) to check for consistencies across different cultures and different internet penetration rates. The application to the elicitation of support for healthy eating policies indicates large and significant measurement and selection effects. After controlling for differences in the observed characteristics of respondents and the intensity of internet use, findings suggest that web surveys record lower support and higher neutrality. Similarly, after controlling for administration mode and observed respondent characteristics, internet users are less likely to state support compared to non-users. This suggests that unobserved characteristics play a major role, and post-stratification weighting is not a sufficient countermeasure. As demonstrated by the cross-country comparison, rising internet penetration rates are not a guarantee against this type of error, as disparities in these unobserved characteristics are likely to increase at the same time.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28477</link><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/28477</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>MCRISCITIELLO@CVM.TAMU.EDU (Caitlin D Castro)</name></author><published>1523923200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Since the discovery of the T cell receptor (TcR), immunologists have assigned somatic hypermutation (SHM) as a mechanism employed solely by B cells to diversify their antigen receptors.

The cutaneous silent period is an inhibitory evoked response that demonstrates a wide variety of responses in muscles of the human upper limb. Classically, the cutaneous silent period results in a characteristic muscle pattern of extensor inhibition and flexor facilitation within the upper limb, in the presence of nociceptive input. The aims of the current study were: 1) to primarily investigate the presence and characteristics of the cutaneous silent period response across multiple extensor and flexor muscles of the upper limb, and 2) to secondarily investigate the influence of stimulation site on this nociceptive reflex response. It was hypothesized that the cutaneous silent period would be present in all muscles, regardless of role (flexion/extension) or the stimulation site. Twenty-two healthy, university-age adults (14 males; 8 females; 23 ± 5 yrs) participated in the study. Testing consisted of three different stimulation sites (Digit II, V, and II+III nociceptive stimulation) during a low intensity, sustained muscle contraction, in which, 7 upper limb muscles were monitored via surface EMG recording electrodes. Distal muscles of the upper limb presented with the earliest reflex onset times, longest reflex duration, and lowest level of EMG suppression when compared to the more proximal muscles, regardless of extensor/flexor role. Additionally, the greatest overall inhibitory influence was expressed within the distal muscles. In conclusion, the present study provides a new level of refinement within the current understanding of the spinal organization associated with nociceptive input processing and the associated motor control of the upper limb. Subsequently, these results have further implications on the impact of nociception on supraspinal processing.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196129</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b2:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathanial R.

Upon their translocation into the mitochondrial matrix, the N-terminal pre-sequence of nuclear-encoded proteins undergoes cleavage by mitochondrial processing peptidases. Some proteins require more than a single processing step, which involves several peptidases. Down-regulation of the putative &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP) homolog by RNAi renders the cells unable to grow after 48 hours of induction. Ablation of MIP results in the accumulation of the precursor of the trypanosomatid-specific trCOIV protein, the largest nuclear-encoded subunit of the cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase complex in this flagellate. However, the trCOIV precursor of the same size accumulates also in trypanosomes in which either alpha or beta subunits of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) have been depleted. Using a chimeric protein that consists of the N-terminal sequence of a putative subunit of respiratory complex I fused to a yellow fluorescent protein, we assessed the accumulation of the precursor protein in trypanosomes, in which RNAi was induced against the alpha or beta subunits of MPP or MIP. The observed accumulation of precursors indicates MIP depletion affects the activity of the cannonical MPP, or at least one of its subunits.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196474</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae74:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Priscila Peña-Diaz, Jan Mach, Eva Kriegová, Pavel Poliak, Jan Tachezy, Julius Lukeš&lt;/p&gt;

We spend a lot of time thinking about proteins in terms of their primary sequence and features of their three-dimensional structure (binding pockets, recognition domains, etc.) And that’s understandable. But it’s always important not to lose sight of the fact that the surfaces of proteins are decorated with all kinds of ornaments that are vital for their function, even if they’re synthetically hard to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief among those are phosphates, you’d have to say. Kinases, of course, phosphorylate things and phosphatases take those back off (and as is often the case in biology, those two classes of enzymes are rather unbalanced: there are a lot more specific kinases out there, compared to a relatively small number of jack-of-all-trades phosphatases). Phosphorylation state can be a powerful on/off switch on specific protein residues, but it’s worth remembering that proteins can have a whole long list of phosphoryation sites once you get past the heavy-duty ones. The number of kinase inhibitors out there is proof enough that this method of regulating protein function can be taken advantage of, but it’s worth keeping in mind that making specifically phosphorylated proteins can be a painful process if you don’t have a living cell or at least a tame enzyme to do it for you. That’s particularly true if you’re interested in one of the less-common phosphorylation sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have a very different sort of polarity modification, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation&quot;&gt;prenylation&lt;/a&gt;. Farnesyl (or geranyl-geranyl) groups are small lipophilic chains that get attached to proteins to modify their function and/or cellular localization. Proteins also get decorated with even longer lipid chains via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitoylation&quot;&gt;palmitoylation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myristoylation&quot;&gt;myristoylation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed that these are generally involved in localizing things to membrane sites (as those greasy side chains settle into the lipid membrane). What’s for sure is that these modifications can make proteins rather tricky to work with (as is generally the case when you have a big polar/nonpolar structural separation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that you get to the proteins-modified-with-other-proteins class, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitination&lt;/a&gt; at the head of that class. Ubiquitin, as the name implies, is all over the place, and proteins get ubiquitinated (at lysine residues) to mark them for degradation, to mark them not to be degraded, to change their localization and interaction networks, and for who knows what else. It’s a huge topic, since there are lots of varieties of ubiquitin attachment, and if you think we’ve got them all figured out you are sadly mistaken. Then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUMO_protein&quot;&gt;SUMOylation&lt;/a&gt;, another add-a-small-protein process that’s clearly important but which we understand even less. It’s less common than ubiquitination (we think!), but there are several different sorts of SUMO proteins and places that they can be attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m skipping over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification&quot;&gt;several other&lt;/a&gt; post-translational modifications to get to a big class of them that I haven’t mentioned yet: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation&quot;&gt;glycosylations&lt;/a&gt;. Sugar molecules (and chains of them) are stapled on to residues like tyrosine, starting with good old glucose and going on from there. These things can also be linked through amine and sometimes even SH residues, and that is just the beginning. I did my graduate work using carbohydrates as starting materials for organic synthesis, and anyone who’s worked with them will have some appreciation of the complications that are available. With all those open hydroxyls available, carbohydrates have a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside&quot;&gt;linking possibilities&lt;/a&gt; (some more common than others, naturally), and you have the alpha/beta anomeric centers for variety as well. Two naturally occurring amino acids can give you four peptides, but two naturally occurring sugars can give you a whole lot more disaccharides, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modifications are hugely important in proteins and many other biomolecules (including small-molecule natural products), but when I was in grad school, a lot of this was, chemically and biologically speaking, dark matter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK453015/&quot;&gt;A lot of it&lt;/a&gt; still is. Sometimes people would prefer just to ignor that part – even now, you’ll see total syntheses of some natural product as “whateverol aglycon”, that is, minus those pesky sugars. And when it comes to proteins, you almost have to rely on a living cell to glycosylate them properly, because chemically it can be a beast. A lot of chemical glycosylations are variations on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koenigs%E2%80%93Knorr_reaction&quot;&gt;Koenigs-Knorr&lt;/a&gt; reaction, with glycosyl halides, pseudohalides, and other leaving groups, and the number of variations on this is surely beyond counting. Holy cow, are there ever a lot of attempts to make glycosylation a better and more predictable reaction. My old “Lowe’s Laws of the Lab List” had one that went “&lt;em&gt;When there are twenty different ways of running a reaction in the literature, it means that there is no good way to run the reaction&lt;/em&gt;“, and the Koenigs-Knorr was what I had in mind. But it’s true: every time you vary the substrate being glycosylated or mess with the structure of the sugar part in any way, you can expect to see a new mixture of alpha/beta glycosides at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper I linked to so many paragraphs ago is a good shot, though, at taming this stuff for plain glucose-style glycosylation. The authors have a glycosyl fluoride protocol worked out (calcium hydroxide turns out to be a key addition) that seems to give pretty solid results on tyrosines (and phenols in general). What’s really impressive is that it works under aqueous conditions, using an unprotected sugar, and works on native (unprotected) proteins and peptides. It’s not perfect – you still get some glycosylation on other residues (serine, etc.), but it’s certainly the best I’ve ever seen. It would be interesting to see what happens when you try it on a protein with several possible tyrosines or with competing Cys residues, and I get the impression that the authors are heading there next. But even as it stands, this looks like a significantly better option than anything else out there for fast one-step glycosylation without messing around with protecting groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorts of tools that are available for synthesizing, manipulating, and analyzing proteins and nucleic acids are (in general) just not available for carbohydrates. They either don’t exist anywhere or haven’t been domesticated from their biochemical forms. Only in recent years has the dream of automated polysaccharide synthesis come close &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3385&quot;&gt;to reality&lt;/a&gt;. Even in this paper, it’s worth noting that the authors weren’t really able to tell what all those other minor glycosylated side products were; it would be a major effort to run all those down. But this stuff is important, and every new technique that makes it easier to work in the area is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>23</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Unseok Lee</name></author><published>1524862800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>An automated, high-throughput plant phenotyping system using machine learning-based plant segmentation and image analysis</title><updated>1524862800000</updated><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><fingerprint>b61e9019</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Unseok Lee, Sungyul Chang, Gian Anantrio Putra, Hyoungseok Kim, Dong Hwan Kim&lt;/p&gt;
A high-throughput plant phenotyping system automatically observes and grows many plant samples. Many plant sample images are acquired by the system to determine the characteristics of the plants (populations). Stable image acquisition and processing is very important to accurately determine the characteristics. However, hardware for acquiring plant images rapidly and stably, while minimizing plant stress, is lacking. Moreover, most software cannot adequately handle large-scale plant imaging. To address these problems, we developed a new, automated, high-throughput plant phenotyping system using simple and robust hardware, and an automated plant-imaging-analysis pipeline consisting of machine-learning-based plant segmentation. Our hardware acquires images reliably and quickly and minimizes plant stress. Furthermore, the images are processed automatically. In particular, large-scale plant-image datasets can be segmented precisely using a classifier developed using a superpixel-based machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest), and variations in plant parameters (such as area) over time can be assessed using the segmented images. We performed comparative evaluations to identify an appropriate learning algorithm for our proposed system, and tested three robust learning algorithms. We developed not only an automatic analysis pipeline but also a convenient means of plant-growth analysis that provides a learning data interface and visualization of plant growth trends. Thus, our system allows end-users such as plant biologists to analyze plant growth via large-scale plant image data easily.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196615</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d755:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Unseok Lee, Sungyul Chang, Gian Anantrio Putra, Hyoungseok Kim, Dong Hwan Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the “emerging” mycotoxins, which are produced by various &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1. Thus, both compounds can reach the brain parenchyma where neurotoxic effects cannot be ruled out.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197406</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b6:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Isabel Krug, Matthias Behrens, Melanie Esselen, Hans-Ulrich Humpf&lt;/p&gt;

Serum starvation is a routine protocol for synchronizing nuclear donor cells to G0/G1 phase during somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, abrupt serum deprivation can cause serious stress to the cells cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, which might result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, chromosome damage, and finally reduce the success rate of SCNT. In the present study, the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an effective ER stress-relieving drug, on the nuclear donor cells under serum deprivation condition as well as following SCNT procedures were first assessed in the bovine. The results showed that TUDCA significantly reduced ER stress and cell apoptosis in those nuclear donor cells. Moreover, it significantly decreased the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt;, and increased the level of H3K9 acetylation in nuclear donor cells compared with control group. SCNT reconstructed embryos cloned from TUDCA-treated donor cells showed significantly higher fusion, cleavage, blastocyst formation rate, total cell number in day 7 blastocysts, and lower apoptotic index than that from control group. In addition, the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bax&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in blastocysts derived from TUDCA-treated donor cells than that from control group.

Quality control (QC) is an essential stage during analytic pipelines and can be found in the outputs of popular bioinformatics tools such as FastQC and Picard. Although these tools provide considerable power when carrying out QC, large sample numbers can make identification of systemic bias a challenge. Results: We present ngsReports, an R package designed for the management and visualization of NGS reports from within an R environment. The available methods allow direct import into R of FastQC output as well as that from aligners such as HISAT2, STAR and Bowtie2. Visualization can be carried out across many samples using heatmaps rendered using ggplot2 and plotly. Moreover, these can be displayed in an interactive shiny app or a HTML report. We also provide methods to assess observed GC content in an organism dependent manner for both transcriptomic and genomic datasets. Importantly, hierarchical clustering can be carried out on heatmaps with large sample sizes to quickly identify outliers and batch effects.

In anaplastic thyroid cancer C643 cells, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) attenuates migration by activating the S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor and the Rho-ROCK pathway. In the present study, we show that stimulating C643 cells with S1P decreases the expression, secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and to a lesser extent MMP9. Using receptor-specific antagonists, and S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; siRNA, we showed that the inhibition of expression of MMP2 is mediated through S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, S1P inhibited calpain activity, and inhibiting calpain pharmacologically, inhibited the effect of S1P on MMP2 expression and activity, and on MMP9 activity. S1P treatment increased Rho activity, and by incubating cells with the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase or the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, the S1P-induced inhibition of invasion and MMP2 expression and activity was abolished. We conclude that S1P attenuates the invasion of C643 cells by activating S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the Rho-ROCK pathway, by decreasing calpain activity, and by decreasing the expression, secretion and activity of MMP2 and, to a lesser extent, MMP9. Our results thus unveil a novel function for the S1P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in attenuating thyroid cancer cell invasion.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196992</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42263:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Yasir Asghar, Kati Kemppainen, Taru Lassila, Kid Törnquist&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Polypharmacy is common in older patients but relationships between polypharmacy and common co-morbid conditions have not been elucidated. Our goal was to determine relationships between daily oral medication use and common co-morbid disease dyads and triads using comprehensive medication and diagnostic data from a national sample of nursing homes (NH).&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Retrospective, cross-sectional study.&lt;/p&gt; Setting &lt;p&gt;Nationally representative sample of U.S. Nursing Homes.&lt;/p&gt; Participants &lt;p&gt;Nationally representative sample of long-term stay residents (n = 11734, 75% women) aged 65 years or older.&lt;/p&gt; Measurements &lt;p&gt;Diagnosis and medication data were analyzed. Proportion of daily oral medication intake attributed to treatment of common two-(dyads) and three-disease (triad) combinations and “health maintenance” agents (vitamins, dietary supplements, stool softeners without related diagnoses) was determined.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Older NH residents received slightly &gt;8 oral medications/day with the number related to number of medical diagnoses (p &amp;lt; .0001). One third of chronic oral medication intake/day (excluding health maintenance agents) could be attributed to dyad combinations and about half to triad combinations despite an average of 5 other diagnoses. Triads were comprised of hypertension +/- arthritis +/- vascular disease, +/-depression, +/- osteoporosis +/- gastroesophageal reflux disease and +/- diabetes. Health maintenance agents accounted for 15–17% of daily oral medication intake (1.4 medications) such that almost two-thirds of daily oral medications were attributable to disease triads plus health maintenance.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged in Aruba for the first time in 2014. We studied the clinical presentation of acute CHIKV infection and the contribution of serologic and molecular assays to its diagnosis. In a cohort of confirmed CHIKV cases, we analysed the frequency, duration and predictors of post-chikungunya chronic polyarthralgia (pCHIK-CPA), defined as joint pains lasting longer than 6 weeks or longer than 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Patient sera obtained within 10 days of symptom onset were tested for CHIKV, using an indirect immunofluorescence test for the detection of CHIKV-specific Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and post-hoc, by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CHIKV was isolated from selected samples and genotyped. For confirmed CHIKV cases, clinical data from chart review were complemented by a Telephone survey, conducted 18–24 months after diagnosis. When joint pain was reported, the duration, presence of inflammatory signs, type and number of joints affected, were recorded. Joint involvement was scored according to the 2010 ‘American College of Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism’ criteria for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (ACR-score). Risk factors for pCHIK-CPA were identified by logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt; Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Acute CHIKV infection was diagnosed in 269 of 498 sera, by detection of IgM (n = 105), by RT-PCR (n = 59), or by both methods (n = 105). Asian genotype was confirmed in 7 samples. Clinical data were complete for 171 of 248 (69.0%) patients, aged 15 years or older (median 49.4 [35.0–59.6]). The female-to-male ratio was 2.2. The main acute symptoms were arthralgia (94%), fever (85%), myalgia (85%), headache (73%) and rash (63%). In patients with arthralgia (n = 160), pCHIK-CPA longer than 6 weeks was reported by 44% and longer than 1 year by 26% of cases. Inflammatory signs, stiffness, edema and redness were frequent (71%, 39% and 21%, respectively). Joints involved were knees (66%), ankles (50%), fingers (52%), feet (46%), shoulders (36%), elbows (34%), wrists (35%), hips (31%), toes (28.1%) and spine (28.1%). Independent predictors of pCHIK-CPA longer than 1 year were female gender (OR 5.9, 95%-CI [2.1–19.6]); high ACR-score (7.4, [2.7–23.3]), and detection of CHIKV-RNA in serum beyond 7 days of symptom onset (6.4, [1.4–34.1].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We identified 269 CHIKV patients after the first outbreak of Asian genotype CHIKV in Aruba in 2014–2015. RT-PCR yielded 59 (28%) additional CHIKV diagnoses compared to IgM antibody detection alone. Arthralgia, fever and skin rash were the dominant acute phase symptoms. pCHIK-CPA longer than 1 year affected 26% of cases and was predicted by female gender, high ACR-score and CHIKV-RNA detection beyond 7 days of symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196630</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e57:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ralph Huits, Jaclyn De Kort, Riemsdijk Van Den Berg, Luis Chong, Achilleas Tsoumanis, Kaat Eggermont, Koen Bartholomeeusen, Kevin K.

In a cohort of confirmed CHIKV cases, we analysed the frequency, duration and predictors of post-chikungunya chronic polyarthralgia (pCHIK-CPA), defined as joint pains lasting longer than 6 weeks or longer than 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Patient sera obtained within 10 days of symptom onset were tested for CHIKV, using an indirect immunofluorescence test for the detection of CHIKV-specific Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and post-hoc, by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CHIKV was isolated from selected samples and genotyped. For confirmed CHIKV cases, clinical data from chart review were complemented by a Telephone survey, conducted 18–24 months after diagnosis. When joint pain was reported, the duration, presence of inflammatory signs, type and number of joints affected, were recorded. Joint involvement was scored according to the 2010 ‘American College of Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism’ criteria for seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (ACR-score). Risk factors for pCHIK-CPA were identified by logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt; Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Acute CHIKV infection was diagnosed in 269 of 498 sera, by detection of IgM (n = 105), by RT-PCR (n = 59), or by both methods (n = 105). Asian genotype was confirmed in 7 samples. Clinical data were complete for 171 of 248 (69.0%) patients, aged 15 years or older (median 49.4 [35.0–59.6]). The female-to-male ratio was 2.2. The main acute symptoms were arthralgia (94%), fever (85%), myalgia (85%), headache (73%) and rash (63%). In patients with arthralgia (n = 160), pCHIK-CPA longer than 6 weeks was reported by 44% and longer than 1 year by 26% of cases. Inflammatory signs, stiffness, edema and redness were frequent (71%, 39% and 21%, respectively). Joints involved were knees (66%), ankles (50%), fingers (52%), feet (46%), shoulders (36%), elbows (34%), wrists (35%), hips (31%), toes (28.1%) and spine (28.1%). Independent predictors of pCHIK-CPA longer than 1 year were female gender (OR 5.9, 95%-CI [2.1–19.6]); high ACR-score (7.4, [2.7–23.3]), and detection of CHIKV-RNA in serum beyond 7 days of symptom onset (6.4, [1.4–34.1].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We identified 269 CHIKV patients after the first outbreak of Asian genotype CHIKV in Aruba in 2014–2015. RT-PCR yielded 59 (28%) additional CHIKV diagnoses compared to IgM antibody detection alone. Arthralgia, fever and skin rash were the dominant acute phase symptoms. pCHIK-CPA longer than 1 year affected 26% of cases and was predicted by female gender, high ACR-score and CHIKV-RNA detection beyond 7 days of symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25230?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25230?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>LauraLutz‐Kappelman

Anonymized electronic medical records are an increasingly popular source of research data. However, these datasets often lack race and ethnicity information. This creates problems for researchers modeling human disease, as race and ethnicity are powerful confounders for many health exposures and treatment outcomes; race and ethnicity are closely linked to population-specific genetic variation. We showed that deep neural networks generate more accurate estimates for missing racial and ethnic information than competing methods (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and gradient-boosted decision trees). RIDDLE yielded significantly better classification performance across all metrics that were considered: accuracy, cross-entropy loss (error), precision, recall, and area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic plots (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). We made specific efforts to interpret the trained neural network models to identify, quantify, and visualize medical features which are predictive of race and ethnicity. We used these characterizations of informative features to perform a systematic comparison of differential disease patterns by race and ethnicity. The fact that clinical histories are informative for imputing race and ethnicity could reflect (1) a skewed distribution of blue- and white-collar professions across racial and ethnic groups, (2) uneven accessibility and subjective importance of prophylactic health, (3) possible variation in lifestyle, such as dietary habits, and (4) differences in background genetic variation which predispose to diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4S7ZYbUulAk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>74</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163032286b6:a8a5c:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ji-Sung Kim, Xin Gao, Andrey Rzhetsky&lt;/p&gt;

Enzymatic functionalization of cross-β structured protein nanofibrils has hitherto resulted in a severe reduction of the catalytic efficiency of high turnover biocatalysts. It has been speculated that steric restrictions and mass transport pose limits on the attached enzymes, but detailed kinetics analyzing this have not yet been reported. For a more comprehensive understanding, we studied protein nanofibrils endowed with TEM1, a β-lactamase from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. The packing density of TEM1 along the fibrils was controlled by co-fibrillation; in other words, the N-terminal ureidosuccinate transporter Ure2(1–80) from &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; was simultaneously aggregated with the chimeric proteins TEM1-Ure2(1–80). The mature fibrils were trapped in a column, and the rate of ampicillin hydrolysis was recorded using a continuous substrate flow. The turnover rate was plotted as a function of substrate molecules available per enzyme per second, which demonstrated that an elevated substrate availability counteracts mass transport limitations. To analyze this data set, we derived a kinetic model, which makes it possible to easily characterize and compare enzymes packed in columns. The functional TEM1 nanofibrils possess 80% of the catalytic turnover rate compared to free TEM1 in solution. Altogether, we have created protein nanofibrils that can effectively hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotic contaminations and provided a groundwork strategy for other highly functional enzymatic nanofibrils.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196250</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba0:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schmuck, Mats Sandgren, Torleif Härd&lt;/p&gt;

Psychological factors including pain catastrophizing and resilience associate with adjustment and quality of life in people living with chronic pain. Nevertheless, their presentation among females living with HIV and chronic pain has been poorly studied. Given that chronic pain in those living with HIV might occur due to different mechanisms (nociceptive or neuropathic), we hypothesize that the associated psychological states could also differ between these groups. We aimed to compare pain frequency and interference, psychological factors and sleep quality between females living with chronic nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Also, we explored correlations between psychological factors, pain severity and interference in females living with HIV and chronic pain. We performed a cross sectional study assessing females living with HIV and chronic pain, and compared it with a female HIV-positive, pain-free control sample in Brazil. To discriminate the most likely underlying mechanism for the chronic pain, we applied the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms (LANSS). Forty-nine females living with HIV and chronic pain were assessed, and divided in control (n = 12), nociceptive (n = 10) and neuropathic pain (n = 27) groups. Using validated scales, their pain catastrophizing, resilience, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders were assessed between May 2014 and August 2015. Compared to controls, females living with HIV and neuropathic chronic pain had higher pain frequency (p&amp;lt;0.001), interference on activities (p = 0.002), interference with emotions (p&amp;lt;0.001), catastrophizing (p&amp;lt;0.001), depression (p = 0.015), and lower resilience (p = 0.011). Catastrophizing was also significantly correlated to the burden of chronic pain. The type of chronic pain in females living with HIV should raise concerns regarding significant burden in psychological states in this population (particularly neuropathic pain). Using scales such as the LANSS to identify the type of choric pain, could be of use to address relevant issues for the patients, and to propose tailored therapies.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196718</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a187:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andressa de Souza, Wolnei Caumo, Prisla Ucker Calvetti, Rachel Nunes Lorenzoni, Gisele Keller da Rosa, Alexandre Ramos Lazzarotto, Jairo Alberto Dussan-Sarria&lt;/p&gt;

Freshwater reservoir offsets (FROs) occur when AMS dates on charred, encrusted food residues on pottery predate a pot’s chronological context because of the presence of ancient carbon from aquatic resources such as fish. Research over the past two decades has demonstrated that FROs vary widely within and between water bodies and between fish in those water bodies. Lipid analyses have identified aquatic biomarkers that can be extracted from cooking residues as potential evidence for FROs. However, lacking has been efforts to determine empirically how much fish with FROs needs to be cooked in a pot with other resources to result in significant FRO on encrusted cooking residue and what percentage of fish C in a residue is needed to result in the recovery of aquatic biomarkers. Here we provide preliminary assessments of both issues. Our results indicate that in historically-contingent, high alkalinity environments &amp;lt;20% C from fish may result in a statistically significant FRO, but that biomarkers for aquatic resources may be present in the absence of a significant FRO.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196407</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67c2:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by John P.

Background &lt;p&gt;While there is strong evidence showing the survival advantage of elite athletes, much less is known about those engaged in mind sports such as chess. This study aimed to examine the overall as well as regional survival of International Chess Grandmasters (GMs) with a reference to the general population, and compare relative survival (RS) of GMs with that of Olympic medallists (OMs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Information on 1,208 GMs and 15,157 OMs, respectively, from 28 countries were extracted from the publicly available data sources. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rates of the GMs. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust the survival for region, year at risk, age at risk and sex, and to estimate the life expectancy of the GMs. The RS rate was computed by matching each GM or OM by year at risk, age at risk and sex to the life table of the country the individual represented.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The survival rates of GMs at 30 and 60 years since GM title achievement were 87% and 15%, respectively. The life expectancy of GMs at the age of 30 years (which is near the average age when they attained a GM title) was 53.6 ([95% CI]: 47.7–58.5) years, which is significantly greater than the overall weighted mean life expectancy of 45.9 years for the general population. Compared to Eastern Europe, GMs in North America (HR [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.29–0.88]) and Western Europe (HR [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.34–0.83]) had a longer lifespan. The RS analysis showed that both GMs and OMs had a significant survival advantage over the general population, and there was no statistically significant difference in the RS of GMs (RS [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.08–1.20]) compared to OMs: (RS [95% CI]: 1.09 [1.07–1.11]) at 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Elite chess players live longer than the general population and have a similar survival advantage to elite competitors in physical sports.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af1:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by An Tran-Duy, David C.

The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J_BWXr6Snsg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1632c3ea1f7:66cd2:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Aspart, Michiel W.

The highly similar prokaryotic DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (C5-MTases) M.MpeI and M.SssI share the specificity of eukaryotic C5-MTases (5’-CG), and can be useful research tools in the study of eukaryotic DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation. In an effort to improve the stability and solubility of complementing fragments of the two MTases, genes encoding circularly permuted (CP) variants of M.MpeI and M.SssI were created, and cloned in a plasmid vector downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter. MTase activity of the CP variants was tested by digestion of the plasmids with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Eleven of the fourteen M.MpeI permutants and six of the seven M.SssI permutants had detectable MTase activity as indicated by the full or partial protection of the plasmid carrying the cpMTase gene. Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197232</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915b:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pál Albert, Bence Varga, Nikolett Zsibrita, Antal Kiss&lt;/p&gt;

Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is the complex homeostatic regulatory relationship between blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). This study aimed to analyze the frequency-specific coupling function between cerebral oxyhemoglobin concentrations (delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) signals based on a model of coupled phase oscillators and dynamical Bayesian inference. Delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] was measured by 24-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and arterial BP signals were obtained by simultaneous resting-state measurements in patients with stroke, that is, 9 with left hemiparesis (L–H group), 8 with right hemiparesis (R–H group), and 17 age-matched healthy individuals as control (healthy group). The coupling functions from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] oscillators were identified and analyzed in four frequency intervals (I, 0.6–2 Hz; II, 0.145–0.6 Hz; III, 0.052–0.145 Hz; and IV, 0.021–0.052 Hz). In L–H group, the CS from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in interval III in channel 8 was significantly higher than that in healthy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). Compared with the healthy controls, the coupling in MAP→delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] showed higher amplitude in interval I and IV in patients with stroke. The increased CS and coupling amplitude may be an evidence of impairment in CA, thereby confirming the presence of impaired CA in patients with stroke. In interval III, the CS in L–H group from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in channel 16 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) was significantly lower than that in healthy controls, which might indicate the compensatory mechanism in CA of the unaffected side in patients with stroke. No significant difference in region-wise CS between affected and unaffected sides was observed in stroke groups, indicating an evidence of globally impaired CA. These findings provide a method for the assessment of CA and will contribute to the development of therapeutic interventions in stroke patients.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195936</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccbb:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Honglun Su, Congcong Huo, Bitian Wang, Wenhao Li, Gongcheng Xu, Qianying Liu, Zengyong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Recent studies have concluded that native and invasive species share a common set of trait relationships. However, native species in isolated regions might be functionally constrained by their unique evolutionary histories such that they follow different carbon capture strategies than introduced species. We compared leaf traits relating to resource investment, carbon return, and resource-use efficiency in 16 native (endemic) and three non-native (invasive) species in a temperate forest in Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand. Trait differences were more closely associated with leaf habit than nativity. Deciduous species (including invaders) exhibited greater maximum photosynthetic rates at similar resource costs, which resulted in greater nitrogen- and energy-use efficiencies than evergreen natives. Leaf area was the only trait that differed significantly by nativity (over two-fold larger in invaders). Invaders and deciduous natives both occupied the ‘fast return’ end of the leaf economics spectrum in contrast to the native evergreens which had comparatively slow return on investment. Dominant woody invaders in this forest are physiologically distinct from many New Zealand endemic species, which are overwhelmingly evergreen. It remains unclear whether these trait differences translate to an ecological divergence in plant strategy, but these results suggest that ecophysiological tradeoffs are likely constrained by biogeography.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196746</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a18c:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

To exploit the plethora of information provided by Next Generation Sequencing, the identification of the genetic mutations responsible for disease in general or cancer in particular, among the thousands of neutral germline or somatic variations is a crucial task. Genome-wide association studies for the detection of disease-associated genes or cancer drivers can only identify common variations or driver genes in a cohort of patients. Thus, they cannot discover unique disease-associated mutations or cancer driver genes on a personal basis. Moreover, even when there are such common variations, their significance is unknown. Here, we extend the machine learning based approach ENTPRISE developed for predicting the disease association of missense mutations to frameshift and nonsense mutations. The new approach, ENTPRISE-X, is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods VEST-indel and DDIG-in for predicting the disease association of germline frameshift mutations in terms of balanced measure Matthew’s correlation coefficient, MCC, with a MCC of 0.586 for ENTPRISE-X, versus 0.412 by VEST-indel and 0.321 by DDIG-in, respectively. Large scale testing on the ExAC dataset shows ENTPRISE-X has a much lower fraction of 16% of variations classified as disease causing, as compared to VEST-indel’s 26% and DDIG-in’s 65% of predictions as being disease-associated.

Genome-wide association studies for the detection of disease-associated genes or cancer drivers can only identify common variations or driver genes in a cohort of patients. Thus, they cannot discover unique disease-associated mutations or cancer driver genes on a personal basis. Moreover, even when there are such common variations, their significance is unknown. Here, we extend the machine learning based approach ENTPRISE developed for predicting the disease association of missense mutations to frameshift and nonsense mutations. The new approach, ENTPRISE-X, is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods VEST-indel and DDIG-in for predicting the disease association of germline frameshift mutations in terms of balanced measure Matthew’s correlation coefficient, MCC, with a MCC of 0.586 for ENTPRISE-X, versus 0.412 by VEST-indel and 0.321 by DDIG-in, respectively. Large scale testing on the ExAC dataset shows ENTPRISE-X has a much lower fraction of 16% of variations classified as disease causing, as compared to VEST-indel’s 26% and DDIG-in’s 65% of predictions as being disease-associated.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of acupuncture, sham acupuncture and drugs in the treatment of chronic constipation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of acupuncture and drugs for chronic constipation were comprehensively retrieved from electronic databases (such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP Database and CBM) up to December 2017. Additional references were obtained from review articles. With quality evaluations and data extraction, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using a random-effects model under a frequentist framework. A total of 40 studies (n = 11032) were included: 39 were high-quality studies and 1 was a low-quality study. NMA showed that (1) acupuncture improved the symptoms of chronic constipation more effectively than drugs; (2) the ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome was acupuncture, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, linaclotide, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, prucalopride, sham acupuncture, tegaserod, and placebo; (3) the ranking of side effects were as follows: lactulose, lubiprostone, bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol, prucalopride, linaclotide, placebo and tegaserod; and (4) the most commonly used acupuncture point for chronic constipation was ST25. Acupuncture is more effective than drugs in improving chronic constipation and has the least side effects. In the future, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to prove this. Sham acupuncture may have curative effects that are greater than the placebo effect. In the future, it is necessary to perform high-quality studies to support this finding. Polyethylene glycol also has acceptable curative effects with fewer side effects than other drugs.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196128</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b1:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lingping Zhu, Yunhui Ma, Xiaoyan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

Multicellular spheroids generated through cellular self-assembly provide cytoarchitectural complexities of native tissue including three-dimensionality, extensive cell-cell contacts, and appropriate cell-extracellular matrix interactions. They are increasingly suggested as building blocks for larger engineered tissues to achieve shapes, organization, heterogeneity, and other biomimetic complexities. Application of these tissue culture platforms is of particular importance in cardiac research as the myocardium is comprised of distinct but intermingled cell types. Here, we generated scaffold-free 3D cardiac microtissue spheroids comprised of cardiac myocytes (CMs) and/or cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and used them as building blocks to form larger microtissues with different spatial distributions of CMs and CFs. Characterization of fusing homotypic and heterotypic spheroid pairs revealed an important influence of CFs on fusion kinetics, but most strikingly showed rapid fusion kinetics between heterotypic pairs consisting of one CF and one CM spheroid, indicating that CMs and CFs self-sort &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into the intermixed morphology found in the healthy myocardium. We then examined electrophysiological integration of fused homotypic and heterotypic microtissues by mapping action potential propagation. Heterocellular elongated microtissues which recapitulate the disproportionate CF spatial distribution seen in the infarcted myocardium showed that action potentials propagate through CF volumes albeit with significant delay. Complementary computational modeling revealed an important role of CF sodium currents and the spatial distribution of the CM-CF boundary in action potential conduction through CF volumes. Taken together, this study provides useful insights for the development of complex, heterocellular engineered 3D tissue constructs and their engraftment via tissue fusion and has implications for arrhythmogenesis in cardiac disease and repair.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196714</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a6b:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tae Yun Kim, Celinda M.

There is a severe lack of aphasia screening tools for bedside use in Chinese. A number of aphasia assessment tools have recently been developed abroad, but some of these scales were not suitable for patients with acute stroke. The Language Screening Test (which includes two parallel versions [a/b]) in French has been proven to be an effective and time-saving aphasia screening scale for early-stage stroke patients. Therefore, we worked out a Chinese version of the LAST taking into consideration Chinese language and culture. Two preliminary parallel versions (a/b) were tested on 154 patients with stroke at acute phase and 107 patients with stroke at non-acute phase, with the Western Aphasia Battery serving as a gold standard. The equivalence between the two parallel versions and the reliability/validity of each version were assessed. The median time to complete one preliminary Chinese version (each had some item redundancy) was 98 seconds. Two final parallel versions were established after adjustment/elimination of the redundant items and were found to be equivalent (intra-class correlation coefficient: 0.991). Internal consistency is(Cronbach α for each version [a/b] was 0.956 and 0.965, respectively) good. Internal validity was fine: (a) no floor or ceiling effect/item redundancy; (b) construct validity revealed a 1-dimension structure, just like the French version. The higher educated subjects scored higher than their lower educated counterparts (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;). The external validity: at the optimum cut-off point where the score of version a/b &amp;lt;14 in higher educated group(&amp;lt;13 in lower): the specificity of each version was 0.878/0.902(1/1 in lower) and sensitivity was 0.972/0.944(0.944/0.944 in lower). Inter-rater equivalence (intra-class correlation coefficient) was 1. The Chinese version of the Language Screening Test was proved to be an efficient and time-saving bedside aphasia screening tool for stroke patients at acute phase and can be used by an average medical physician.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196646</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1632c3c60b0:1621674:3dd877af</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hongyan Yang, Shenghua Tian, Constance Flamand-Roze, Ling Gao, Wei Zhang, Yan Li, Jiajia Wang, Zhou Sun, Ying Su, Libin Zhao, Zhihou Liang&lt;/p&gt;

Interferon lambda (IFNλ) is a group of cytokines that belong to the IL-10 family. They exhibit antiviral activities against certain viruses during infection of the liver and mucosal tissues. Here we report that IFNλ restricts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; replication of the β-herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV). However, IFNλR1-deficient (&lt;i&gt;Ifnλr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were not preferentially susceptible to mCMV infection &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; during acute infection after systemic or mucosal challenge, or during virus persistence in the mucosa. Instead, our studies revealed that IFNλ influences NK cell responses during mCMV infection. &lt;i&gt;Ifnλr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited defective development of conventional interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-expressing NK cells in the spleen during mCMV infection whereas accumulation of granzyme B-expressing NK cells was unaltered. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, development of splenic IFNγ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; NK cells following stimulation with IL-12 or, to a lesser extent, IL-18 was abrogated by IFNλR1-deficiency. Thus, IFNλ regulates NK cell responses during mCMV infection and restricts virus replication &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; but is redundant in the control of acute and persistent mCMV replication within mucosal and non-mucosal tissues.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197596</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c2:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Gimeno Brias, Morgan Marsden, Jessica Forbester, Mathew Clement, Cordelia Brandt, Katherine Harcourt, Leanne Kane, Lucy Chapman, Simon Clare, Ian R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an important biomarker for patients with cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. It is also known that BNP levels are relatively higher in patients with chronic kidney disease and no heart disease; however, the mechanism remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;We developed a BNP reporter mouse and occasionally found that this promoter was activated specifically in the papillary tip of the kidneys, and its activation was not accompanied by &lt;i&gt;BNP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression. No evidence was found to support the existence of BNP isoforms or other nucleotide expression apart from BNP and tdTomato. The pBNP-tdTomato-positive cells were interstitial cells and were not proliferative. Unexpectedly, both the expression and secretion of BNP increased in primary cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes after their treatment with an extract of the renal papillary tip. Intraperitoneal injection of the extract of the papillary tips reduced blood pressure from 210 mmHg to 165 mmHg, the decrease being accompanied by an increase in serum BNP and urinary cGMP production in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHR-SP) rats. Furthermore the induction of BNP by the papillary extract from rats with heart failure due to myocardial infarction was increased in cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggested that the papillary tip express a substance that can stimulate BNP production and secretion from cardiomyocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197078</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4226a:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Itaru Goto, Ryuji Okamoto, Ryotaro Hashizume, Noboru Suzuki, Rie Ito, Keiichi Yamanaka, Hiromitsu Saito, Hiroshi Kiyonari, Isao Tawara, Yuki Kageyama, Yoshito Ogihara, Yusuf Ali, Norikazu Yamada, Naoyuki Katayama, Masaaki Ito&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract &lt;p&gt;HIV-positive individuals that have a detected transmitted drug resistance (TDR) at baseline have a higher risk of virological failure with antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study offers an update on the prevalence of TDR in Slovenia, looks for onward transmission of TDR, and reassesses the need for baseline drug resistance testing. Blinded questionnaires and partial &lt;i&gt;pol&lt;/i&gt; sequences were obtained from 54.5% (168/308) of all of the patients diagnosed with HIV-1 from 2011 to 2016. Subtype B was detected in 82.7% (139/168) of patients, followed by subtype A (8.3%), subtype C (2.4%), and CRF01_AE (1.8%). Surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) were found in four individuals (2.4%), all of them men who have sex with men (MSM) and infected with subtype B. K103N was detected in two patients and T68D and T215D in one person each, corresponding to a prevalence of 0%, 1.2%, and 1.2% of TDR to protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-NRTIs (NNRTIs), respectively. The impact of mutations on drug susceptibility was found to be most pronounced for NNRTIs. No forward spread of TDR within the country was observed; however, phylogenetic analysis revealed several new introductions of HIV into Slovenia in recent years, possibly due to increased risky behavior by MSM. This was indirectly confirmed by a substantial increase in syphilis cases and HIV-1 non-B subtypes during the study period. A drug-resistant HIV variant with good transmission fitness is thus more likely to be imported into Slovenia in the near future, and so TDR should be closely monitored.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196670</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefc3:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maja M.

Exosomes are endosome-derived membrane vesicles that contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The exosomal transcriptome mediates intercellular communication, and represents an understudied reservoir of novel biomarkers for human diseases. Next-generation sequencing enables complex quantitative characterization of exosomal RNAs from diverse sources. However, detailed protocols describing exosome purification for preparation of exosomal RNA-sequence (RNA-Seq) libraries are lacking. Here we compared methods for isolation of exosomes and extraction of exosomal RNA from human cell-free serum, as well as strategies for attaining equal representation of samples within pooled RNA-Seq libraries. We compared commercial precipitation with ultracentrifugation for exosome purification and confirmed the presence of exosomes &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; both transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Exosomal RNA extraction was compared using four different RNA purification methods. We determined the minimal starting volume of serum required for exosome preparation and showed that high quality exosomal RNA can be isolated from sera stored for over a decade. Finally, RNA-Seq libraries were successfully prepared with exosomal RNAs extracted from human cell-free serum, cataloguing both coding and non-coding exosomal transcripts. This method provides researchers with strategic options to prepare RNA-Seq libraries and compare RNA-Seq data quantitatively from minimal volumes of fresh and archival human cell-free serum for disease biomarker discovery.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196913</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475054:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emily N.

Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions (&amp;lt;180 kg/cow), the ‘hottest’ 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17% of the potential milk production of today’s average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197076</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475069:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nándor Fodor, Andreas Foskolos, Cairistiona F.

Despite the rapid worldwide expansion of parks with outdoor fitness equipment (OFE), no objective data regarding the intensity of activity associated with using OFE are available. Hence, this study quantified the energy expenditure and intensity of physical activity by examining four outdoor fitness devices widely used by older adults and provides objective evidence-based intensity references for the Compendium of Physical Activities. Sixteen older adults (mean age: 70.7 ± 5.6 yr) equipped with a portable metabolic system for measuring energy expenditure and activity intensity completed tasks while walking or using four types of OFE. Descriptive statistics and repeated-measures ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test were employed. The energy expenditure and activity intensity for using an air walker at tempos of 80, 100, and 120 bpm were 50.78 ± 14.76 (2.81 ± 0.85), 59.62 ± 14.23 (3.26 ± 0.82), and 65.62 ± 18.27 (3.55 ± 1.02) cal/kg/min (METs), respectively. The induced energy and intensity output values for a ski machine were 54.00 ± 14.31 (3.02 ± 0.87), 68.87 ± 22.74 (3.82 ± 1.35), and 74.55 ± 23.39 (4.05 ± 1.35) cal/kg/min (METs), at 80, 100, and 120 bpm, respectively. The energy output for a waist twister at 60 bpm was 38.43 ± 20.16 cal/kg/min (2.05 ± 1.15 METs), and that for a double arm stretch at 80 bpm was 31.05 ± 12.58 cal/kg/min (1.63 ± 0.70 METs). These findings indicate that activity on the ski machine and air walker could be considered to have moderate intensity, whereas the intensity of activity on the waist twister and double arm stretch was significantly lower than that for walking at either 3.2 km/h or 4 km/h and could be considered only light intensity. The MET values for the OFE were lower than those for similar indoor fitness equipment. The results of this study provide crucial implications for public health practices concerning the development of active living environments.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196507</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4d:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hsueh-wen Chow, Chia-Hua Ho&lt;/p&gt;

Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5)&lt;/i&gt; gene cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Recently we have generated &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice by targeting exon 2 on the C57BL/6N background, and demonstrated postsynaptic overaccumulation of GluN2B-containing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus. In the current study, we subjected the &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice to a battery of comprehensive behavioral tests, aiming to reveal the effects of loss of CDKL5 in a whole perspective of motor, emotional, social, and cognition/memory functions, and to identify its undetermined roles. The neurological screen, rotarod, hot plate, prepulse inhibition, light/dark transition, open field, elevated plus maze, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, one-chamber and three-chamber social interaction, 24-h home cage monitoring, contextual and cued fear conditioning, Barnes maze, and T-maze tests were applied on adult &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y and +/Y mice. &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a mild alteration in the gait. Analyses of emotional behaviors revealed significantly enhanced anxiety-like behaviors of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice. Depressive-like behaviors and social interaction of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were uniquely altered. The contextual and cued fear conditioning of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were comparable to control mice; however, &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a significantly increased freezing time and a significantly decreased distance traveled during the pretone period in the altered context. Both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory were significantly impaired. The morphometric analysis of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed impaired dendritic arborization and immature spine development in &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 plays significant roles in regulating emotional behaviors especially on anxiety- and fear-related responses, and in both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory, which suggests that focus and special attention should be paid to the specific mechanisms of these deficits in the CDKL5 deficiency disorder.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196587</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d752:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kosuke Okuda, Keizo Takao, Aya Watanabe, Tsuyoshi Miyakawa, Masashi Mizuguchi, Teruyuki Tanaka&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;It has been previously demonstrated that T lymphocytes may be involved in the development of hypertension and microvascular remodeling, and that circulating T effector lymphocytes may be increased in hypertension. In particular, Th1 and Th 17 lymphocytes may contribute to the progression of hypertension and microvascular damage while T-regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes seem to be protective in this regard. However, no data is available about patients with severe obesity, in which pronounced microvascular alterations were observed.&lt;/p&gt; Design and methods &lt;p&gt;We have investigated 32 severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, as well as 24 normotensive lean subjects and 12 hypertensive lean subjects undergoing an elective surgical intervention. A peripheral blood sample was obtained before surgery for assessment of CD4+ T lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocyte phenotype was evaluated by flow cytometry in order to assess T-effector and Treg lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A marked reduction of several Treg subpopulations was observed in obese patients compared with controls, together with an increased in CD4+ effector memory T-effector cells.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In severely obese patients, Treg lymphocytes are clearly reduced and CD4+ effector memory cells are increased.

Enhanced shrub growth and expansion are widespread responses to climate warming in many arctic and alpine ecosystems. Warmer temperatures and shrub expansion could cause major changes in plant community structure, affecting both species composition and diversity. To improve our understanding of the ongoing changes in plant communities in alpine tundra, we studied interrelations among climate, shrub growth, shrub cover and plant diversity, using an elevation gradient as a proxy for climate conditions. Specifically, we analyzed growth of bilberry (&lt;i&gt;Vaccinium myrtillus&lt;/i&gt; L.) and its associated plant communities along an elevation gradient of ca. 600 vertical meters in the eastern European Alps. We assessed the ramet age, ring width and shoot length of &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;myrtillus&lt;/i&gt;, and the shrub cover and plant diversity of the community. At higher elevation, ramets of &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;myrtillus&lt;/i&gt; were younger, with shorter shoots and narrower growth rings. Shoot length was positively related to shrub cover, but shrub cover did not show a direct relationship with elevation. A greater shrub cover had a negative effect on species richness, also affecting species composition (beta-diversity), but these variables were not influenced by elevation. Our findings suggest that changes in plant diversity are driven directly by shrub cover and only indirectly by climate, here represented by changes in elevation.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196653</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefc0:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Boscutti, Valentino Casolo, Paola Beraldo, Enrico Braidot, Marco Zancani, Christian Rixen&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings suggest that changes in plant diversity are driven directly by shrub cover and only indirectly by climate, here represented by changes in elevation.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/499?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/499.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/499?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Purcell, C.</name></author><published>1525369184000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Deconstructing time</title><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><fingerprint>c242929f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/499?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><keywords><item>Physics</item></keywords><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33ba0:3dd877af</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>7</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9</link><recrawled>1524513320971</recrawled><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Holly Else</name></author><published>1524466800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding</title><crawled>1524507756636</crawled><fingerprint>72e720de</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04958-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Young researchers who narrowly miss out on postdoctoral grant struggle to compete with those who just qualify.</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04958-9/d41586-018-04958-9_15713116.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162f3be485c:62505c7:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04958-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Young researchers who narrowly miss out on postdoctoral grant struggle to compete with those who just qualify.</content></content><engagement>60</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ester Nespoli</name></author><published>1524776400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Altered dopaminergic regulation of the dorsal striatum is able to induce tic-like movements in juvenile rats</title><updated>1524776400000</updated><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><fingerprint>20889c29</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ester Nespoli, Francesca Rizzo, Tobias Boeckers, Ulrike Schulze, Bastian Hengerer&lt;/p&gt;
Motor tics are sudden, repetitive, involuntary movements representing the hallmark behaviors of the neurodevelopmental disease Tourette’s syndrome (TS). The primary cause of TS remains unclear. The initial observation that dopaminergic antagonists alleviate tics led to the development of a dopaminergic theory of TS etiology which is supported by &lt;i&gt;post mortem&lt;/i&gt; and in vivo studies indicating that non-physiological activation of the striatum could generate tics. The striatum controls movement execution through the balanced activity of dopamine receptor D1 and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons of the direct and indirect pathway, respectively. Different neurotransmitters can activate or repress striatal activity and among them, dopamine plays a major role. In this study we introduced a chronic dopaminergic alteration in juvenile rats, in order to modify the delicate balance between direct and indirect pathway. This manipulation was done in the dorsal striatum, that had been associated with tic-like movements generation in animal models. The results were movements resembling tics, which were categorized and scored according to a newly developed rating scale and were reduced by clonidine and riluzole treatment. Finally, &lt;i&gt;post mortem&lt;/i&gt; analyses revealed altered RNA expression of dopaminergic receptors D1 and D2, suggesting an imbalanced dopaminergic regulation of medium spiny neuron activity as being causally related to the observed phenotype.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae77:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ester Nespoli, Francesca Rizzo, Tobias Boeckers, Ulrike Schulze, Bastian Hengerer&lt;/p&gt;

The mammalian secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily contains functionally diverse members, among which the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) display similar subunits. We searched for molecular similarities between Fel d 1 and ABP to examine the possibility that they play similar roles. We aimed to i) cluster the evolutionary relationships of the SCGB superfamily; ii) identify divergence patterns, structural overlap, and protein-protein docking between Fel d 1 and ABP dimers; and iii) explore the residual interaction between ABP dimers and steroid binding in chemical communication using computational approaches. We also report that the evolutionary tree of the SCGB superfamily comprises seven unique palm-like clusters, showing the evolutionary pattern and divergence time tree of Fel d 1 with 28 ABP paralogs. Three ABP subunits (A27, BG27, and BG26) share phylogenetic relationships with Fel d 1 chains. The Fel d 1 and ABP subunits show similarities in terms of sequence conservation, identical motifs and binding site clefts. Topologically equivalent positions were visualized through superimposition of ABP A27:BG27 (AB) and ABP A27:BG26 (AG) dimers on a heterodimeric Fel d 1 model. In docking, Fel d 1-ABP dimers exhibit the maximum surface binding ability of AG compared with that of AB dimers and the several polar interactions between ABP dimers with steroids. Hence, cat Fel d 1 is an ABP-like molecule in which monomeric chains 1 and 2 are the equivalent of the ABPA and ABPBG monomers, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85436:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rajesh Durairaj, Patrick Pageat, Cécile Bienboire-Frosini&lt;/p&gt;

Mitochondrial function affects many aspects of cellular physiology, and, most recently, its role in epigenetics has been reported. Mechanistically, how mitochondrial function alters DNA methylation patterns in the nucleus remains ill defined. Using a cell culture model of induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, in this study we show that progressive mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an early transcriptional and metabolic program centered on the metabolism of various amino acids, including those involved in the methionine cycle. We find that this program also increases DNA methylation, which occurs primarily in the genes that are differentially expressed. Maintenance of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH) oxidation in the context of mtDNA loss rescues methionine salvage and polyamine synthesis and prevents changes in DNA methylation and gene expression but does not affect serine/folate metabolism or transsulfuration. This work provides a novel mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and epigenetic regulation of gene expression that involves polyamine and methionine metabolism responding to changes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Given the implications of these findings, future studies across different physiological contexts and in vivo are warranted.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wIS7B5HAgw8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>37</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162d9ef60bd:bb3170:76251cdd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Oswaldo A.

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the non–cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636a1fc414:493cd5:abeb7260</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Françoise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

The Na/K-ATPase is an important membrane ion transporter and a signaling receptor that is essential for maintaining normal cell function. The current study examined the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulating miR-29b-3p, an anti-fibrotic microRNA, in a mouse chronic kidney disease (CKD) model (5/6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; partial nephrectomy or PNx). The results showed that CKD induced significant reduction of miR-29b-3p expression in the heart tissue by activation of Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. To demonstrate the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling, we also performed the PNx surgery on Na/K-ATPase α1 heterozygous (α1+/-) mice, which expresses ~40% less Na/K-ATPase α1 compared to their wild type littermates (WT) and exhibits deficiency in Na/K-ATPase signaling. We found that CKD did not significantly change the miR-29b-3p expression in heart tissue from the α1+/- animals. We also found that CKD failed to activate Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. Using isolated cardiac fibroblasts from α1+/- mice and their WT littermates, we showed that ouabain, a specific Na/K-ATPase ligand, induces decreased miR-29b-3p expression in fibroblasts isolated from WT mice, but had no effect in cells from α1+/- mice. Inhibition of NFκB by Bay11-7082 prevented ouabain-induced miR-29b-3p reduction in WT fibroblasts. To further confirm the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effect of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulation of miR-29b-3p and cardiac fibrosis in CKD animals, we used pNaKtide, a Src inhibiting peptide derived from the sequence of Na/K-ATPase, to block the activation of Na/K-ATPase signaling. The result showed that pNaKtide injection significantly increased miR-29b-3p expression and mitigated the CKD-induced cardiac fibrosis in these animals. These results clearly demonstrated that Na/K-ATPase signaling is an important mediator in CKD that regulates miR-29b-3p expression and cardiac fibrosis, which provides a novel target for regulation of miR-29b-3p in CKD. We also demonstrate that antagonizing Na/K-ATPase signaling by pNaKtide can reduce organ fibrosis through the stimulation of tissue miR-29b-3p expression.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197688</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7227:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher A.

Cathepsin B (CTSB), a lysososmal protease involved in cellular degradation process, is recently been studied as a potential candidate gene in the pathogenesis of TCP. According to cathepsin B hypothesis, mutated CTSB can lead to premature intracellular activation of trypsinogen, which is a key regulatory mechanism in pancreatitis. So far, CTSB mutations have been studied in pancreatitis and neurodegenerative disorders but little is known about the structural and functional effect of variants in CTSB. In this study, we investigated the effect of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with TCP, using molecular dynamics and simulation algorithms. There were two non-synonymous variants in the coding region (L26V and S53G) of CTSB, located in the propeptide region. We tried to predict the effect of these variants on structure and function using multiple algorithms: SIFT, Polyphen2, Panther, SDM sever, i-Mutant2.0 suite, mCSM algorithm and Vadar. Further, using databases like miRdbSNP, PolymiRTS and miRNASNP, two SNPs in 3-UTR region were predicted to affect the miRNA binding sites. Structural mutated models of nsSNP mutants (L26V and S53G) were prepared by MODELLER v9.15 and evaluated using TM-Align, Verify 3D, ProSA and Ramachandran plot. The results showed that the models (L26V and S53G) were of high accuracy. The 3D mutated structures were simulated using GROMACS 5.0 to predict the impact of these SNPs on protein stability. The results from in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these variants in the propeptide region of cathepsin B could lead to structural and functional changes in the protein. Hence, the structural and functional analysis results have given interim conclusions that these variants can have deleterious effect in TCP and thus should be screen in samples from all TCP patients to decipher its distribution in patient population.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308932v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16302ad305b:31c9b8:11c251fd</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Tropical Calcific Pancreatitis (TCP) is a neglected juvenile form of chronic non-alcoholic pancreatitis.

Mitigating extreme heat in urban areas is beneficial and sometimes critical to human health. Thriving plant communities in community parks play an important role in mitigating extreme heat through providing cooling effect, while inevitably affecting how people perceive the benefits of using community parks for recreation. Thus, the impacts of plant communities on the thermal environment should be quantified to determine the optimal structure of the plant community. The goal would be to harmonize the functions of improving the thermal environment with the preferences people have related to the recreational benefits of plant communities with various levels of vegetation density. In this paper, the correlations between the structural characteristics of plant communities and their function in mitigating the thermal environment were investigated on calm summer days in Xincheng Central Park, Minhang District, Shanghai, China. In addition to analyzing the plant communities present and their effects on the park microclimate, a questionnaire was employed to determine the plant community preferences of recreational park users. The results showed that plant communities could reduce the air temperature by 1.23–2.42 °C and increase the relative humidity by 2.4–4.2% during the daytime. The microclimate conditions in plant communities with varying vegetation densities were significantly different. The canopy density and leaf area index primarily controlled the temperature reduction, while the canopy density and total canopy cover ratio primarily controlled the increase in humidity; meanwhile, these correlations varied at different times of the day. Moreover, most of the park users preferred a moderately dense plant community which met their environmental perceptions for recreation in parks. Age or education level variables of park users would also predict preferences for different plant community densities. Ultimately, one plant community pattern with appropriate canopy density (60%), leaf area index (≥3) and canopy cover ratio (total 0.80–1.20, with 0.6–0.75 for trees and 0.20–0.45 for shrubs/woodland area) was recommended, which would harmonize the functions of the mitigation of the thermal environment with most people’s perception of a desirable vegetation density.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196445</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7707:9f3b30f2</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhigang Li, Dan Chen, Shize Cai, Shengquan Che&lt;/p&gt;

Ultimately, one plant community pattern with appropriate canopy density (60%), leaf area index (≥3) and canopy cover ratio (total 0.80–1.20, with 0.6–0.75 for trees and 0.20–0.45 for shrubs/woodland area) was recommended, which would harmonize the functions of the mitigation of the thermal environment with most people’s perception of a desirable vegetation density.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/588?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/588.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/588?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Garber, K.</name></author><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>A new cancer immunotherapy suffers a setback</title><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>e4bf12ad</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/588?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><keywords><item>Cell Biology, Medicine, Diseases</item></keywords><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7f2:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>73</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0518-385</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw685/nature-assets/nbt/journal/v36/n5/images/nbt0518-385-I1.jpg</url><height>361</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>600</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1525849200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Around the world in a month</title><crawled>1525709458882</crawled><fingerprint>8f771ac8</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0518-385</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Around the world in a month&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the world in a month, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0518-385&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt0518-385&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Around the world in a month</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0518-385</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_1633b5ecdc2:29a6358:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Biotechnology</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Around the world in a month&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the world in a month, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0518-385&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt0518-385&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Around the world in a month</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Christi Patten</name></author><published>1525986000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Survey of potential receptivity to robotic-assisted exercise coaching in a diverse sample of smokers and nonsmokers</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><fingerprint>46fbfa4e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christi Patten, James Levine, Ioannis Pavlidis, Joyce Balls-Berry, Arya Shah, Christine Hughes, Tabetha Brockman, Miguel Valdez Soto, Daniel Witt, Gabriel Koepp, Pamela Sinicrope, Jamie Richards&lt;/p&gt;
A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914c:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christi Patten, James Levine, Ioannis Pavlidis, Joyce Balls-Berry, Arya Shah, Christine Hughes, Tabetha Brockman, Miguel Valdez Soto, Daniel Witt, Gabriel Koepp, Pamela Sinicrope, Jamie Richards&lt;/p&gt;

Beckwitt, Keisuke Shiraha, Alan Wells&lt;/p&gt;
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have been used as lipid lowering drugs for decades and several epidemiological studies suggest statin usage correlates with a decreased incidence of cancer specific mortality in patients. However, the mechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that statin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determine their growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilic atorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Statin sensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of the membrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signaling pathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employed inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found that inhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breast cancer cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes. The same effect was not observed with inhibition of Mek signaling through Erk. Moreover, the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to atorvastatin-mediated growth suppression correlated with a decrease in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. As an increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis and metastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197422</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8b:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Colin H.

The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have been used as lipid lowering drugs for decades and several epidemiological studies suggest statin usage correlates with a decreased incidence of cancer specific mortality in patients. However, the mechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that statin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determine their growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilic atorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Statin sensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of the membrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signaling pathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employed inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found that inhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breast cancer cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of deer, elk, moose, and reindeer (cervids) caused by misfolded prion proteins. The disease has been reported across North America and recently discovered in northern Europe. Transmission of CWD in wild cervid populations can occur through environmental routes, but limited ability to detect prions in environmental samples has prevented the identification of potential transmission “hot spots”. We establish widespread CWD prion contamination of mineral licks used by free-ranging cervids in an enzootic area in Wisconsin, USA. We show mineral licks can serve as reservoirs of CWD prions and thus facilitate disease transmission. Furthermore, mineral licks attract livestock and other wildlife that also obtain mineral nutrients via soil and water consumption. Exposure to CWD prions at mineral licks provides potential for cross-species transmission to wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Managing deer use of mineral licks warrants further consideration to help control outbreaks of CWD.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196745</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a18b:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ian H.

p73 is a member of the p53 protein family and has essential functions in several signaling pathways involved in development, differentiation, DNA damage responses and cancer. As a transcription factor, p73 achieves these functions by binding to consensus DNA sequences and p73 shares at least partial target DNA binding sequence specificity with p53. Transcriptional activation by p73 has been demonstrated for more than fifty p53 targets in yeast and/or human cancer cell lines. It has also been shown previously that p53 binding to DNA is strongly dependent on DNA topology and the presence of inverted repeats that can form DNA cruciforms, but whether p73 transcriptional activity has similar dependence has not been investigated. Therefore, we evaluated p73 binding to a set of p53-response elements with identical theoretical binding affinity in their linear state, but different probabilities to form extra helical structures. We show by a yeast-based assay that transactivation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; correlated more with the relative propensity of a response element to form cruciforms than to its expected &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; DNA binding affinity. Structural features of p73 target sites are therefore likely to be an important determinant of its transactivation function.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195835</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb6:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jana Čechová, Jan Coufal, Eva B.

South Africa has a Universal Test and Treat (UTT) policy in place to ensure that everyone tests for HIV and can access treatment if they test positive. The aim of this study is to document the pathways that older South Africans who are living with HIV take to access testing and treatment in this context. Despite the aging of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and clear evidence that testing older persons (over age 50) is necessary, very little is known about the circumstances under which older persons test for HIV or their motivations for doing so. In this study, we analyze 21 qualitative, in-depth interviews with women and men aged 50 and over who are living with HIV from two townships outside of Cape Town. Using grounded theory to specify emerging themes, we find similarities and differences between older men and women in their pathways to testing. Men primarily test for HIV when their spouse is diagnosed or in connection with TB testing and treatment. Older women, who are more likely to be widowed or divorced, often test for HIV only when they are symptomatic or not responding appropriately to care for non-communicable diseases. Most importantly, we find that older South Africans do not seek testing as a response to risk. Instead, older men and women test only once they are symptomatic and referred by a provider, or as a result of a partner’s status. Our respondents, particularly the women, expressed “shock” and confusion at learning they were HIV-positive because they do not see themselves as at risk of acquiring HIV. Because the benefits of UTT are greatest with early detection and treatment, older persons’ tendency to test at such a late stage of illness decreases the individual and population level advantages of UTT. More research is needed to understand older persons’ risk and testing behavior so that policy and programs include HIV testing messages that reach this population.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196158</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb98:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Enid Schatz, Lucia Knight&lt;/p&gt;

Haploinsufficiency, a dominant phenotype caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation, has been rarely observed. However, high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping of yeast morphological characteristics revealed haploinsufficiency phenotypes for more than half of 1,112 essential genes under optimal growth conditions. Additionally, 40% of the essential genes with no obvious phenotype under optimal growth conditions displayed haploinsufficiency under severe growth conditions. Haploinsufficiency was detected more frequently in essential genes than in nonessential genes. Similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were observed mostly in mutants with heterozygous deletion of functionally related genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency phenotypes were caused by functional defects of the genes. A global view of the gene network was presented based on the similarities of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Our dataset contains rich information regarding essential gene functions, providing evidence that single-cell phenotyping is a powerful approach, even in the heterozygous condition, for analyzing complex biological systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/T_6m60ob9nc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><engagementRate>0.04</engagementRate><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636a0d7f35:4c6cd:d63e3ae2</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shinsuke Ohnuki, Yoshikazu Ohya&lt;/p&gt;

Vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), a food additive with rich milk flavor, is commonly used in the food, beverage and cosmetic industries. However, excessive consumption of vanillin may cause liver and kidney damage. Therefore, methods for detecting and controlling the level of vanillin in food, especially in infant powder, have important practical significance. In this study, we established a colorimetric assay for vanillin detection. The detection was performed under high-temperature and acidic conditions, which can induce the reaction of the aldehyde group of vanillin with the amino group of o-toluidine. The resulting product had a maximum absorption at 363 nm, which was quantified by a UV spectrophotometer. This assay had a limit of detection (&lt;i&gt;LOD&lt;/i&gt;) of 1 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and a linear range between 1 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 100 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The average recoveries at three spiked levels were in the range from 91.1% to 101.6% with a relative standard deviation (&lt;i&gt;RSD&lt;/i&gt;) of 4.62% ~ 7.27%.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194010</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7ed:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jin Zhao, Haixiong Xia, Tingyu Yu, Lu Jin, Xuehua Li, Yinghui Zhang, Liping Shu, Lingwen Zeng, Zhixu He&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;A major feature of acute lung injury (ALI) is excessive inflammation in the lung. Vitexin is an active component from medicinal plants which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the pathophysiological processes in ALI. In the current study, we investigate the effect and potential mechanisms of Vitexin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;ALI was induced by LPS intratracheal instillation in C57BL/6 wild-type mice and Nrf2 gene knocked down (Nrf2-/-) mice. One hour before LPS challenge, Vitexin or vehicle intraperitoneal injection was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues were examined for lung inflammation and injury at 24 h after LPS challenge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our animal study’s results showed that LPS-induced recruitment of neutrophils and elevation of proinflammatory cytokine levels were attenuated by Vitexin treatment. Vitexin decreased lung edema and alveolar protein content. Moreover, Vitexin activated nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and increased the activity of its target gene heme oxygenase (HO)-1. The LPS-induced reactive oxygen species were inhibited by Vitexin. In addition, the activation of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat PYD-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was suppressed by Vitexin. However, these effects of Vitexin were abolished in the Nrf2-/- mice. Our cell studies showed that Vitexin enhanced the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 activity. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-1β productions were reduced in Vitexin-treated cells. However, knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA in RAW cells reversed the benefit of Vitexin.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Vitexin suppresses LPS-induced ALI by controlling Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196405</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67c1:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ying Lu, Ting Yu, Jingyao Liu, Lina Gu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Although increased serum IgG4 level and tissue infiltration of IgG4-positive cells are key events in IgG4-related disease (IgG4RD), and nearly half of IgG4RD patients show hypocomplementemia, the role of IgG4 in the pathogenesis of IgG4RD remains unclear. Many reports show that altered IgG glycosylation, especially IgG with agalactosylated N-linked glycan (G0 N-glycan), have proinflammatory roles including complement activation, implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. This study determined the concentration of N-linked glycans (N-glycan) released from serum IgG4 in IgG4RD patients and compared the difference of glycosylation changes to those in healthy controls. We also compared the concentration of each IgG4 glycoform between patients with and without hypocomplementemia and individual organ involvement (kidney, pancreas, lymph node) in IgG4RD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We collected sera from 12 IgG4RD patients and 8 healthy controls. IgG4 was isolated from sera via Melon™ Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit followed by Capture Select IgG4 (Hu) Affinity Matrix. IgG4 N-glycans were analyzed by S-BIO Glycan&lt;i&gt;Map&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Xpress methodology.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Significant increases of IgG4 G0 N-glycan and IgG4 fucosylated N-glycan (F1 N-glycan) concentrations were observed in IgG4RD compared with healthy controls. Although we observed decreased levels of IgG4 F0 glycan in IgG4RD with hypocomplementemia, there were no significant differences in the galactosylation and sialyation of IgG4 N-glycans. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the glycosylation of IgG4 N-glycans between patients with and without individual organ involvement of IgG4RD.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although IgG4 has anti-inflammatory properties, IgG4 G0 and F1 glycans were increased in patients with IgG4RD. Our results suggest that decreased galactosylation of IgG4 is not related to complement activation and the differences of individual organ involvement in IgG4RD.

The vertebrate neuroepithelium is composed of elongated progenitors whose reciprocal attachments ensure the continuity of the ventricular wall. As progenitors commit to differentiation, they translocate their nucleus basally and eventually withdraw their apical endfoot from the ventricular surface. However, the mechanisms allowing this delamination process to take place while preserving the integrity of the neuroepithelial tissue are still unclear. Here, we show that Notch signaling, which is classically associated with an undifferentiated state, remains active in prospective neurons until they delaminate. During this transition period, prospective neurons rapidly reduce their apical surface and only later down-regulate N-Cadherin levels. Upon Notch blockade, nascent neurons disassemble their junctions but fail to reduce their apical surface. This disrupted sequence weakens the junctional network and eventually leads to breaches in the ventricular wall. We also provide evidence that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) promotes differentiation by reducing Notch signaling through a &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition mechanism. However, during the delamination process, the ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1) transiently blocks this &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition and sustains Notch activity to defer differentiation. We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>144</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16317b82452:13eb348:a96d255</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chooyoung Baek, Lucy Freem, Rosette Goïame, Helen Sang, Xavier Morin, Samuel Tozer&lt;/p&gt;

We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004162</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24792-3</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/bJ7j9dGNVo8/s41598-018-24792-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Henrietta Cserne Szappanos</name></author><published>1525330800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Author Correction: Identification of a novel cAMP dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation site on the human cardiac calcium channel</title><crawled>1525335500099</crawled><fingerprint>7f9e8871</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24792-3</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Identification of a novel cAMP dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation site on the human cardiac calcium channel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Identification of a novel cAMP dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation site on the human cardiac calcium channel, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24792-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24792-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Identification of a novel cAMP dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation site on the human cardiac calcium channel&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/bJ7j9dGNVo8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1632514a543:b2a088:5785ab88</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Identification of a novel cAMP dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation site on the human cardiac calcium channel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Identification of a novel cAMP dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation site on the human cardiac calcium channel, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24792-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24792-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Identification of a novel cAMP dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation site on the human cardiac calcium channel&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/bJ7j9dGNVo8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24792-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5008783?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5008783?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>P.

Copper-64 is an attractive radionuclide for PET imaging and is frequently used in clinical applications. The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; performance of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl-Phe-cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)-Lys-Thr-Cys)D-Tyr-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D-Phe-cyclo(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys)Thr). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist &lt;sup&gt;64/nat&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist &lt;sup&gt;64/nat&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to &gt;80% tumor blocking. &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; stability. PET studies of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 reflected the biodistribution data with nicely delineated tumor and low background. &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 shows promising pharmacokinetic properties for further translation into the clinic.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195802</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe31:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Svetlana N.

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm).

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods.

Background &lt;p&gt;Crime and violence causes massive disruptions to the health, survival and development of populations. In South Africa, incredibly high rates of crime and violence are noted. The country also has a very large youth population whose health, survival and development are key to economic growth. Among other efforts to encourage healthy youth development and the promotion of social activities such as sports, youth groups, choirs and so forth. This study examines the relationship between perceived community safety and the uptake of social activities among youth in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Data and methods &lt;p&gt;This paper uses data from the National Youth Lifestyle Survey (2008) with an unweighted sample of 4,391 youth (age12-22 years old). Using chi-square and logistic regression analysis the association between perceived community safety and social activity participation are tested.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that youth participation in social activities in South Africa is high (55% of males and 45% of females). Among males, the most prominent activity is sports (51.8%), while for females there is high participation in choir and singing groups (55.68%). More than 50% of males perceive their communities as risky while less than half of females feel the same. Male youth are more likely to participate in social activities if they perceive their communities as risky (OR = 1.04). Females (OR = 0.83), youth have a negative view of their future (OR = 0.43) are less likely to participate in social activities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There exists an association between youth’s perception of community safety and their participation in social activities.

However, dimensionality of imaging data, together with a great variability of nuclear shapes present challenges for 3D morphological analysis. Thus, there is a compelling need for robust 3D nuclear morphometric techniques to carry out population-wise analysis. We propose a new approach that combines modeling, analysis, and interpretation of morphometric characteristics of cell nuclei and nucleoli in 3D. We use robust surface reconstruction that allows accurate approximation of 3D object boundary. Then, we compute geometric morphological measures characterizing the form of cell nuclei and nucleoli. Using these features, we compare over 450 nuclei with about 1,000 nucleoli of epithelial and mesenchymal prostate cancer cells, as well as 1,000 nuclei with over 2,000 nucleoli from serum-starved and proliferating fibroblast cells. Classification of sets of 9 and 15 cells achieves accuracy of 95.4% and 98%, respectively, for prostate cancer cells, and 95% and 98% for fibroblast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine these methods for 3D nuclear shape modeling and morphometry into a highly parallel pipeline workflow for morphometric analysis of thousands of nuclei and nucleoli in 3D.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313411v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636a1605d4:43e1690:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Quantitative analysis of morphological changes in a cell nucleus is important for understanding of nuclear architecture and their relationship with pathological conditions such as cancer.

Prepartum supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) may influence lipolysis and hyperketonemia in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of prepartum CLA supplementation on lactation performance and serum fatty acids (FA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in early lactation dairy cows, and secondarily on reproductive performance. Multiparous cows were enrolled in the study at 18 days prior to expected calving date, and randomly assigned 100 g/day of Lutrell Pure (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; 75% FA), providing 10 g/day of each CLA isomer (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-10 &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-12 and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-9 &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-11 CLA) or equivalent amount of rumen inert fatty acids as control (78 g/day of Energy Booster 100; Milk Specialties Global, Eden Prairie, MN). Treatments were top dressed daily to individual cows from enrollment to calving and all cows were offered the same ration. Blood samples were collected on the first day of supplementation, 10 days prepartum, and 1, 7, 14, and 30 days postpartum. Hyperketonemia was defined as serum BHB ≥ 1.2 mM. Milk yield was recorded daily until 60 days postpartum and averaged weekly. Milk samples were obtained weekly for component analysis. Prepartum CLA supplementation tended to increase serum concentration of cis-9, trans-11 CLA and increased trans-10, cis-12 CLA prepartum. Cows supplemented with CLA had increased milk protein yield and tended to have increased milk fat yield and milk yield, which together resulted in greater energy content of milk. Cows supplemented with CLA had lower serum FA on day 1 and 7 postpartum and overall lower serum BHB postpartum, which resulted in decreased prevalence of hyperketonemia on day 14 postpartum. There were no differences in body condition score change, other health disorders, or reproductive outcomes by treatment. Together, these findings indicate that prepartum CLA supplementation may be a plausible strategy to positively influence postpartum performance.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197733</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85441:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Caputo Oliveira, Ryan S.

The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contents in the environment have been rising due to human activities. Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels have been shown to affect plant physiology and soil microbes, which may alter the degradation of organic pollutants. Here, we study the effect of eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on PAH accumulation in a paddy soil grown with rice. We collected soil and plant samples after rice harvest from a free-air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment (FACE) system, which had already run for more than 15 years. Our results show that eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased PAH concentrations in the soil, and we link this effect to a shift in soil microbial community structure and function. Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; changed the composition of soil microbial communities, especially by reducing the abundance of some microbial groups driving PAH degradation. Our study indicates that elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels may weaken the self-cleaning ability of soils related to organic pollutants. Such changes in the function of soil microbial communities may threaten the quality of crops, with unknown implications for food safety and human health in future climate scenarios.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196439</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb8:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fuxun Ai, Nico Eisenhauer, Yuwei Xie, Jianguo Zhu, Alexandre Jousset, Wenchao Du, Ying Yin, Xiaowei Zhang, Rong Ji, Hongyan Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Endometrial Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (endMSCs) are multipotent cells with immunomodulatory and pro-regenerative activity which is mainly mediated by a paracrine effect. The exosomes released by MSCs have become a promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. More specifically, extracellular vesicles derived from endMSCs (EV-endMSCs) have demonstrated a cardioprotective effect through the release of anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic factors. Here we hypothesize that EV-endMSCs may be used as a co-adjuvant to improve &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; fertilization outcomes and embryo quality. Firstly, endMSCs and EV-endMSCs were isolated and phenotypically characterized for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays. Then, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies were performed on murine embryos co-cultured with EV-endMSCs at different concentrations. Our results firstly demonstrated a significant increase on the total blastomere count of expanded murine blastocysts. Moreover, EV-endMSCs triggered the release of pro-angiogenic molecules from embryos demonstrating an EV-endMSCs concentration-dependent increase of VEGF and PDGF-AA. The release of VEGF and PDGF-AA by the embryos may indicate that the beneficial effect of EV-endMSCs could be mediating not only an increase in the blastocyst’s total cell number, but also may promote endometrial angiogenesis, vascularization, differentiation and tissue remodeling. In summary, these results could be relevant for assisted reproduction being the first report describing the beneficial effect of human EV-endMSCs on embryo development.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196080</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb94:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebeca Blázquez, Francisco Miguel Sánchez-Margallo, Verónica Álvarez, Elvira Matilla, Nuria Hernández, Federica Marinaro, María Gómez-Serrano, Inmaculada Jorge, Javier G.

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197046</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f71:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarajan Sambathkumar, Renate Akkerman, Sumitava Dastidar, Philip Roelandt, Manoj Kumar, Manmohan Bajaj, Ana Rita Mestre Rosa, Nicky Helsen, Veerle Vanslembrouck, Eric Kalo, Satish Khurana, Jos Laureys, Conny Gysemans, Marijke M.

We report a computational model for the assembly of HIV-1 Gag into immature viral particles at the plasma membrane. To reproduce experimental structural and kinetic properties of assembly, a process occurring on the order of minutes, a coarse-grained representation consisting of a single particle per Gag molecule is developed. The model uses information relating the functional interfaces implicated in Gag assembly, results from cryo electron-tomography, and biophysical measurements from fluorescence microscopy, such as the dynamics of Gag assembly at single virions. These experimental constraints eliminated many classes of potential interactions, and narrowed the model to a single interaction scheme with two non-equivalent interfaces acting to form Gags into a hexamer, and a third interface acting to link hexamers together. This model was able to form into a hexameric structure with correct lattice spacing and reproduced biologically relevant growth rates. We explored the effect of genomic RNA seeding punctum growth, finding that RNA may be a factor in locally concentrating Gags to initiate assembly. The simulation results infer that completion of assembly cannot be governed simply by Gag binding kinetics. However the addition of membrane curvature suggests that budding of the virion from the plasma membrane could factor into slowing incorporation of Gag at an assembly site resulting in virions of the same size and number of Gag molecules independent of Gag concentration or the time taken to complete assembly.

We report a computational model for the assembly of HIV-1 Gag into immature viral particles at the plasma membrane. To reproduce experimental structural and kinetic properties of assembly, a process occurring on the order of minutes, a coarse-grained representation consisting of a single particle per Gag molecule is developed. The model uses information relating the functional interfaces implicated in Gag assembly, results from cryo electron-tomography, and biophysical measurements from fluorescence microscopy, such as the dynamics of Gag assembly at single virions. These experimental constraints eliminated many classes of potential interactions, and narrowed the model to a single interaction scheme with two non-equivalent interfaces acting to form Gags into a hexamer, and a third interface acting to link hexamers together. This model was able to form into a hexameric structure with correct lattice spacing and reproduced biologically relevant growth rates. We explored the effect of genomic RNA seeding punctum growth, finding that RNA may be a factor in locally concentrating Gags to initiate assembly. The simulation results infer that completion of assembly cannot be governed simply by Gag binding kinetics. However the addition of membrane curvature suggests that budding of the virion from the plasma membrane could factor into slowing incorporation of Gag at an assembly site resulting in virions of the same size and number of Gag molecules independent of Gag concentration or the time taken to complete assembly. To corroborate the results of our simulation model, we developed an analytic model for Gag assembly finding good agreement with the simulation results.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/526/eaap9415?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/526/eaap9415.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Mohammad, I., Starskaia, I., Nagy, T., Guo, J., Yatkin, E., Väänänen, K., Watford, W.

Background &lt;p&gt;Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remains a major cause of admission and inpatient mortality worldwide in children aged less than 5 years. In this study, we explored SAM prevalence and outcomes in children admitted in 13 Kenyan hospitals participating in a Clinical Information Network (CIN). We also describe their immediate in-patient management.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data for children aged 1–59 months collected retrospectively from medical records after discharge. Mean, median and ranges were used to summarize pooled and age-specific prevalence and mortality associated with SAM. Documentation of key signs and symptoms (S/S) and performance of indicators of quality of care for selected aspects of the WHO management steps were assessed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between documented S/S and mortality among SAM patients aged 6–59 months. Loess curves were used to explore performance change over time for indicators of selected SAM management steps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;5306/54140 (9.8%) children aged 1–59 months admitted with medical conditions in CIN hospitals between December 2013 and November 2016 had SAM. SAM prevalence identified by clinicians and case fatality varied widely across hospitals with median proportion (range) of 10.1% (4.6–18.2%) and 14.8% (6.0–28.6%) respectively. Seventeen variables were associated with increased mortality. Performance change over time of management steps varied across hospitals and across selected indicators but suggests some effect of regular audit and feedback.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Identification of SAM patients, their mortality and adherence to in-patient management recommendations varied across hospitals. An important group of SAM patients are aged less than 6 months. Continued efforts are required to improve management of SAM in routine settings as part of efforts to reduce inpatient mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197607</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85435:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susan Gachau, Grace Irimu, Philip Ayieko, Samuel Akech, Ambrose Agweyu, Mike English, on behalf of the Clinical Information Network Author Group &lt;/p&gt;

Loess curves were used to explore performance change over time for indicators of selected SAM management steps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;5306/54140 (9.8%) children aged 1–59 months admitted with medical conditions in CIN hospitals between December 2013 and November 2016 had SAM. SAM prevalence identified by clinicians and case fatality varied widely across hospitals with median proportion (range) of 10.1% (4.6–18.2%) and 14.8% (6.0–28.6%) respectively. Seventeen variables were associated with increased mortality. Performance change over time of management steps varied across hospitals and across selected indicators but suggests some effect of regular audit and feedback.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Identification of SAM patients, their mortality and adherence to in-patient management recommendations varied across hospitals. An important group of SAM patients are aged less than 6 months. Continued efforts are required to improve management of SAM in routine settings as part of efforts to reduce inpatient mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00225</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/Qkf_ijUogeA/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00225</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Josh T.

The powerful HiSeq X sequencers with their patterned flowcell technology and fast turnaround times are instrumental for many large-scale genomic and epigenomic studies. However, assessment of DNA methylation by sodium bisulfite treatment results in sequencing libraries of low diversity, which may impact data quality and yield. In this report we assess the quality of WGBS data generated on the HiSeq X system in comparison with data generated on the HiSeq 2500 system and the newly released NovaSeq system. We report a systematic issue with low basecall quality scores assigned to guanines in the second read of WGBS when using certain Real Time Analysis (RTA) software versions on the HiSeq X sequencer, reminiscent of an issue that was previously reported with certain HiSeq 2500 software versions. However, with the HD.3.4.0 /RTA 2.7.7 software upgrade for the HiSeq X system, we observed an overall improved quality and yield of the WGBS data generated, which in turn empowers cost-effective and high quality DNA methylation studies.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195972</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccbe:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amanda Raine, Ulrika Liljedahl, Jessica Nordlund&lt;/p&gt;

Oxygen is required for the completion of almost all known metazoan lifecycles, but many metazoans harbour abilities to withstand varying degrees and periods of hypoxia. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most popular model organism is extensively used as a model for the study of hypoxia and anoxia biology and it has been found that this nematode is capable of tolerance to varying degrees of hypoxia. Considering the extremely high diversity of nematodes, the effects of low oxygen concentration and mechanisms of adaptation to oxygen depletion differ among species. In this study, we used a simple assay to examine anoxia tolerance in four nematode species, including three free-living and one plant parasitic nematode. We found that the plant parasitic nematode &lt;i&gt;Bursaphelenchus xylophilus&lt;/i&gt; can survive more than 14 days under anoxic conditions. Comparisons of behaviour during anoxia induction and the repertoire of oxygen sensation genes among the tested species suggested the existence of different oxygen sensation systems between &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;xylophilus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;, which quickly introduce suspended animation in response to oxygen depletion to survive long-term anoxia.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197122</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd4:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hiromi Kitazume, Mehmet Dayi, Ryusei Tanaka, Taisei Kikuchi&lt;/p&gt;

The emergence of bacteria and cancer cells showing resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) has fostered a search for new, more selective and more effective alternatives to CAMPs. With this goal in mind, we looked for cecropin homologs in the genome and transcriptome of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana. Not only did we find paralogs of the conventional cationic cecropins (Cfcec+), our screening also led to the identification of previously uncharacterized anionic cecropins (Cfcec-), featuring a poly-L-aspartic acid C-terminus. Comparative peptide analysis indicated that the C-terminal helix of Cfcec- is amphipathic, unlike that of Cfcec+, which is hydrophobic. Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulations pointed to the lower conformational flexibility of Cfcec- peptides, relative to that of Cfcec+. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolution of distinct Cfcec+ and Cfcec- peptides may have resulted from an ancient duplication event within the Lepidoptera. Our analyses also indicated that Cfcec- shares characteristics with entericidins, which are involved in bacterial programmed cell death, lunasin, a peptide of plant origins with antimitotic effects, and APC15, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex. Finally, we found that both anionic and cationic cecropins contain a BH3-like motif (G-[KQR]-[HKQNR]-[IV]-[KQR]) that could interact with Bcl-2, a protein involved in apoptosis; this observation is congruent with previous reports indicating that cecropins induce apoptosis. Altogether, our observations suggest that cecropins may provide templates for the development of new anticancer drugs.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/307702v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162fbc93e3c:1fb331:91749e5b</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Cecropins form a family of amphipathic -helical cationic peptides with broad-spectrum antibacterial properties and potent anticancer activity.

Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7213:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Beau Oldenburg, Marijtje Van Duijn, René Veenstra&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been mentioning this technique on the blog since its early days, and I freely admit that when it was starting out I had trouble believing that it worked (or even could work). The idea, in short, is that you  append a short bit of DNA to a small-molecule starting material, and then elaborate that into a combinatorial library of compounds while the DNA is still attached. The key part is that after each step, you use molecular biology techniques to add more DNA bases to the end, and these sequences are deliberately chosen to encode the synthetic history of the compound as it’s been branched out. You can have a huge number of these things, since you split out into hundreds or thousands of individual wells along the way, each one of which gets a discrete building block (and a corresponding discrete DNA oligo “bar code” ligated to it. That process is the first use of molecular biology, since the enzymes involved are very good at their jobs indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, once you’ve recombined, you’ve got a small volume of solution in which there might be (should be, in fact) many millions of compounds, each with its own DNA tag. At this point, you run a screen for binding, washing off everything to leave only the tight binders, and you use PCR and modern sequencing to figure out the DNA sequences of what’s left. And that’s the back-end use of molecular biology, because this combination of techniques allows you to identify extremely small amounts of material, as long as it has a DNA sequence attached to it. When you get the sequences, you go back to your master key and figure out which compounds those were. . .OK, scaffold 1. . .with an aminopyrrolidine at the first position. . . and the (R)-methyl side chain in the next step. . .and capped off with heterocycle number forty-eight. That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the time-consuming step kicks in: synthesizing these things “off-DNA”. You most certainly do not have fifty million individual vials sitting downstairs, each with a fifty-mg sample of each member of the DNA-encoded library. That would be 2500 kilos of stuff, and that’s neglecting the weight of the vials! You’d need a serious building to hold the “real” samples of one DNA-encoded library, and that’s exactly what you’re trying to avoid ever having to do. So you head back to the hood and make the non-DNA forms of these hits (as many as you think appropriate or feasible) and see how they bind in that form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the point where my mental picture really began to break down when I first heard about this. A small molecule with enough DNA attached to it to be a useful bar code, in my mind, looked like a canoe towing an aircraft carrier. I had trouble believing that these things would screen in a meaningful way, and trouble believing that you wouldn’t just get a hit set that was dominated by all sorts of DNA-driven interactions (since there’s so much more DNA in that vial than there is small-molecule chemical matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, those concerns are not idiotic, but they don’t keep the idea from working, either. (I try to keep this example in mind whenever I’m evaluating a new technology). As that new short review illustrates, DEL screening does indeed work, and by now it has delivered compound series that have advanced to the clinic. Once you’ve made a DEL, the screening technique for it doesn’t vary all that much (in most cases), and you can try variations without too much trouble. These screens burn up less protein than most other HTS efforts, and a single DEL, once produced, is generally good for re-use in a large number of screens. The tough part, as mentioned, is the workup of the results The sequencing has gotten easier and cheaper over the years, as has the sheer number-crunching of figuring out what compounds hit and what the relationships are between them. Resynthesis, though, is still pretty much the same delirious happiness it’s always been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How large should these things be? There have been some reports of ridiculously huge libraries (billions, up towards a trillion compounds), but as Satz notes, there’s very little information about these and no sign that they’re producing more or better hits. His own experience seems to be that collections with (theoretical) compound counts in the millions/tens of millions have much better signal-to-noise and that at least under current conditions, going higher may well be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has some thoughts about where DEL technology might be going. As always, one possibility is the availability of new chemistries that can be performed in the presence of the DNA bar codes. The diversity of the libraries has been more dependent on the variety of the building blocks than the reactions used to put them together. Another idea that would open things up more would be to have a way to have the DNA barcodes present but allow the compounds themselves to be cut free under the assay conditions (in order to run cellular and functional assays). There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscombsci.6b00192&quot;&gt;several schemes&lt;/a&gt; being worked on to realize this, and they’re deserving of another post in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>7</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4483.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4483</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/17/4483/F1.medium.gif</url><height>187</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><author><name>Ehsan Shokri-Kojori, Gene-Jack Wang, Corinde E.

We demonstrate the efficiency of BoaG to explore the RefSeq database of genome assemblies and annotations to identify interesting features of gene annotation as a proof of concept for much larger datasets.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.57</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/DqnIEfpYzCg/nrd.2018.57</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Sarah Crunkhorn</name></author><published>1524812400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Malaria: Clues to vaccine design</title><crawled>1524806533747</crawled><fingerprint>5e1628c</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.57</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Malaria: Clues to vaccine design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaria: Clues to vaccine design, Published online: 27 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.57&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Malaria: Clues to vaccine design&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/DqnIEfpYzCg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_163058d4273:784a84:11c251fd</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Malaria: Clues to vaccine design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaria: Clues to vaccine design, Published online: 27 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.57&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Malaria: Clues to vaccine design&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/DqnIEfpYzCg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.57</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006091</link><recrawled>1524246129185</recrawled><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/H1rMm4y09CQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Reuben M.

The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were able to accumulate in gene-rich open chromatin regions due to their reduced capacity to interrupt gene regulatory architecture. GO term enrichment showed that mouse loss hotspots were strongly enriched for terms related to developmental processes. However, these genes were also located in regions with a high density of conserved elements, suggesting that despite high levels of DNA loss, gene regulatory architecture remained conserved. This is consistent with a model in which DNA gain and loss results in turnover or “churning” in regulatory element dense regions of open chromatin, where interruption of regulatory elements is selected against.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1rMm4y09CQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>9</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162e4229578:4d4f95:76251cdd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Reuben M.

The preference-performance hypothesis states that ovipositing phytophagous insects will select host plants that are well-suited for their offspring and avoid host plants that do not support offspring performance (survival, development and fitness). The mountain pine beetle (&lt;i&gt;Dendroctonus ponderosae&lt;/i&gt;), a native insect herbivore in western North America, can successfully attack and reproduce in most species of &lt;i&gt;Pinus&lt;/i&gt; throughout its native range. However, mountain pine beetles avoid attacking Great Basin bristlecone pine (&lt;i&gt;Pinus longaeva&lt;/i&gt;), despite recent climate-driven increases in mountain pine beetle populations at the high elevations where Great Basin bristlecone pine grows. Low preference for a potential host plant species may not persist if the plant supports favorable insect offspring performance, and Great Basin bristlecone pine suitability for mountain pine beetle offspring performance is unclear. We infested cut bolts of Great Basin bristlecone pine and two susceptible host tree species, limber (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexilis&lt;/i&gt;) and lodgepole (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;contorta&lt;/i&gt;) pines with adult mountain pine beetles and compared offspring performance. To investigate the potential for variation in offspring performance among mountain pine beetles from different areas, we tested beetles from geographically-separated populations within and outside the current range of Great Basin bristlecone pine. Although mountain pine beetles constructed galleries and laid viable eggs in all three tree species, extremely few offspring emerged from Great Basin bristlecone pine, regardless of the beetle population. Our observed low offspring performance in Great Basin bristlecone pine corresponds with previously documented low mountain pine beetle attack preference. A low preference-low performance relationship suggests that Great Basin bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle is likely to be retained through climate-driven high-elevation mountain pine beetle outbreaks.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196732</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a6d:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Erika L.

The current research developed and validated a Korean-translated version of the Personal Relative Deprivation Scale (PRDS). The PRDS measures individual differences in people’s tendencies to feel resentful about what they have compared to what other people like them have. Across 2 studies, Exploratory Factor Analyses revealed that the two reverse-worded items from the original PRDS did not load onto the primary factor for the Korean-translated PRDS. A reduced 3-item Korean PRDS, however, showed good convergent validity. Replicating previous findings using Western samples, greater tendencies to make social comparisons of abilities (but not opinions) were associated with higher PRDS (Studies 1 and 2), and participants scoring higher on the 3-item Korean PRDS were more materialistic (Studies 1 and 2), reported worse physical health (Study 1), had lower self-esteem (Study 2) and experienced higher stress (Study 2).</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197279</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e7:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunji Kim, Eunbee Kim, Eunkook M.

Background &lt;p&gt;There is evidence that maternal genotypes in folate-related genes are associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) independent of offspring genotype. We evaluated the relationship between maternal genotypes in methionine synthase (&lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;) and DNA methylation status in ALL to better characterize the molecular mechanism underlying this association.&lt;/p&gt; Procedure &lt;p&gt;We obtained bone marrow samples from 51 patients with ALL at diagnosis and from 6 healthy donors. Mothers of patients provided a saliva sample and were genotyped at 11 tagSNPs in &lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;. DNA methylation was measured in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients and six healthy marrow donors. We used hierarchical clustering to identify patients with a hypermethylator phenotype based on 281 differentially methylated promoter CpGs. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of maternal genotype on the likelihood of DNA hypermethylation in ALL and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify networks enriched for differentially methylated genes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-two cases (43%) demonstrated promoter hypermethylation, which was more frequent among those with &lt;i&gt;ETV6-RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; fusion and initial white blood cell count &amp;lt; 50 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L. Maternal rs12759827 was associated with aberrant DNA methylation (odds ratio [OR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval 1.46–16.31); non-significantly elevated ORs were observed for all other SNPs. Aberrantly methylated promoter CpGs aligned to genes with known cancer-related functions.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Maternal folate metabolic genotype may be associated with DNA methylation patterns in ALL in their offspring. Therefore, the effect of maternal genotypes on ALL susceptibility may act through aberrant promoter methylation, which may contribute to the &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; origins of ALL.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197408</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8a:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jeremy M.

Development of strategies to access these reagents from O2 would immediately enable use of O2 as a terminal oxidant in a broad array of substrate oxidation reactions.

Development of strategies to access these reagents from O2 would immediately enable use of O2 as a terminal oxidant in a broad array of substrate oxidation reactions.

Interleukin 17 (IL-17)–producing γδ T cells (γδ17 T cells) have been recently found to promote tumor growth and metastasis formation. How such γδ17 T-cell responses may be regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we report that tumor-associated neutrophils can display an overt antitumor role by strongly suppressing γδ17 T cells. Tumor-associated neutrophils inhibited the proliferation of murine CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells via induction of oxidative stress, thereby preventing them from constituting the major source of pro-tumoral IL-17 in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that low expression of the antioxidant glutathione in CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells renders them particularly susceptible to neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistently, superoxide deficiency, or the administration of a glutathione precursor, rescued CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T-cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, human Vδ1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ T cells, which contain most γδ17 T cells found in cancer patients, also displayed low glutathione levels and were potently inhibited by ROS. This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f4:f3bf0074</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Mensurado, Margarida Rei, Telma Lança, Marianna Ioannou, Natacha Gonçalves-Sousa, Hiroshi Kubo, Marie Malissen, Venizelos Papayannopoulos, Karine Serre, Bruno Silva-Santos&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Almost all medical journals now require authors to publicly disclose conflicts of interests (COI). The same standard and scrutiny is rarely employed for the editors of the journals although COI may affect editorial decisions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine the prevalence and magnitude of financial relationships among editors of 60 influential US medical journals (10 each for internal medicine and five subspecialties: cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, dermatology and allergy &amp;amp; immunology). Open Payments database was reviewed to determine the percentage of physician editors receiving payments and the nature and amount of these payments.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;703 unique physician editors were included in our analysis. 320/703 (46%) received 8659 general payments totaling $8,120,562. The median number of payments per editor was 9 (IQR 3–26) and the median amount per payment was $91 (IQR $21–441). The median total payment received by each editor in one year was $4,364 (IQR $319–23,143). 152 (48%) editors received payments more than $5,000 in a year, a threshold considered significant by the National Institutes of Health. COI policies for editors were available for 34/60 (57%) journals but only 7/34 (21%) publicly reported the disclosures and only 2 (3.%) reported the dollar amount received.&lt;/p&gt; Interpretation &lt;p&gt;A significant number of editors of internal medicine and subspecialty medical journals have financial COI and very few are publicly disclosed.

MRL/MpJ mice have abundant ovarian mast cells (MCs) as compared with other strains at postnatal day 0 (P0); however, they sharply decrease after birth. These ovarian MCs, particularly beneath the ovarian surface epithelium (SE), which express mucosal MC (MMC) marker, might participate in early follicular development. This study investigated the changes in spatiotemporal distribution of MCs in the perinatal MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. At P0 to P7, the MCs were densely localized to the ovary, especially their caudomedial region around the ovary-fimbria connection. The neonatal ovarian MCs showed intermediate characteristics of MMC and connective tissue MC (CTMC), and the latter phenotype became evident with aging. However, the expression ratio of the MMC to CTMC marker increased from P0 to P4 in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovary. Similarly, the ratio of MCs facing SE to total MC number increased with aging, although the number of ovarian MCs decreased, indicating the relative increase in MMC phenotypes in the early neonatal ovary. Neither proliferating nor apoptotic MCs were found in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. The parenchymal cells surrounding MCs at ovary-fimbria connection showed similar molecular expression patterns (E-cadherin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Foxl2&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/Gata4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as that of the ovarian surface epithelial cells. At P2, around the ovary-fimbria connection, c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; immature oocytes formed clusters called nests, and some MCs localized adjacent to c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; oocytes within the nests. These results indicated that in postnatal MRL/MpJ mice, ovarian MCs changed their distribution by migrating toward the parenchymal cells composing ovary-fimbria connection, which possessed similar characteristics to the ovarian surface epithelium. Thus, we elucidated the spatiotemporal alterations of the ovarian MCs in MRL/MpJ mice, and suggested their importance during the early follicular development by migrating toward the ovary-fimbria connection. MRL/MpJ mice would be useful to elucidate the relationship between neonatal immunity and reproductive systems.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196364</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba8:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Teppei Nakamura, Masataka Chihara, Osamu Ichii, Saori Otsuka-Kanazawa, Ken-ichi Nagasaki, Yaser Hosny Ali Elewa, Osamu Tatsumi, Yasuhiro Kon&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) induces a systemic inflammatory state affecting iron homeostasis. Patients with TB often have additional comorbidities such as anemia which can result in poorer treat outcomes. We studied the contribution of anemia and the role of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin among TB patients and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed serum samples from 102 TB cases and 98 controls without TB, matched by age/sex, for hepcidin, iron, and inflammation parameters. Five controls developed TB within 12 months. We used linear regression to assess associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) was more frequent among cases than controls (59.8% vs. 26.1%), but iron-deficiency anemia more frequent in controls (10% vs. 1%). The median hepcidin level was higher in cases than controls (63.7 vs. 14.2 ng/mL), but coinfections with HIV, helminths, and respiratory pathogens did not show cumulative effects. Hepcidin was associated with more severe TB symptom scoring (coefficient 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5–1.2) and higher mycobacterial load (0.7, 95% CI 0.4–1.0). Hepcidin was higher in TB cases and controls who developed TB compared to controls without TB (p&amp;lt;0.001), even when restricting to HIV-negative study participants.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;ACD was the predominate etiology in TB patients suggesting limited benefit from iron supplementation. Increased hepcidin levels long before active disease, indicating altered iron metabolism, may be a marker for developing disease among TB-exposed individuals. Clinical management of anemia and nutrition interventions in TB patients need to be considered to improve the clinical course and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195985</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fd:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jerry Hella, Colin I.

Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks.

Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eh0FCzbR2R4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006172</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5041.short?rss=1</link><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5041.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5041</canonicalUrl><published>1526400367000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>In This Issue [This Week in PNAS]</title><crawled>1526404381783</crawled><fingerprint>8323804d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5041.short?rss=1</originId><description>Habitat degradation and coral reef fish behavior Degraded coral reef at Lizard Island.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the nationwide seasonal peaks, risk factors, and utilization of medical resources of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;A Taiwan nationwide birth cohort was extracted from the Birth Certificate Application Database during 2007–2009 and prospectively linked to the National Health Insurance database. We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29–35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants without BPD born at &amp;lt; 32 wGA had higher RSVH rate than those born at 33–35 wGA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Overall, 56.4% of RSVH occurred within 9 months of CA.

The proposed model, in principle, can be effectively tuned to explore proliferation dynamics in a cell-type specific way to gain crucial insights about novel therapeutic intervention to prevent unwanted cellular proliferation.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25585-4</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/99PqeoEiT_c/s41598-018-25585-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Chang-Kug Kim</name></author><published>1525849200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Re-exploration of U’s Triangle Brassica Species Based on Chloroplast Genomes and 45S nrDNA Sequences</title><crawled>1525857424276</crawled><fingerprint>168e2efd</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25585-4</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re-exploration of U’s Triangle &lt;i&gt;Brassica&lt;/i&gt;

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are one of the important factors in controlling gene expression and elucidation of their roles has been attracting great interest. We have developed an improved method for analyzing a large variety of mutant CRE sequences in a simple and high-throughput manner. In our approach, mutant CREs with unique barcode sequences were obtained by biased randomization in a single PCR amplification. The original T7 promoter sequence was randomized by biased randomization, and the target number of base substitutions was set to be within the range of 0 to 5. The DNA library and subsequent transcribed RNA library were sequenced by next generation sequencers (NGS) to quantify transcriptional activity of each mutant. We succeeded in producing a randomized T7 promoter library with high coverage rate at each target number of base substitutions. In a single NGS analysis, we quantified the transcriptional activity of 7847 T7 promoter variants. We confirmed that the bases from −9 to −7 play an important role in the transcriptional activity of the T7 promoter. This information coincides with the previous researches and demonstrated the validity of our methodology. Furthermore, using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transcription/translation system, we found that transcriptional activities of these T7 variants were well correlated with the resultant protein abundance. We demonstrate that our method enables simple and high-throughput analysis of the effects of various CRE mutations on transcriptional regulation.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196905</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4225c:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryo Komura, Wataru Aoki, Keisuke Motone, Atsushi Satomura, Mitsuyoshi Ueda&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b00931&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, you can do hydrogenation reactions in a stainless-steel ball mill, without any sort of noble-metal catalyst. The hydrogen is produced when you add some n-alkane or diethyl ether to the mix (these actually get converted to gaseous methane and hydrogen under the milling conditions). Some pretty severe reductions are realized, for example, taking biphenyl all the way down to 1-cyclohexylcyclohexane. Olefins go to alkanes under these conditions, of course, and ketones and alcohols tend to just get erased: it’s a bulldozer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although it’s surprising, this reaction isn’t quite as much voodoo as it might appear. Well, not more than any other hydrogenation, anyway. The ball mill is, of course, a sealed vessel, and the authors show that the lower-boiling additives seem to be more effective, presumably because they increase the internal pressure. And it’s not like there’s no catalyst present, because you have the stainless steel. If you use zirconium oxide balls instead of the steel alloy ones, for example, you get no hydrogenation at all. Adding bits of different metals back in showed that the chromium is what’s producing the hydrogen from the alkanes or ether, while the nickel is acting as the hydrogenation catalyst itself. The stainless-steel alloy itself (304 steel) was the most effective combination, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balls do get eroded a bit under the conditions, so what you’ve got is finely divided metals, under some heat from the mechanical energy of the milling, and under hydrogen pressure from the decomposition of the co-reactants. No wonder things get reduced! But it’s not a reaction that you would have predicted up front. And even if you’d stipulated that hydrogenation would start under these conditions, I don’t think you would have guessed how powerful it would be. The last time I hydrogenated down a whole aryl system (it’s been a while), I was running at something like 1600 psi (110 bar) at 120C with a rhodium catalyst, and the stuff came out looking – and smelling – like old lawnmower oil. This reaction probably doesn’t get above 60 degrees, by contrast. Admittedly, there’s no word in the paper about the appearance or aroma of the crude products, but I’m willing to bet that that part remains the same. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25441-5</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/im52VtiAQDM/s41598-018-25441-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jan Rouke Kuipers</name></author><published>1525762800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Abstract images and words can convey the same meaning</title><crawled>1525772328510</crawled><fingerprint>55037069</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25441-5</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract images and words can convey the same meaning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract images and words can convey the same meaning, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25441-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25441-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Abstract images and words can convey the same meaning&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/im52VtiAQDM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25441-5/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25441_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>671</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f1e1e3e:1467e9:3dd877af</id><engagement>2</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract images and words can convey the same meaning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract images and words can convey the same meaning, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25441-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25441-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Abstract images and words can convey the same meaning&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/im52VtiAQDM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25441-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00745</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/nAvRqrLOvVw/acs.jpcb.8b00745</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Erika L.

A growing literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, Days Gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced (T1Gd) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs). This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression. Further, it was shown to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. While promising, the original paper did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric leaving the robustness of this cutoff in question. We harness the Bayesian framework to consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: 1) image acquisition and 2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first utilize synthetic data to characterize what non-error variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then consider the original patient cohort to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival. Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pre-treatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. Finally, we demonstrated that for this cohort there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression and was over 80\% reliable.

Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds with variable phenolic structures, have been found to possess anti-cancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors like CDK6. To understand the binding behavior of flavonoids that inhibit the active CDK6, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on six inhibitors, chrysin (M01), fisetin (M03), galangin (M04), genistein (M05), quercetin (M06) and kaempferol (M07), complexed with CDK6/cyclin D. For all six flavonoids, the 3’-OH and 4’-OH of B-ring were found to be favorable for hydrogen bond formation, but the 3-OH on the C-ring and 5-OH on the A-ring were unfavorable, which were confirmed by the MD simulation results of the test molecule, 3’, 4’, 7-trihydroxyflavone (M15). The binding efficiencies of flavonoids against the CDK6/cyclin D complex were mainly through the electrostatic (especially the H-bond force) and vdW interactions with residues ILE19, VAL27, ALA41, GLU61, PHE98, GLN103, ASP163 and LEU152. The order of binding affinities of these flavonoids toward the CDK6/cyclin D was M03 &gt; M01 &gt; M07 &gt; M15 &gt; M06 &gt; M05 &gt; M04. It is anticipated that the binding features of flavonoid inhibitors studied in the present work may provide valuable insights for the development of CDK6 inhibitors.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196651</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a63:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jingxiao Zhang, Lilei Zhang, Yangcheng Xu, Shanshan Jiang, Yueyue Shao&lt;/p&gt;

The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the use of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions. One of the challenges of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotation is the uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network topology and structural similarity to improve &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotations.

Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in &lt;i&gt;PIK3CA&lt;/i&gt; genes. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475057:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zixing Wang, Kwok-Shing Ng, Tenghui Chen, Tae-Beom Kim, Fang Wang, Kenna Shaw, Kenneth L.

Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25612-4</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/0vrCRs2bYFQ/s41598-018-25612-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jia Guo</name></author><published>1525244400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Author Correction: MiRNA-29c regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic nephropathy by targeting tristetraprolin</title><crawled>1525212922062</crawled><fingerprint>e579f2a8</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25612-4</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: MiRNA-29c regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic nephropathy by targeting tristetraprolin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: MiRNA-29c regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic nephropathy by targeting tristetraprolin, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25612-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25612-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: MiRNA-29c regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic nephropathy by targeting tristetraprolin&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/0vrCRs2bYFQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25612-4/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25612_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>421</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1631dc640ce:2818b68:4e164c41</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: MiRNA-29c regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic nephropathy by targeting tristetraprolin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: MiRNA-29c regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic nephropathy by targeting tristetraprolin, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25612-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25612-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: MiRNA-29c regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic nephropathy by targeting tristetraprolin&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/0vrCRs2bYFQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25612-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00175</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jctcce/~3/yY6eEmvT2GM/acs.jctc.8b00175</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Asaminew H.

This study investigated &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; expression in the &lt;i&gt;pars tuberalis&lt;/i&gt; (PT) of the pituitary and medio-basal hypothalamus (MBH) of sheep, across seasons and reproductive states. It has recently been proposed that season impacts alternative splicing of &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in the PT, which shifts the balance between angiogenic VEGFAxxx and anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms (with xxx the number of amino acids of the mature VEGFA proteins) to modulate seasonal breeding. Here, we used various RT-PCR methodologies and analysis of RNAseq datasets to investigate seasonal variation in expression and splicing of the ovine &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; gene. Collectively, we identify 5 different transcripts for &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; within the ewe PT/MBH, which correspond to splicing events previously described in mouse and human. All identified transcripts encode angiogenic VEGFAxxx isoforms, with no evidence for alternative splicing within exon 8. These findings led us to investigate in detail how “&lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt;-like” PCR products could be generated by RT-PCR and misidentified as endogenous transcripts, in sheep and human HEK293 cells. In conclusion, our findings do not support the existence of anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms in the ovine PT/MBH and shed new light on the interpretation of prior studies, which claimed to identify &lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt; isoforms by RT-PCR.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197123</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559152:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Didier Lomet, Benoît Piégu, Shona H.

In conclusion, our findings do not support the existence of anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms in the ovine PT/MBH and shed new light on the interpretation of prior studies, which claimed to identify &lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt; isoforms by RT-PCR.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197228</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197228</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Tatsuya Igawa</name></author><published>1525986000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion during level walking in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><fingerprint>739ad8b6</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197228</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Igawa, Junji Katsuhira, Akira Hosaka, Kenta Uchikoshi, Shinichi Ishihara, Ko Matsudaira&lt;/p&gt;
Lumbar spinal stenosis causes cauda equina and nerve root compression, resulting in neurological symptoms. Although trunk flexion during level walking may alleviate these symptoms by enabling spinal canal decompression, some patients do not use this strategy. We aimed to identify the kinetic and kinematic variables that affect trunk flexion in patients during level walking. Gait was recorded in 111 patients using a three-dimensional motion capture system and six force plates. From the data recorded, walking velocity, bilateral step length, cycle time, maximum trunk flexion angle, forward pelvic tilt angle, pelvic rotation angle, maximum and minimum joint angles, and moment and power of the lower limb were calculated. Then a step-wise multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion. The maximum hip extension angle (β = 0.416), maximum hip flexion moment (β = -0.348), and step length (β = 0.257) were identified as variables significantly affecting the trunk flexion angle. The coefficient of determination adjusted for the degree of freedom was 0.294 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis choose one of two strategies to alleviate symptoms during walking. One strategy is gait with trunk flexion posture to increase step length and hip extension angle. The other strategy is gait with trunk upright posture to decrease step length and hip extension angle.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197228</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915a:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Igawa, Junji Katsuhira, Akira Hosaka, Kenta Uchikoshi, Shinichi Ishihara, Ko Matsudaira&lt;/p&gt;

Increases of the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain generally lead to increases of production of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products. MnSOD is the first line of defense against the stress induced by mitochondrial ROS. Our previous studies demonstrated that EAE progression increased Na,K-ATPase activity in the mouse kidney cortex. Since mitochondria are the major source of ATP, our present studies were sought to determine whether EAE progression increased mitochondrial activity. We found that severe EAE increased mitochondrial complex II and IV activities without significantly affecting complex I activity with corresponding increases of ROS in the isolated mitochondria and native kidney cortex. Severe EAE augmented both cytosolic and mitochondrial MnSOD protein levels and activities and decreased the specific activity of mitochondrial MnSOD when the total mitochondrial MnSOD activity was normalized to the protein level. Using HEK293 cells as a model free of interference from immune reactions, we found that activation of Na,K-ATPase by monensin for 24 hours increased complex II activity, mitochondrial ROS and MnSOD protein abundance, and decreased the specific activity of the mitochondrial MnSOD. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase by ouabain or catalase attenuated the effects of monensin on the mitochondrial complex II activity, ROS, MnSOD protein level and specific activity. Kockdown of MnSOD by RNAi reduced the mitochondrial ability to generate ATP. In conclusion, EAE increases mitochondrial activity possibly to meet the energy demand from increased Na,K-ATPase activity. EAE increases mitochondrial MnSOD protein abundance to compensate for the loss of the specific activity of the enzyme, thus minimizing the harmful effects of ROS.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196277</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa5:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Balamurugan Packialakshmi, Xiaoming Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

We analyze the model of social interactions with coevolution of the topology and states of the nodes. This model can be interpreted as a model of language change. We propose different rewiring mechanisms and perform numerical simulations for each. Obtained results are compared with the empirical data gathered from two online databases and anthropological study of Solomon Islands. We study the behavior of the number of languages for different system sizes and we find that only local rewiring, i.e. triadic closure, is capable of reproducing results for the empirical data in a qualitative manner. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196593</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d753:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomasz Raducha, Tomasz Gubiec&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&lt;/i&gt; is endemic to China and is a new fruit tree species with economic and environmental benefits, with potential developmental and utilization applications. We report the first complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;. Its genome is 158,084 bp in size, and the overall GC content is 36.8%. An inverted repeats (IR) of 52,672 bp in size is separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region of 86,374 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 19,038 bp. The chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; contains 131 genes including 90 protein-coding genes, 33 transfer RNA genes, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. The genome has a total 510 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Of these, 306, 149, and 55 were found in the LSC, IR, and SSC regions, respectively. In addition, a comparison of the boundaries of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions of ten other &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species exhibited an overall high degree of sequence similarity, with slight variations in the IR boundary region which included gene deletions, insertions, expansions, and contractions. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; lost the &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRA/SSC border and it has the largest &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRB/SSC border among these &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species, whereas the &lt;i&gt;rps19&lt;/i&gt; gene was inserted at the IRB/LSC junction. Furthermore, phylogenetic reconstruction using 61 conserved coding-protein genes clustered &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Prunus tomentosa&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; provides a rich source of genetic information for studies on &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; taxonomy, phylogeny, and evolution, as well as lays the foundation for further development and utilization of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196473</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7708:9f3b30f2</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaopeng Mu, Pengfei Wang, Junjie Du, Yu Gary Gao, Jiancheng Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Phylogeny of hard ticks (Ixodidae) remains unresolved. Mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) are increasingly used to resolve phylogenetic controversies, but remain unavailable for the entire large &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; genus. &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma asiaticum&lt;/i&gt; is a parasitic tick distributed throughout the Asia. As a result of great morphological variability, two subspecies have been recognised historically; until a morphological data-based synonymization was proposed. However, this hypothesis was never tested using molecular data. Therefore, objectives of this study were to: 1. sequence the first &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; mitogenome; 2. scrutinise the proposed synonymization using molecular data, i.e. complete mitogenomes of both subspecies: &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;asiaticum and kozlovi&lt;/i&gt;; 3. conduct phylogenomic and comparative analyses of all available Ixodidae mitogenomes. Results corroborate the proposed synonymization: the two mitogenomes are almost identical (99.6%). Genomic features of both mitogenomes are standard for Metastriata; which includes the presence of two control regions and all three &amp;quot;Tick-Box&amp;quot; motifs. Gene order and strand distribution are perfectly conserved for the entire Metastriata group. Suspecting compositional biases, we conducted phylogenetic analyses (29 almost complete mitogenomes) using homogeneous and heterogeneous (CAT) models of substitution. The results were congruent, apart from the deep-level topology of prostriate ticks (&lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;): the homogeneous model produced a monophyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;, but the CAT model produced a paraphyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt; (and thereby Prostriata), divided into Australasian and non-Australasian clades. This topology implies that all metastriate ticks have evolved from the ancestor of the non-Australian branch of prostriate ticks. Metastriata was divided into three clades: 1. Amblyomminae and Rhipicephalinae (&lt;i&gt;Rhipicephalus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dermacentor&lt;/i&gt;); 2. Haemaphysalinae and Bothriocrotoninae, plus &lt;i&gt;Amblyomma sphenodonti&lt;/i&gt;; 3. &lt;i&gt;Amblyomma elaphense&lt;/i&gt;, basal to all Metastriata. We conclude that mitogenomes have the potential to resolve the long-standing debate about the evolutionary history of ticks, but heterogeneous evolutionary models should be used to alleviate the effects of compositional heterogeneity on deep-level relationships.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197524</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7bf:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhi-Qiang Liu, Yan-Feng Liu, Nuer Kuermanali, Deng-Feng Wang, Shi-Jun Chen, Hui-Ling Guo, Li Zhao, Jun-Wei Wang, Tao Han, Yuan-Zhi Wang, Jie Wang, Chen-Feng Shen, Zhuang-Zhi Zhang, Chuang-Fu Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Two-pore domain K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt;) are responsible for background K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents and regulate the resting membrane potential and cellular excitability. Their activity is controlled by a large variety of physicochemical factors and intracellular signaling pathways. The majority of these effects converge on the intracellular C-terminus of the channels, resulting in the modification of the gating at the selectivity filter. Another gating mechanism, the activation gate at the helix bundle crossing is also well documented in other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel families, however, it remains uncertain whether this type of gating is functional in K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. The regulation of TWIK-related spinal cord K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (TRESK) is different from the other K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. Regulatory factors acting via the C-terminus are not known, instead channel activity is modified by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the unusually long intracellular loop between the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; transmembrane segments. These unique structural elements of the regulation lead us to examine channel gating at the bundle crossing region.

Infection experiments are critical for understanding wildlife disease dynamics. Although infection experiments are typically designed to reduce complexity, disease outcomes still result from complex interactions between host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Cryptic variation across factors can lead to decreased repeatability of infection experiments within and between research groups and hinder research progress. Furthermore, studies with unexpected results are often relegated to the “file drawer” and potential insights gained from these experimental outcomes are lost. Here, we report unexpected results from an infection experiment studying the response of two differentially-susceptible but related frogs (American Bullfrog &lt;i&gt;Rana catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; and the Mountain yellow-legged frog &lt;i&gt;Rana muscosa&lt;/i&gt;) to the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus (&lt;i&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/i&gt;, Bd). Despite well-documented differences in susceptibility between species, we found no evidence for antibody-mediated immune response and no Bd-related mortality in either species. Additionally, during the study, the sham-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; control group became unexpectedly Bd-positive. We used a custom genotyping assay to demonstrate that the aberrantly-infected &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; carried a Bd genotype distinct from the inoculation genotype. Thus &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; individuals were acquired with low-intensity infections that could not be detected with qPCR. In the Bd-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; treatment group, the inoculated genotype appeared to out-compete the cryptic infection. Thus, our results provide insight into Bd coinfection dynamics, a phenomenon that is increasingly relevant as different pathogen strains are moved around the globe. Our experiment highlights how unexpected experimental outcomes can serve as both cautionary tales and opportunities to explore unanswered research questions. We use our results as a case study to highlight common sources of anomalous results for infection experiments. We argue that understanding these factors will aid researchers in the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments to understand wildlife disease processes.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196851</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed3:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Allison Q.

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636a1a35e2:4db35:d63e3ae2</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C.

Fish, birds, insects and robots frequently swim or fly in groups. During their three dimensional collective motion, these agents do not stop, they avoid collisions by strong short-range repulsion, and achieve group cohesion by weak long-range attraction. In a minimal model that is isotropic, and continuous in both space and time, we demonstrate that (i) adjusting speed to a preferred value, combined with (ii) radial repulsion and an (iii) effective long-range attraction are sufficient for the stable ordering of autonomously moving agents in space. Our results imply that beyond these three rules ordering in space requires no further rules, for example, explicit velocity alignment, anisotropy of the interactions or the frequent reversal of the direction of motion, friction, elastic interactions, sticky surfaces, a viscous medium, or vertical separation that prefers interactions within horizontal layers. Noise and delays are inherent to the communication and decisions of all moving agents. Thus, next we investigate their effects on ordering in the model. First, we find that the amount of noise necessary for preventing the ordering of agents is not sufficient for destroying order. In other words, for realistic noise amplitudes the transition between order and disorder is rapid. Second, we demonstrate that ordering is more sensitive to displacements caused by delayed interactions than to uncorrelated noise (random errors). Third, we find that with changing interaction delays the ordered state disappears at roughly the same rate, whereas it emerges with different rates. In summary, we find that the model discussed here is simple enough to allow a fair understanding of the modeled phenomena, yet sufficiently detailed for the description and management of large flocks with noisy and delayed interactions.

Treatment of prosthetic joint infections often involves multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic administration, resulting in a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system. We are exploring a non-invasive method to eradicate biofilm on metal implants utilizing high-frequency alternating magnetic fields (AMF) which can achieve surface induction heating. Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197380</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559162:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bingbing Cheng, Yonatan Chatzinoff, Debby Szczepanski, Chenchen Bing, Sumbul Shaikh, Omar Wyman, Cameron E.

The Tasmanian devil (&lt;i&gt;Sarcophilus harrisii)&lt;/i&gt;, the largest extant carnivorous marsupial and endemic to Tasmania, is at the verge of extinction due to the emergence of a transmissible cancer known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). DFTD has spread over the distribution range of the species and has been responsible for a severe decline in the global devil population. To protect the Tasmanian devil from extinction in the wild, our group has focused on the development of a prophylactic vaccine. Although this work has shown that vaccine preparations using whole DFTD tumour cells supplemented with adjuvants can induce anti-DFTD immune responses, alternative strategies that induce stronger and more specific immune responses are required. In humans, heat shock proteins (HSPs) derived from tumour cells have been used instead of whole-tumour cell preparations as a source of antigens for cancer immunotherapy. As HSPs have not been studied in the Tasmanian devil, this study presents the first characterisation of HSPs in this marsupial and evaluates the suitability of these proteins as antigenic components for the enhancement of a DFTD vaccine. We show that tissues and cancer cells from the Tasmanian devil express constitutive and inducible HSP. Additionally, this study suggests that HSP derived from DFTD cancer cells are immunogenic supporting the future development of a HSP-based vaccine against DFTD.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d74b:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cesar Tovar, Amanda L.

Calcium is an important second messenger in plants that is released into the cytosol early after recognition of various environmental stimuli. Decoding of such calcium signals by calcium sensors is the key for the plant to react appropriately to each stimulus. Several members of Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) act as calcium sensors and some are known to mediate both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; CML9 in different stress responses. CML9 was reported earlier as defense regulator against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast to salicylic acid-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;syringae&lt;/i&gt;, defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic fungi are mediated by jasmonates. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; is induced upon wounding and feeding of the insect herbivore &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera littoralis&lt;/i&gt;. However, neither different &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutant lines nor overexpression lines were impaired upon insect feeding. No difference in herbivore-induced phytohormone elevation was detected in &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; lines. The defense against the spider mite &lt;i&gt;Tetranychus urticae&lt;/i&gt; was also unaffected. In addition, &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; mutant lines showed a wild type-like reaction to the necrotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;Alternaria brassicicola&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our data suggest that CML9 might be a regulator involved only in the defense against biotrophic pathogens, independent of jasmonates. In addition, our data challenge the involvement of CML9 in plant drought stress response. Taken together, we suggest that CML9 is a specialized rather than a general regulator of stress responses in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197633</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c8:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Monika Heyer, Sandra S.

Calcium is an important second messenger in plants that is released into the cytosol early after recognition of various environmental stimuli. Decoding of such calcium signals by calcium sensors is the key for the plant to react appropriately to each stimulus. Several members of Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) act as calcium sensors and some are known to mediate both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; CML9 in different stress responses. CML9 was reported earlier as defense regulator against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast to salicylic acid-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;syringae&lt;/i&gt;, defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic fungi are mediated by jasmonates.

Not because it’s useful – that’s already known – but because it can explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b00270&quot;&gt;Here’s the paper&lt;/a&gt; (from UC-Irvine and Amgen), and the compound is the 4-azido derivative of phenylalanine. Interestingly, the authors were not trying to investigate its hazards, but were after an easier, safer, and cheaper synthetic route. They succeeded, by the way, along with providing some valuable reference work about how to determine its chiral purity and also (re)establishing a poorly characterized coupling reagent (Boc-Oxyma) as a useful species. Now, some people will look at this target compound and say “Well, yeah, sure, azide”, but organoazides are not all explosive. The lower the molecular weight, the more likely you are to run into trouble, but there are smaller azides than this one that still aren’t a problem to handle. I’ll say right off that I don’t know of any incidents with azido-Phe, which is a good thing, but the data in this paper suggest that such an incident is certainly possible. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns about the synthetic routes to this compound, I should note, is the presence of an azide ion / copper combination. It is a very solid general rule to avoid the formation of any transition-metal or heavy-metal azide species; they should all be considered explosion hazards (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/08/28/mercury_azides_ill_get_right_on_those_for_you&quot;&gt;“Things I Won’t Work With” reference&lt;/a&gt;, for emphasis). Want some more backing for that statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The sensitivity of dry cupric azide to friction is so great that it is prone to explosion &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/257189.pdf&quot;&gt;during its removal&lt;/a&gt; from filter paper. Copper(I) azide (cuprous azide) is similarly perilous, and explosions have been reported for this complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.19110244402&quot;&gt;while completely submerged&lt;/a&gt; in water and after being lightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/257189.pdf&quot;&gt;touched with a feather&lt;/a&gt; in open air. An intelligence bulletin from The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health warned in 1976 that several explosions had occurred in the United States and Canada, apparently resulting from the accumulation of heavy-metal azides in hospital plumbing. These events were likely due to the routine disposal of NaN3-laced waste from automatic blood cell counting machines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/78-127/78127_13.html&quot;&gt;directly into hospital drains&lt;/a&gt;. Since many of these incidents occurred while attempting to clear a blocked pipe, it seems unlikely that any metal azides present were dry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said the manuscript, dryly. So no, I don’t think we’ll be wanting any copper azide species if that can be helped (the covalent azides used in the copper-catalyzed “click” reaction are a different thing altogether). Since this new synthesis does still involve a copper-catalyzed azide formation, the authors carefully investigated the material in each step for explosion hazards. The good news is that none of the intermediates (nor the precipitates formed) seem to be hazardous. The bad news is that the final product is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was determined through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a technique where a (small!) sample is heated to increasing temperatures and monitored for excess heat being given off (exothermic decomposition), and its partner technique, accelerating-rate calorimetry (ARC). What these show is that the N-Boc derivative of azido-Phe is possibly a cause for concern, but the unprotected species is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; a problem. Its calorimetric behavior is similar to that of a high explosive, and it appears as if it could be shock-sensitive as well. I would say that this problem is unappreciated in the chemical literature, and it’s a good thing that no one discovered this the hard way. Perhaps a salt of the compound has better behavior and would be a safer reagent and article of commerce?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA. HMR programs provide weekly group coaching to achieve reduced calorie intake, increased fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity ≥2,000 kcal/wk. A Markov model predicted avoidance of diabetes and cardiovascular events and projected cost savings due to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 500 patients included in the analysis, 67% were female and mean age was 54.1 years (s.d. 11.6). The baseline weight and BMI were 243.5 lbs (range 144.0–545.0) and 38.8 kg/m2 (range 25.4–85.0), respectively. Overall, patients lost an average of 47.4 lbs (18.9% of initial body weight [IBW]); the amount of weight loss was consistent among those with diabetes/pre-diabetes (50%), high/moderate risk for dyslipidemia (60%), hypertension/pre-hypertension (86%), and severe obesity (37%). The mean IBW lost was 16.4%, 19.3%, 20.7% for ≤6 months (n = 165), 7–12 months (n = 140), 13–24 months (n = 195) of program participation, respectively. The simulation model estimated 22 diabetes and 30 cardiovascular events and $1,992,370 medical costs avoided over 5 years in the 500 patients evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Patients in the HMR clinic-based HILI program achieved substantial weight loss regardless of duration of program participation, risk profile and comorbid status.

Coupled binuclear copper (CBC) enzymes have a conserved type 3 copper site that binds molecular oxygen to oxidize various mono- and diphenolic compounds. In this study, we found a new crystal form of catechol oxidase from &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus oryzae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ao&lt;/i&gt;CO4) and solved two new structures from two different crystals at 1.8-Å and at 2.5-Å resolutions. These structures showed different copper site forms (&lt;i&gt;met/deoxy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;deoxy&lt;/i&gt;) and also differed from the copper site observed in the previously solved structure of &lt;i&gt;Ao&lt;/i&gt;CO4. We also analysed the electron density maps of all of the 56 CBC enzyme structures available in the protein data bank (PDB) and found that many of the published structures have vague copper sites. Some of the copper sites were then re-refined to find a better fit to the observed electron density. General problems in the refinement of metalloproteins and metal centres are discussed.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196691</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a6a:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Leena Penttinen, Chiara Rutanen, Markku Saloheimo, Kristiina Kruus, Juha Rouvinen, Nina Hakulinen&lt;/p&gt;

General problems in the refinement of metalloproteins and metal centres are discussed.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Clare Meernik</name></author><published>1524171600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>The effect of cigarillo packaging elements on young adult perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal</title><updated>1524171600000</updated><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><fingerprint>fab54a29</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Clare Meernik, Leah M.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Product packaging has long been used by the tobacco industry to target consumers and manipulate product perceptions. This study examines the extent to which cigarillo packaging influences perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A web-based experiment was conducted among young adults. Participants viewed three randomly selected cigarillo packs, varying on pack flavor descriptor, color, type, branding, and warning—totaling 180 pack images. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effect of pack elements on product perceptions.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2,664 current, ever, and never little cigar and cigarillo users participated. Cigarillo packs with a flavor descriptor were perceived as having a more favorable taste (β = 0.21, p &amp;lt; .001) and smell (β = 0.14, p &amp;lt; .001) compared to packs with no flavor descriptor. Compared to packs with no color, pink and purple packs were more likely to be perceived as containing a flavor (β = 0.11, p &amp;lt; .001), and were rated more favorably on taste (β = 0.17, p &amp;lt; .001), smell (β = 0.15, p &amp;lt; .001), and appeal (β = 0.16, p &amp;lt; .001). While warnings on packs decreased favorable perceptions of product taste (pictorial: β = -0.07, p = .03) and smell (text-only: β = -0.08, p = .01; pictorial: β = -0.09, p = .007), warnings did not moderate the effects of flavor descriptor or color.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that cigarillo packaging alters consumers’ cognitive responses, and warnings on packs do not suffice to overcome the effects of product packaging. The findings support efforts at federal, state, and local levels to prohibit flavor descriptors and their associated product flavoring in non-cigarette products such as cigarillos, along with new data that supports restrictions on flavor cues and colors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7902:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Clare Meernik, Leah M.

Particle separation in microfluidic devices is a common problematic for sample preparation in biology. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is efficiently implemented as a size-based fractionation technique to separate two populations of particles around a specific size. However, real biological samples contain components of many different sizes and a single DLD separation step is not sufficient to purify these complex samples. When connecting several DLD modules in series, pressure balancing at the DLD outlets of each step becomes critical to ensure an optimal separation efficiency. A generic microfluidic platform is presented in this paper to optimize pressure balancing, when DLD separation is connected either to another DLD module or to a different microfluidic function. This is made possible by generating droplets at T-junctions connected to the DLD outlets. Droplets act as pressure controllers, which perform at the same time the encapsulation of DLD sorted particles and the balance of output pressures. The optimized pressures to apply on DLD modules and on T-junctions are determined by a general model that ensures the equilibrium of the entire platform. The proposed separation platform is completely modular and reconfigurable since the same predictive model applies to any cascaded DLD modules of the droplet-based cartridge.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197629</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c6:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eloise Pariset, Catherine Pudda, François Boizot, Nicolas Verplanck, Frédéric Revol-Cavalier, Jean Berthier, Aurélie Thuaire, Vincent Agache&lt;/p&gt;

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods. As exemplified by the targeted gene identification of a master regulator WRI1, which regulates fatty acid biosynthesis, we found that the improved ChIP method worked well. We analyzed percentage input and fold changes of the ChIPed DNA. We also made successful ChIP-seq libraries using this method. This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506d:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;

This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195609</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195609</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Liping Huang</name></author><published>1524258000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Combined intervention of swimming plus metformin ameliorates the insulin resistance and impaired lipid metabolism in murine gestational diabetes mellitus</title><updated>1524258000000</updated><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><fingerprint>bcdbc13d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195609</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liping Huang, Pingping Yue, Xuefei Wu, Ting Yu, Yang Wang, Ji Zhou, Derun Kong, Keyang Chen&lt;/p&gt;
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has short- and long- term influence on pregnant women and fetus. Swimming, as an aerobic exercise, can effectively improve the blood glucose level in GDM, but the effect of mild swimming alone was not very substantial. Metformin, as an oral antidiabetic drug, has obvious hypoglycemic effect, and is economic also, but the long-term effect on pregnant women and fetus has not been completely clear. We hypothesize that combined intervention of mild swimming and low dose of metformin, may effectively reduce blood glucose, improve the pregnancy outcomes in GDM dams, but simultaneously avoiding the adverse effects caused by overdose of drug and impotence of mild swimming. The streptozotocin was used to stimulate C57BL/6J mice to develop GDM, by which serum glucose, TC, TG, LDL-C were increased significantly, meanwhile HDL-C was decreased significantly in the GDM control (DC) group compared with the normal control group. Swimming or metformin intervention slightly or moderately improves hyperglycemia, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice, while combined therapy of swimming plus metformin markedly ameliorated hyperglycemia (FPG, decreased by 22.2–59.5% from G10 to G18 versus DC group), insulin sensitivity (2.1 and 2.8 fold increase, respectively, in AKT activity versus DC group) and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; lipogenesis (3.2 and 7.0 fold decrease, respectively, in ACC activity, and 1.94 and 5.1 fold decrease, respectively, in SREBP2 level, versus DC group) both in liver and skeletal muscle from GDM mice. We conclude that the combined intervention by metformin plus swimming may be more effective than single action to ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; improving insulin sensitivity in GDM mice.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195609</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f7:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Liping Huang, Pingping Yue, Xuefei Wu, Ting Yu, Yang Wang, Ji Zhou, Derun Kong, Keyang Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Schmallenberg virus (SBV), initially identified in Germany in 2011, spread rapidly throughout Europe causing significant economic losses in ruminant livestock. The ability to correctly detect emerging and re-emerging diseases such as SBV with reliable tests is of high importance. Firstly, we tested diagnostic performance, specificity, and sensitivity of three different assays used in SBV antibody detection using control sheep samples of determined status. After obtaining the results from the control samples, we assessed the potential of the assays to detect previously infected animals in field situations. The samples were investigated using IDEXX Schmallenberg virus Antibody Test Kit, ID Screen Schmallenberg virus Competition Multi-species ELISA and Serum Neutralisation Test (SNT). Analysis of control samples revealed that SNT was the most suitable test, which was therefore used to calculate concordance and test performance for the two other ELISA tests. To evaluate whether different assay performances had an impact under field conditions, sheep samples from two different contexts were tested: the emergence of SBV in Ireland and the re-emergence of SBV in Belgium. Comparing the results obtained from different assays to the non-reference standard assay SNT, we showed considerable differences in estimates of their sensitivity to detect SBV antibodies and to measure seroprevalence of the sheep flocks. Finally, a calculation of the number of randomly selected animals that needs to be screened from a finite flock, showed that SNT and ID.Vet are the most suitable to detect an introduction of the disease in low seroprevalence situations. The IDEXX ELISA test was only able to detect SBV antibodies in a higher seroprevalence context, which is not optimal for monitoring freedom of disease and surveillance studies.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196532</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d74e:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Srđan Pejaković, Laëtitia Wiggers, Damien Coupeau, Nathalie Kirschvink, James Mason, Benoît Muylkens&lt;/p&gt;

Pyrrole-imidazole (Py–Im) polyamides are synthetic non-genotoxic minor groove-binding small molecules. We hypothesized that Py–Im polyamides can modulate the cellular response to ionizing radiation. Pre-treatment of cells with a Py-Im polyamide prior to exposure to ionizing radiation resulted in a delay in resolution of phosphorylated γ-H2AX foci, increase in XRCC1 foci, and reduced cellular replication potential. RNA-sequencing of cell lines exposed to the polyamide showed induction of genes related to the ultraviolet radiation response. We observed that the polyamide is almost 10-fold more toxic to a cell line deficient in DNA ligase 3 as compared to the parental cell line. Alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis reveals that the polyamide induces genomic fragmentation in the ligase 3 deficient cell line but not the corresponding parental line. The polyamide interferes directly with DNA ligation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We conclude that Py-Im polyamides may be further explored as sensitizers to genotoxic therapies.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196803</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a72:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Diaz-Perez, Nathanael Kane, Alexis A.

Studies on &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; would benefit from the introduction of new selectable markers to allow more complex types of experiments to be conducted with this model animal. We established a new antibiotic selection marker for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; transformation based on nourseothricin (NTC) and its resistance-encoding gene, streptothricin-acetyl transferase 2 (&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt;). NTC was able to efficiently prevent worm development at very low concentrations, and the worms expressing &lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; were able to survive on the selection plates without any developmental defects. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and NTC selection, we were able to easily insert a 13-kb expression cassette into a defined locus in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The structure and spectrum of NTC differs from other antibiotics like hygromycin B and geneticin, making it possible to use NTC alongside them. Indeed, we confirmed NTC-&lt;i&gt;sat2&lt;/i&gt; selection could work with the hygromycin B selection system simultaneously. Thus, the new NTC–&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; system can act as a useful dominant marker for gene transfer and genome editing in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197128</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee4:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hiroyuki Obinata, Asako Sugimoto, Shinsuke Niwa&lt;/p&gt;

Reconfigurations of synchronized large-scale networks are thought to be central neural mechanisms that support cognition and behavior in the human brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings together with recent advances in network analysis now allow for sub-second snapshots of such networks. In the present study, we compared frequency-resolved functional connectivity patterns underlying reading of single words and visual recognition of symbol strings. Word reading emphasized coherence in a left-lateralized network with nodes in classical perisylvian language regions, whereas symbol processing recruited a bilateral network, including connections between frontal and parietal regions previously associated with spatial attention and visual working memory. Our results illustrate the flexible nature of functional networks, whereby processing of different form categories, written words vs. symbol strings, leads to the formation of large-scale functional networks that operate at distinct oscillatory frequencies and incorporate task-relevant regions. These results suggest that category-specific processing should be viewed not so much as a local process but as a distributed neural process implemented in signature networks. For words, increased coherence was detected particularly in the alpha (8–13 Hz) and high gamma (60–90 Hz) frequency bands, whereas increased coherence for symbol strings was observed in the high beta (21–29 Hz) and low gamma (30–45 Hz) frequency range. These findings attest to the role of coherence in specific frequency bands as a general mechanism for integrating stimulus-dependent information across brain regions.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196773</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a190:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mia Liljeström, Johanna Vartiainen, Jan Kujala, Riitta Salmelin&lt;/p&gt;

Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish (&lt;i&gt;Gambusia affinis&lt;/i&gt;) as our study organism, we characterized focal individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals’ choosiness across mate choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits. Our present study exemplifies that far more complex patterns of personality-dependent mate choice can emerge in natural systems.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b77:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bo-jian Chen, Kai Liu, Lin-jun Zhou, Guilherme Gomes-Silva, Carolin Sommer-Trembo, Martin Plath&lt;/p&gt;

An impaired UPR is associated with hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by lipid accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-fat diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated hepatic steatosis in mice. The abundance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, lipid-overloaded hepatocytes and in the livers of patients with hepatic steatosis.

Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) offer an alternate means to consume nicotine in a variety of flavored aerosols. Data are needed to better understand the impact of flavors on use behavior. A natural environment observational study was conducted on experienced ENDS users to measure the effect of e-liquid flavor on topography and consumption behavior. The RIT wPUM&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; monitor was used to record to record the date and time and puff topography (flow rate, volume, duration) for every puff taken by N = 34 participants over the course of two weeks. All participants used tobacco flavor for one week, and either berry or menthol flavor for one week. Results provide strong evidence that flavor affects the topography behaviors of mean puff flow rate and mean puff volume, and there is insufficient evidence to support an influence of flavor on mean puff duration and mean puff interval. There was insufficient evidence, due to the low power associated with the limited number of observation days, to establish a relationship between flavor and cumulative consumption behavior. While the results indicate that an effect may be evident, additional observation days are required to establish significance.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196640</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a181:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by R.

We present a new modeling and computational tool that computes rigorous summaries of network dynamics over large sets of parameter values. These summaries, organized in a database, can be searched for observed dynamics, e.g., bistability and hysteresis, to discover parameter regimes over which they are supported. We illustrate our approach on several networks underlying the restriction point of the cell cycle in humans and yeast. We rank networks by how robustly they support hysteresis, which is the observed phenotype. We find that the best 6-node human network and the yeast network share similar topology and robustness of hysteresis, in spite of having no homology between the corresponding nodes of the network. Our approach provides a new tool linking network structure and dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/StTE5SEaAR8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392bc:a077e55f</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomáš Gedeon, Bree Cummins, Shaun Harker, Konstantin Mischaikow&lt;/p&gt;

However, over the past years, different experimental techniques have been developed to investigate hematopoiesis under homeostatic conditions, thereby providing access to proliferation and differentiation rates of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the unperturbed situation. Moreover, it has become clear that hematopoiesis undergoes distinct changes during aging with large effects on HSC abundance, lineage contribution, asymmetry of division and self-renewal potential.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional therapies, several new strategies have been proposed for modulating autoimmune diseases, including the adoptive transfer of immunological cells. In this context, dendritic cells (DCs) appear to be one of the most promising treatments for autoimmune disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of adoptive transfer of DCs obtained from both naïve and ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice on the severity of TNBS induced colitis and analyze the eventual protective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;To induce oral tolerance, BALB/c mice were fed 4mg/mL OVA solution for seven consecutive days. Spleen DCs were isolated from tolerant (tDC) and naïve (nDC) mice, and then adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Three days later, colitis was induced in DC treated mice by intrarectal instillation of 100μg2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol. Control subjects received only intrarectal instillation of either TNBS solution or a vehicle. Five days later, mice from all groups were euthanized and examined for physiological and immunological parameters. Regarding the phenotype, we observed that the frequencies of CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHC II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly lower in DCs isolated from tolerant mice than in those from naive mice. However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196994</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475060:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lisiery N.

Yet the rate of decarbonisation is currently too low to achieve this. Policy-relevant scenarios therefore rely on the permanent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. However, none of the envisaged technologies has demonstrated scalability to the decarbonization targets for the year 2050. In this analysis, we show that artificial photosynthesis for CO2 reduction may deliver an efficient large-scale carbon sink. This technology is mainly developed towards solar fuels and its potential for negative emissions has been largely overlooked.

However, none of the envisaged technologies has demonstrated scalability to the decarbonization targets for the year 2050. In this analysis, we show that artificial photosynthesis for CO2 reduction may deliver an efficient large-scale carbon sink. This technology is mainly developed towards solar fuels and its potential for negative emissions has been largely overlooked. With high efficiency and low sensitivity to high temperature and illumination conditions, it could, if developed towards a mature technology, present a viable approach to fill the gap in the negative emissions budget.</description><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195975</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195975</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Boon C.

Despite the widespread acceptance of rotary blood pump (RBP) in clinical use over the past decades, the diminished flow pulsatility generated by a fixed speed RBP has been regarded as a potential factor that may lead to adverse events such as vasculature stiffening and hemorrhagic strokes. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of generating physiological pulse pressure in the pulmonary circulation by modulating the speed of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) in a mock circulation loop. A rectangular pulse profile with predetermined pulse width has been implemented as the pump speed pattern with two different phase shifts (0% and 50%) with respect to the ventricular contraction. In addition, the performance of the speed modulation strategy has been assessed under different cardiovascular states, including variation in ventricular contractility and pulmonary arterial compliance. Our results indicated that the proposed pulse profile with optimised parameters (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt; = 10000 rpm and &lt;i&gt;ω&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = 3000 rpm) was able to generate pulmonary arterial pulse pressure within the physiological range (9–15 mmHg) while avoiding undesirable pump backflow under both co- and counter-pulsation modes. As compared to co-pulsation, stroke work was reduced by over 44% under counter-pulsation, suggesting that mechanical workload of the right ventricle can be efficiently mitigated through counter-pulsing the pump speed. Furthermore, our results showed that improved ventricular contractility could potentially lead to higher risk of ventricular suction and pump backflow, while stiffening of the pulmonary artery resulted in increased pulse pressure. In conclusion, the proposed speed modulation strategy produces pulsatile hemodynamics, which is more physiologic than continuous blood flow. The findings also provide valuable insight into the interaction between RVAD speed modulation and the pulmonary circulation under various cardiovascular states.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195975</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fc:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Boon C.

The objective of this paper is to fill a gap in the literature on internationalization, in relation to the absence of objective and measurable performance indicators for the process of how firms sequentially enter external markets. To that end, this research develops a quantitative tool for use as a performance indicator of gradualness for firms entering external markets at a sectoral level. The performance indicator is based on firms’ export volumes, number of years operating in the export market, geographic areas targeted for export and when exports began to each area. The indicator is tested empirically in the wine sector. The main contribution of this study is the creation of a reliable international priority index, which can serve more widely as a valuable tool because of its potential use in other industry sectors and geographic areas, and which would allow the analysis of how geographically differentiated internationalization strategies develop.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196804</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1632c3c60b0:1621677:3dd877af</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mónica Clavel San Emeterio, Rubén Fernández-Ortiz, Jesús Arteaga-Ortiz, Pablo Dorta-González&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding what leads people to reverse their choices is important in many domains. We introduce a contrast paradigm for studying reversals in choices—here between pairs of abstract paintings—implemented in both within-subject (Experiment 1; N = 320) and between-subject (Experiment 2; N = 384) designs. On each trial, participants chose between a pair of paintings. A critical pair of average-beauty paintings was presented before and after either a reversal or control block. In the reversal block, we made efforts to bias preference away from the chosen average-beauty painting (by pairing it with more-beautiful paintings) and toward the non-chosen average-beauty painting (by pairing it with less-beautiful paintings). Meta-analysis revealed more reversals after reversal blocks than after control blocks, though only when the biasing manipulations succeeded. A second meta-analysis revealed that reversals were generally more likely for participants who later misidentified their initial choice, demonstrating that memory for initial choices influences later choices. Thus, the contrast paradigm has utility both for inducing choice reversals and identifying their causes.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196246</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7904:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zorry Belchev, Glen E.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The participation of general practitioners (GPs) in primary care research is variable and often poor. We aimed to develop a substantive and empirical theoretical framework to explain GPs’ decision-making process to participate in research.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used the grounded theory approach to construct a substantive theory to explain the decision-making process of GPs to participate in research activities. Five in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted among 21 GPs. Purposeful sampling followed by theoretical sampling were used to attempt saturation of the core category. Data were collected using semi-structured open-ended questions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and checked prior to analysis. Open line-by-line coding followed by focus coding were used to arrive at a substantive theory. Memoing was used to help bring concepts to higher abstract levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The GPs’ decision to participate in research was attributed to their inner drive and appreciation for primary care research and their confidence in managing their social and research environments. The drive and appreciation for research motivated the GPs to undergo research training to enhance their research knowledge, skills and confidence. However, the critical step in the GPs’ decision to participate in research was their ability to align their research agenda with priorities in their social environment, which included personal life goals, clinical practice and organisational culture. Perceived support for research, such as funding and technical expertise, facilitated the GPs’ participation in research. In addition, prior experiences participating in research also influenced the GPs’ confidence in taking part in future research.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The key to GPs deciding to participate in research is whether the research agenda aligns with the priorities in their social environment. Therefore, research training is important, but should be included in further measures and should comply with GPs’ social environments and research support.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196379</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67c0:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seng Fah Tong, Chirk Jenn Ng, Verna Kar Mun Lee, Ping Yein Lee, Irmi Zarina Ismail, Ee Ming Khoo, Noor Azizah Tahir, Iliza Idris, Mastura Ismail, Adina Abdullah&lt;/p&gt;

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>2</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e3a:abeb7260</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan E.

The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05032-0</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05032-0/d41586-018-05032-0_15728100.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1525158000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Tissue-thin lasers flex to hug curves</title><crawled>1525205006186</crawled><fingerprint>874cc6ec</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05032-0</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tissue-thin lasers flex to hug curves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tissue-thin lasers flex to hug curves, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05032-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05032-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bendy membrane lasers could serve as security barcodes.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05032-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1631d4d776a:274a967:11c251fd</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tissue-thin lasers flex to hug curves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tissue-thin lasers flex to hug curves, Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05032-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05032-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bendy membrane lasers could serve as security barcodes.</content></content><engagement>4</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/306167v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/23/306167</canonicalUrl><author><name>Bokulich, N.</name></author><published>1524466800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>q2-sample-classifier: machine-learning tools for microbiome classification and regression [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1524509274540</crawled><fingerprint>ef6c946d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/306167v1?rss=1</originId><description>Microbiome studies often aim to predict outcomes or differentiate samples based on their microbial compositions, tasks that can be efficiently performed by supervised learning methods.

In the United States (US), the sugarcane aphid (SCA) &lt;i&gt;Melanaphis sacchari&lt;/i&gt; (Zehnter) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was introduced in the 1970s, however at that time it was only considered a pest of sugarcane. In 2013, a massive outbreak of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sacchari&lt;/i&gt; occured on sorghum, resulting in significant economic damage to sorghum grown in North America including the US, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The aim of the present study was to determine if the SCA pest emergence in American sorghum resulted from the introduction of new genotypes. To this end we used microsatellite markers and COI sequencing to compare the genetic diversity of SCA populations collected in the Americas after the 2013 SCA outbreak on sorghum (during 2013–2017) to older samples collected before the pest outbreak (during 2007–2009). Our results show that the SCA outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean observed since 2013 belong to populations exhibiting low genetic diversity and consisting of a dominant clonal lineage, MLL-F, which colonizes &lt;i&gt;Sorghum&lt;/i&gt; spp. and sugarcane. The comparison of MLL-F specimens collected post-2013 with specimens collected in Louisiana in 2007 revealed that both populations are genetically distinct, according to COI sequencing and microsatellite data analyses. Our result suggest that MLL-F is a new invasive genotype introduced into the Americas that has spread rapidly across sorghum growing regions in the US, Mexico, Honduras and the Caribbean. The origin of this introduction is either Africa or Asia, with Asia being the most probable source.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196124</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b0:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Nibouche, Laurent Costet, Jocelyn R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Preclinical breast cancer models recapitulating the clinical course of metastatic disease are crucial for drug development. Highly metastatic cell lines forming spontaneous metastasis following orthotopic implantation were previously developed and characterized regarding their biological and histological characteristics. This study aimed to non-invasively and longitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formation and progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14–16 days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity of primary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT and fluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agent administration.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10 days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice, predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake. Lung metastases were detected as the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake increased significantly between pre- and post-metastasis scan. Using a liposomal dual-modality agent, CT and fluorescence confirmed BLI detected lesions and identified additional metastatic nodules in the intraperitoneal cavity and lung.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of complementary anatomical and functional imaging techniques can provide high sensitivity characterization of metastatic disease spread, progression and overall disease burden. The described models and imaging toolset can be implemented as an effective means for quantitative treatment response evaluation in metastatic breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196892</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aea:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Inga B.

This study aimed to non-invasively and longitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formation and progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14–16 days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity of primary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT and fluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agent administration.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10 days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice, predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake. Lung metastases were detected as the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET uptake increased significantly between pre- and post-metastasis scan. Using a liposomal dual-modality agent, CT and fluorescence confirmed BLI detected lesions and identified additional metastatic nodules in the intraperitoneal cavity and lung.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of complementary anatomical and functional imaging techniques can provide high sensitivity characterization of metastatic disease spread, progression and overall disease burden. The described models and imaging toolset can be implemented as an effective means for quantitative treatment response evaluation in metastatic breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00169</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jctcce/~3/SlM8BFaLPGQ/acs.jctc.8b00169</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Alain C.

Numerous problems encountered in computational biology can be formulated as optimization problems. In this context, optimization of drug release characteristics or dosing schedules for anticancer agents has become a prominent area not only for the development of new drugs, but also for established drugs. However, in complex systems, optimization of drug exposure is not a trivial task and cannot be efficiently addressed through trial-error simulation exercises. Finding a solution to those problems is a challenging task which requires more advanced strategies like optimal control theory. In this work, we perform an optimal control analysis on a previously developed computational model for the testosterone effects of triptorelin in prostate cancer patients with the goal of finding optimal drug-release characteristics. We demonstrate how numerical control optimization of non-linear models can be used to find better therapeutic approaches in order to improve the final outcome of the patients.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8wx1FdaORT0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162df187f34:50ab4:a077e55f</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Itziar Irurzun-Arana, Alvaro Janda, Sergio Ardanza-Trevijano, Iñaki F.

The objectives of this study are to analyze the associations between educational levels and poor self-rated health (SRH) among adults in Brazil and to assess trends in the prevalence of poor self-rated health across educational groups between 1998 and 2013. Individual-level data came from the 1998, 2003 and 2008 Brazilian National Household Survey and the 2013 National Health Survey. We estimate prevalence rates of poor SRH by education. Using multivariable regressions, we assess the associations between educational levels and poor self-rated health. We use these regressions to predict the estimated ratios between the prevalence rates of those in low vs. high education in order to assess if relative changes in poor SRH have narrowed over time. Finally, we tested for statistically significant time trends in adult chronic disease inequalities by education. Results indicate a clear educational gradient in poor SRH. Prevalence ratios show that Brazilian adults with no education have levels of poor SRH that are 7 to 9 times higher than those with some college or more. The difference between those with lowest and highest education increased from 1998 to 2013. Compared to those with no education, there were increases in the prevalence of poor SRH among those with primary and secondary incomplete as well as among those with secondary complete in 2008 and 2013. In conclusion, there is a positive association between poor SRH and low education. Brazil has many social and geographic inequalities in health. Even though educational levels are increasing, there is no improvement in the general subjective health of Brazilians. Health inequalities by race and region highlight the need to improve the health of socially disadvantaged groups in Brazil. Addressing chronic conditions and mental health is needed to improve self-perceptions of health in Brazil as well.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196494</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e49:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Flavia Cristina Drumond Andrade, Jeenal Deepak Mehta&lt;/p&gt;

Extracting and identifying genetic material from environmental media (i.e. water and soil) presents a unique opportunity for researchers to assess biotic diversity and ecosystem health with increased speed and decreased cost as compared to traditional methods (e.g. trapping). The heterogeneity of soil mineralogy, spatial and temporal variations however present unique challenges to sampling and interpreting results. Specifically, fate/transport of genetic material in the terrestrial environment represents a substantial data gap. Here we investigate to what degree, benthic fauna transport genetic material through soil. Using the red worm (Eisenia fetida), we investigate how natural movement through artificial soil affect the transport of genetic material. All experiments were run in Frabill® Habitat® II worm systems with approximately 5 cm depth of artificial soil. We selected an “exotic” source of DNA not expected to be present in soil, zebrafish (Danio rerio) tissue. Experiment groups contained homogenized zebrafish tissue placed in a defined location combined with a varying number of worms (10, 30 or 50 worms per experimental group). Experimental groups comprised two controls and three treatment groups (representing different worm biomass) in triplicate. A total of 210 soil samples were randomly collected over the course of 15 days to investigate the degree of genetic transfer, and the rate of detection. Positive detections were identified in 14% - 38% of samples across treatment groups, with an overall detection rate of 25%. These findings highlight two important issues when utilizing environmental DNA for biologic assessments. First, benthic fauna are capable of redistributing genetic material through a soil matrix. Second, despite a defined sample container and abundance of worm biomass, as many as 86% of the samples were negative. This has substantial implications for researchers and managers who wish to interpret environmental DNA results from terrestrial systems. Studies such as these will aid in future study protocol design and sample collection methodology.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196430</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb6:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher M.

Non-contact heart rate (HR) measurement from facial videos has attracted high interests due to its convenience and cost effectiveness. However, accurate and robust HR estimation under various realistic scenarios remain a very challenging problem. In this paper, we develop a novel system which can achieve a robust and accurate HR estimation under those challenging scenarios. First, to minimize tracking-artifacts arising from large head motions and facial expressions, we propose a joint face detection and alignment method which can produce alignment-friendly facial bounding boxes with reliable initial facial shapes, facilitating accurate and robust face alignment even in the presence of large pose variations and expressions. Second, different from most existing methods [1–5] which derive pulse signals from predetermined grid cells (i.e. local patches), our patches are varying-sized triangles generated adaptively to exclude negative effects from non-rigid facial motions. Third, we propose an adaptive patch selection method to choose patches which contain skin regions and are more likely to contain useful information, followed by an independent component analysis, for an accurate HR estimate. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our own dataset demonstrated that, comparing with the state-of-the-art methods [1–3], our method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by a large margin, ranging from 12% to 63%, and can provide a robust and accurate estimation under various challenging scenarios.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197275</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7e:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhiwei Wang, Xin Yang, Kwang-Ting Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Since endophytes can affect metabolism of host plants, they are expected to be used to improve crop quality, especially for crops with organoleptic sensitive products such as wine grape. However, details of metabolic interactions between endophytes and host plants were less understood. In this work, we used high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the metabolites of fruit flesh cells of grape treated with dual culture of different endophytic fungal strains (EFS). We observed that the dual-culture with different fungal strains show different metabolites composition in grape cells. In response to different EFS, quantities of detected metabolites in grape cells varied from 6 to 17 in this assay, and 1 to 11 novel metabolites were introduced into metabolome of grape cells. Dual-culture with fungal strains CS2, RH16 and RH5 introduced the highest quantities (10 or 11) of novel metabolites in grape cells. More importantly, the modification of metabolic profiles in grape cells &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; fungal endophytes appeared to be fungal strain/genus-specificity. Overall, this work revealed that introduction of specific metabolites in host plants may be one consequence during the process of endophytes-host metabolic interactions, which raise the possibility to shape grape qualities and characteristics using tool of fungal endophytes.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196996</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42264:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li-Hua Huang, Ming-Quan Yuan, Xiu-Jin Ao, An-Yun Ren, Han-Bo Zhang, Ming-Zhi Yang&lt;/p&gt;

We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is ~100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic interactions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>26</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4099.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4099</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/16.cover-source.jpg?itok=dseVEs2E</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><author><name>Wen–Pin Hsieh, Frederic Deschamps, Takuo Okuchi, Jung–Fu Lin</name></author><published>1523990209000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Effects of iron on the lattice thermal conductivity of Earth’s deep mantle and implications for mantle dynamics [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences]</title><crawled>1523994445149</crawled><fingerprint>bebfaee2</fingerprint><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4099.short?rss=1</originId><description>Iron may critically influence the physical properties and thermochemical structures of Earth’s lower mantle.

Currently approved monoamine modulating antidepressant and anxiolytic pharmaceutics fail in over one third of patients due to delayed and variable therapeutic effect, adverse reactions preceding the therapeutic action, and adherence issues. Even with adequate adherence to the regimen and tolerability, one third of the patients do not respond to any class of antidepressants. There is a strong correlation between treatment resistant depression and increase in inflammatory cytokines in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with pain and inflammation. While a link between pain, inflammation and depression has been suggested it remains unclear which anti-inflammatory treatment may be beneficial to patients with depression and anxiety due to pain. Here, we analyzed 430,783 FDA adverse effect reports of patients treated for pain to identify potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of various anti-inflammatory medications. Patients treated for depression or patients taking any known antidepressants were excluded. The odds ratio analysis of 139,072 NSAID reports revealed that ketoprofen was associated with decreased reports of depression by a factor of 2.32 (OR 0.43 and 95% Confidence Interval [0.31, 0.59]) and decreased reports of anxiety by a factor of 2.86 (OR 0.35 [0.22, 0.56]), diclofenac with decreased depression reports by a factor of 2.22 (OR 0.45 [0.40, 0.49]) and anxiety by a factor of 2.13 (OR 0.47 [0.41, 0.54]), while naproxen decreased depression reports by a factor of 1.92 (OR 0.52 [0.49, 0.57]) and anxiety by a factor of 1.23 (OR 0.81 [0.75, 0.88]).

Background &lt;p&gt;Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are biomarkers for several neoplastic diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a literature search, followed by experimental screening and validation in order to establish a miRNA panel in combination with the assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and to evaluate its performance in HCC diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Expression of miRNAs was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 406 serum samples from 118 Vietnamese patients with hepatitis B (HBV)-related HCC, 69 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 100 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 119 healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three miRNAs (mir-21, mir-122, mir-192) were expressed differentially among the studied subgroups and positively correlated with AFP levels. The individual miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir192 or the triplex miRNA panel showed high diagnostic accuracy for HCC (HCC vs. CHB, AUC = 0.906; HCC vs. CHB+LC, AUC = 0.81; HCC vs. CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.854). When AFP levels were ≤20ng/ml, the triplex miRNA panel still was accurate in distinguishing HCC from the other conditions (CHB, AUC = 0.922; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.836; CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.862). When AFP levels were used in combination with the triplex miRNA panel, the diagnostic performance was significantly improved in discriminating HCC from the other groups (LC, AUC = 0.887; CHB, AUC = 0.948; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.887).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The three miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir-192, together with AFP, are biomarkers that may be applied to improve diagnostics of HCC in HBV patients, especially in HBV-related LC patients with normal AFP levels or HCC patients with small tumor sizes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196081</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f78f6:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ngo Tat Trung, Dang Chieu Duong, Hoang Van Tong, Tran Thi Thu Hien, Phan Quoc Hoan, Mai Hong Bang, Mai Thanh Binh, Thai Doan Ky, Nguyen Lam Tung, Nguyen Tien Thinh, Vu Viet Sang, Le Thi Phuong Thao, C-Thomas Bock, Thirumalaisamy P.

We performed a literature search, followed by experimental screening and validation in order to establish a miRNA panel in combination with the assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and to evaluate its performance in HCC diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Expression of miRNAs was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 406 serum samples from 118 Vietnamese patients with hepatitis B (HBV)-related HCC, 69 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 100 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 119 healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three miRNAs (mir-21, mir-122, mir-192) were expressed differentially among the studied subgroups and positively correlated with AFP levels. The individual miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir192 or the triplex miRNA panel showed high diagnostic accuracy for HCC (HCC vs. CHB, AUC = 0.906; HCC vs. CHB+LC, AUC = 0.81; HCC vs. CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.854). When AFP levels were ≤20ng/ml, the triplex miRNA panel still was accurate in distinguishing HCC from the other conditions (CHB, AUC = 0.922; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.836; CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.862). When AFP levels were used in combination with the triplex miRNA panel, the diagnostic performance was significantly improved in discriminating HCC from the other groups (LC, AUC = 0.887; CHB, AUC = 0.948; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.887).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The three miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir-192, together with AFP, are biomarkers that may be applied to improve diagnostics of HCC in HBV patients, especially in HBV-related LC patients with normal AFP levels or HCC patients with small tumor sizes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Hydration_Structure_of_Methylthiolate_from_QM_MM_Molecular_Dynamics/6199340</link><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1525046400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Thiols are widely present in biological systems, most notably as the side chain of cysteine amino acids in proteins.

Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) that can modulate RNA splicing are used for the treatment of many genetic disorders. To enhance the efficacy of modulating splicing, it is important to optimize SSOs with regard to target sites, GC content, melting temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value), chemistries, and lengths. Thus, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay systems that allow for the rapid and simple screening of SSOs are essential for optimizing SSO design. In this study, we established a novel tri-chromatic reporter cell line for SSO screening. This reporter cell line is designed to express three different fluorescent proteins (blue, green, and red) and was employed for high content screening (HCS, also known as high content analysis; HCA) for the evaluation of SSO-induced exon skipping by analyzing the expression levels of fluorescent proteins. The blue fluorescent protein is stably expressed throughout the cell and is useful for data normalization using cell numbers. Furthermore, both the green and red fluorescent proteins were used for monitoring the splicing patterns of target genes. Indeed, we demonstrated that this novel reporter cell line involving HCS leads to a more rapid and simple approach for the evaluation of exon skipping than widely used methods, such as RT-PCR, western blotting, and quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, a brief screening of Locked nucleic acids (LNA)-based SSOs targeting exon 51 in &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt; was performed using the reporter cell line. The LNA-based SSO cocktail shows high exon 51 skipping in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the LNA-based SSO cocktails display high exon 51 skipping activities on endogenous &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197373</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b3:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takenori Shimo, Keisuke Tachibana, Satoshi Obika&lt;/p&gt;

Flightless saproxylic beetles were selected in order to study the impact of temporal and spatial discontinuity of forests. They were chosen because: (1) they are unable to fly, making them dispersal-limited species, (2) they have a saproxylic diet, which means they are closely linked to the forest, and (3), they have rarely been studied. Forest temporal continuity was expected to be the main factor explaining the presence of these species, modulated by the past and present amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. Twenty-seven forests, distributed into three zones, were sampled in southwestern France. Flightless saproxylic beetles were surveyed using a Winkler extractor and a Berlese funnel. Their presence/absence were modelled using generalised linear mixed models, with zone variable as random effect. Two species showed significant &lt;i&gt;zone&lt;/i&gt; effect and were only or more present in the zone with the highest present forest amount in a 0.5 km radius. In the model that converged, the only selected variable was the past amount of forest in the landscape. The size of the forest, the presence of dead wood and the forest temporal continuity were not included in this model. The importance of the amount of forest in the landscape supports the hypothesis that dispersal-limited species are affected by landscape characteristics. This study demonstrates an important link between the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dienerella clathrata&lt;/i&gt; and the amount of forest in the past, which led to an indicator species analysis being performed.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197847</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f426916:4a23bbb:3dd877af</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eugénie Cateau, Pierre-Alexis Herrault, David Sheeren, Sylvie Ladet, Hervé Brustel&lt;/p&gt;

This study demonstrates an important link between the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dienerella clathrata&lt;/i&gt; and the amount of forest in the past, which led to an indicator species analysis being performed.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025150?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025150?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Chao Zhang</name></author><published>1524139352000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><fingerprint>a9372ac9</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025150?af=R</originId><title>Note: On the dielectric constant of nanoconfined water</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d19:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195933</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195933</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Samar S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Frequent changes in the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) occurring worldwide demand regular surveillance to study their composition and distribution in healthcare facilities. We investigated the genotypic characteristics of MRSA obtained in Kuwait hospitals to better understand their clonal distribution.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,327 MRSA isolates obtained from clinical samples in 13 Kuwait hospitals from 1 January to 31 December 2016 were investigated using antibiogram, SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; typing, spa typing and DNA microarray.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The isolates belonged to six SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; types with the majority belonging to type IV (658; 49.5%) and type V (355; 26.7%). Two hundred and sixty-one spa types were identified with spa types t688, t304, t860, t127, t044, t311, t002, t223, t267, t019, t3841, t005, t084, t852, and t657 constituting 51.0% (n = 677) of the isolates. Among the 1,327 MRSA isolates, 102 (7.68%) isolates were identified as novel variants of internationally recognized MRSA clones. These 102 isolates were investigated further and belonged to 14 clonal complexes (CCs) with CC361 (32; 32.3%), CC30 (15; 14.7%), CC22 (13; 12.7%) and CC1 (11, 10.7%) as the dominant CCs. Eighty-one (79.4%) of the novel isolates harbored SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; IV or V+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt; composite genetic elements. Four isolates (3.9%) harbored unusual combinations of &lt;i&gt;ccr&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; complexes comprising of CC6-MRSA [IV+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrC&lt;/i&gt;], CC97-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB2&lt;/i&gt;], CC121-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrB4&lt;/i&gt;] and CC1-MRSA-pseudoSCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; [class B mec+&lt;i&gt;fusc&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB1&lt;/i&gt;]. Forty-six (45.1%) of these isolates were positive for PVL and 89 (87.2%) were resistant to fusidic acid mediated by &lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The study showed the emergence of novel variants of previously recognized MRSA genotypes with unusual genetic characteristics including high prevalence of PVL and fusidic acid resistance in Kuwait hospitals.

One of these problems is their bias towards the learning datasets which, being dominated by destabilizing mutations, causes predictions to be better for destabilizing than for stabilizing mutations. We thoroughly analyzed the biases in the prediction of folding free energy changes upon point mutations ({Delta}{Delta}G0) and proposed some unbiased solutions. We started by constructing a dataset Ssym of experimentally measured {Delta}{Delta}G0s with an equal number of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, by collecting mutations for which the structure of both the wild type and mutant protein is available. On this balanced dataset, we assessed the performances of fifteen widely used {Delta}{Delta}G0 predictors. After the astonishing observation that almost all these methods are strongly biased towards destabilizing mutations, especially those that use black-box machine learning, we proposed an elegant way to solve the bias issue by imposing physical symmetries under inverse mutations on the model structure, which we implemented in PoPMuSiCsym. This new predictor constitutes an efficient trade-off between accuracy and absence of biases. Some final considerations and suggestions for further improvement of the predictors are discussed.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308239v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162fe37ea83:660e4f:91749e5b</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Bioinformatics tools that predict protein stability changes upon point mutations have made a lot of progress in the last decades and have become accurate and fast enough to make computational mutagenesis experiments feasible, even on a proteome scale.

After the astonishing observation that almost all these methods are strongly biased towards destabilizing mutations, especially those that use black-box machine learning, we proposed an elegant way to solve the bias issue by imposing physical symmetries under inverse mutations on the model structure, which we implemented in PoPMuSiCsym. This new predictor constitutes an efficient trade-off between accuracy and absence of biases. Some final considerations and suggestions for further improvement of the predictors are discussed.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/527/eaai7838?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/527/eaai7838.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Babaei, R., Schuster, M., Meln, I., Lerch, S., Ghandour, R.

As demonstrated in more than 30 examples, our waterassistedLA/photoredox catalytic activation strategy allows for excess-free, equimolar radical cross-coupling and subsequent formal Markovnikov hydroxylation to versatile 1,4-difunctionalized products in good to excellent yields.</description><engagement>3</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/B3aTIEP8ihY/s41598-018-25860-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Gökhan Karaova</name></author><published>1525762800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach</title><crawled>1525767537712</crawled><fingerprint>c84a565a</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25860-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/B3aTIEP8ihY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633ed50430:ceec1:3dd877af</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25860-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Full-Wave Electromagnetic Optimisation of Corrugated Metallic Reflectors Using a Multigrid Approach&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/B3aTIEP8ihY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25860-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04057-3</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/gqv1Fb_LrCY/s41467-018-04057-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ceri Shipton</name></author><published>1525849200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>78,000-year-old record of Middle and Later stone age innovation in an East African tropical forest</title><crawled>1525858023424</crawled><fingerprint>d3c7a136</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04057-3</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;78,000-year-old record of Middle and Later stone age innovation in an East African tropical forest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;78,000-year-old record of Middle and Later stone age innovation in an East African tropical forest, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04057-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04057-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Most of the archaeological record of the Middle to Later Stone Age transition comes from southern Africa.

The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania infantum&lt;/i&gt; infection. In contrast, an antibody response against &lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-&lt;i&gt;Lu&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies. Dogs were classified into five groups based on serological and parasitological diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The following linear regression model was fitted: IgG level = mean + origin + sex + age + use of a repellent collar, and the residuals were assumed as pseudo-phenotypes for the association test between phenotypes and genotypes (GWA). A component of variance model that takes into account polygenic and sample structure effects (EMMAX) was employed for GWA. Phenotypic findings indicated that anti-SGH IgG levels remained higher in exposed and subclinically infected dogs than in severely diseased dogs even in regression model residuals. Five associated markers were identified on chromosomes 2, 20 and 31. The mapped genes included &lt;i&gt;CD180&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RP105&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MITF&lt;/i&gt; related to the rapid activation of B lymphocytes and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The findings pointed to chromosomal segments useful for functional confirmation studies and a search for adjuvant molecules of the anti-saliva response.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197215</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee9:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luís F.

LncRNAs are regulatory noncoding RNAs that play crucial roles in many biological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNA is thought to be involved in many complex diseases; lncRNAs are often the targets of miRNAs in the indirect regulation of gene expression. Numerous studies have indicated that miRNA-lncRNA interactions are closely related to the occurrence and development of cancers. Thus, it is important to develop an effective method for the identification of cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA interactions. In this study, we compiled 155653 experimentally validated and predicted miRNA-lncRNA associations, which we defined as basic interactions. We next constructed an individual-specific miRNA-lncRNA network (ISMLN) for each cancer sample and a basic miRNA-lncRNA network (BMLN) for each type of cancer by examining the expression profiles of miRNAs and lncRNAs in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. We then selected potential miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers based on the BLMN. Using this method, we identified cancer-related miRNA-lncRNA biomarkers and modules specific to a certain cancer. This method of profiling will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of cancers at the level of gene regulatory networks.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196681</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a67:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guangle Zhang, Cong Pian, Zhi Chen, Jin Zhang, Mingmin Xu, Liangyun Zhang, Yuanyuan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

This method of profiling will contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of cancers at the level of gene regulatory networks.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0012-z</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/jXwLsKgj_tQ/s41591-018-0012-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jianfeng Shen</name></author><published>1525676400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>ARID1A deficiency promotes mutability and potentiates therapeutic antitumor immunity unleashed by immune checkpoint blockade</title><crawled>1525706901788</crawled><fingerprint>a3c6755c</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0012-z</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARID1A deficiency promotes mutability and potentiates therapeutic antitumor immunity unleashed by immune checkpoint blockade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARID1A deficiency promotes mutability and potentiates therapeutic antitumor immunity unleashed by immune checkpoint blockade, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0012-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0012-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Loss of mismatch-repair protein ARID1A in cancer correlates with high mutation load &amp;amp; checkpoint blockade response, complementing MSI-based prognosis.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/jXwLsKgj_tQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0012-z/MediaObjects/41591_2018_12_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>445</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_1633b37c91c:2a6061e:5785ab88</id><engagement>2</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARID1A deficiency promotes mutability and potentiates therapeutic antitumor immunity unleashed by immune checkpoint blockade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARID1A deficiency promotes mutability and potentiates therapeutic antitumor immunity unleashed by immune checkpoint blockade, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0012-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0012-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Loss of mismatch-repair protein ARID1A in cancer correlates with high mutation load &amp;amp; checkpoint blockade response, complementing MSI-based prognosis.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/jXwLsKgj_tQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0012-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01658</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/fwsJGSnh7Sw/acs.jpcb.8b01658</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Feng Pan, Viet Hoang Man, Christopher Roland, Celeste Sagui</name></author><published>1523937600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01658/20180417/images/medium/jp-2018-01658e_0023.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01658&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Though gene expression data has been widely used to infer the cellular regulatory networks, the methods mainly infer correlations rather than causality. We propose that a causal inference framework successfully used for eQTL data can be extended to infer causal regulatory networks using enhancers as causal anchors and enhancer RNA expression as a readout of enhancer activity. Results: We developed statistical models and likelihood-ratio tests to infer causal gene regulatory networks using enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression information as a causal anchor and applied the framework to eRNA and transcript expression data from the FANTOM consortium. Predicted causal targets of transcription factors (TFs) in mouse embryonic stem cells, macrophages and erythroblastic leukemia overlapped significantly with experimentally validated targets from ChIP-seq and perturbation data. We further improved the model by taking into account that some TFs might act in a quantitative, dosage-dependent manner, whereas others might act predominantly in a binary on/off fashion. We predicted TF targets from concerted variation of eRNA and TF and target promoter expression levels within a single cell type as well as across multiple cell types. Importantly, TFs with high-confidence predictions were largely different between these two analyses, demonstrating that variability within a cell type is highly relevant for target prediction of cell type specific factors. Finally, we generated a compendium of high-confidence TF targets across diverse human cell and tissue types.

Access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains deficient without an adequate workforce. There is limited understanding of the gender gap in surgical trainees in LMICs. In Rwanda, females fill only one of 20 positions available. Understanding surgeons’ experiences and perceptions of surgical careers may help facilitate support for females to contribute to the global surgical workforce. We performed qualitative analysis on perceptions of surgical careers through semi-structured interviews of all female surgeons (n = 6) and corresponding male surgeons (n = 6) who are training or have trained at University of Rwanda. Transcripts were analyzed with code structure formed through an integrated approach. Question categories formed the deductive framework, while theoretical saturation was reached through inductive grounded theory. Themes were organized within two key points of the career timeline. First, for developing interest in surgery, three main themes were identified: role models, patient case encounters, and exposure to surgery. Second, for selecting and sustaining surgical careers, four main themes emerged: social expectations about roles within the family, physical and mental challenges, professional and personal support, and finances. All female surgeons emphasized gender assumptions and surgical working culture as obstacles, with a corresponding strong sense of self-confidence and internal motivation that drew them to select and maintain careers in surgery. Family, time, and physical endurance were cited as persistent challenges for female participants. Our study reveals concepts for further exploration about gendered perceptions of surgical careers. Efforts to improve support for female surgical careers as a strategy for shaping surgical work culture and professional development in Rwanda should be considered. Such strategies may be beneficial for improving the global surgical workforce.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197290</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915d:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sojung Yi, Yihan Lin, Grace Kansayisa, Ainhoa Costas-Chavarri&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH. Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197297</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7f:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuyuki Sato, Masaru Hatano, Yukiko Iwasaki, Hisataka Maki, Akihito Saito, Shun Minatsuki, Toshiro Inaba, Eisuke Amiya, Keishi Fujio, Masafumi Watanabe, Kazuhiko Yamamoto, Issei Komuro&lt;/p&gt;

Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4887.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4887</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/19.cover-source.jpg?itok=gY78Iz1p</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><author><name>Thijs Bol, Mathijs de Vaan, Arnout van de Rijt</name></author><published>1525803378000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>The Matthew effect in science funding [Social Sciences]</title><crawled>1525807602634</crawled><fingerprint>f12934bc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4887.short?rss=1</originId><description>A classic thesis is that scientific achievement exhibits a “Matthew effect”: Scientists who have previously been successful are more likely to succeed again, producing increasing distinction.

These studies validate BPL as a potential drug target that could serve as an alternate frontline target in the development of new drugs against &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197531</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197531</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197531</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ying-Ying Zhang</name></author><published>1525986000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Correction: +mRNA expression of LRRC55 protein (leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 55) in the adult mouse brain</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><crawled>1525975210375</crawled><fingerprint>e72fb2b2</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197531</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ying-Ying Zhang, Xue Han, Ye Liu, Jian Chen, Lei Hua, Qian Ma, Yang-Yu-Xin Huang, Qiong-Yao Tang, Zhe Zhang&lt;/p&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b35d987:153251f:3dd877af</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ying-Ying Zhang, Xue Han, Ye Liu, Jian Chen, Lei Hua, Qian Ma, Yang-Yu-Xin Huang, Qiong-Yao Tang, Zhe Zhang&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05105-0</link><recrawled>1525453909859</recrawled><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05105-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Inga Vesper</name></author><published>1525330800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>€100-billion budget proposed for Europe’s next big research programme</title><crawled>1525387098819</crawled><fingerprint>2c46bd30</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05105-0</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;€100-billion budget proposed for Europe’s next big research programme&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;€100-billion budget proposed for Europe’s next big research programme, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05105-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05105-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Initial funding plans for the seven-year Horizon Europe science initiative get a lukewarm reception.</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1632827fac3:105c78c:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;€100-billion budget proposed for Europe’s next big research programme&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;€100-billion budget proposed for Europe’s next big research programme, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05105-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05105-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Initial funding plans for the seven-year Horizon Europe science initiative get a lukewarm reception.</content></content><engagement>67</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196455</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196455</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>John D.

During hemolysis, hemoglobin and heme released from red blood cells promote oxidative stress, inflammation and thrombosis. Plasma haptoglobin and hemopexin scavenge free hemoglobin and heme, respectively, but can be depleted in hemolytic states. Haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation protect tissues, including the vasculature, liver and kidneys. It is widely assumed that these protective effects are due primarily to hemoglobin and heme clearance from the vasculature. However, this simple assumption does not account for the consequent cytoprotective adaptation seen in cells and organs. To further address the mechanism, we used a hyperhemolytic murine model (Townes-SS) of sickle cell disease to examine cellular responses to haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation. A single infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin (± equimolar hemoglobin) in SS-mice increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the liver, kidney and skin several fold within 1 hour and decreased nuclear NF-ĸB phospho-p65, and vaso-occlusion for 48 hours after infusion. Plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were not significantly changed 1 hour after infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin. Haptoglobin and hemopexin also inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation and lipopolysaccharide-induced vaso-occlusion in SS-mice. Inhibition of HO-1 activity with tin protoporphyrin blocked the protections afforded by haptoglobin and hemopexin in SS-mice. The HO-1 reaction product carbon monoxide, fully restored the protection, in part by inhibiting Weibel-Palade body mobilization of P-selectin and von Willebrand factor to endothelial cell surfaces. Thus, the mechanism by which haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation in hyperhemolytic SS-mice induces cytoprotective cellular responses is linked to increased HO-1 activity.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196455</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67c4:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by John D.

DepR, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator encoded by the last gene of the putative &lt;i&gt;min&lt;/i&gt; operon (&lt;i&gt;orf21-20-19-depR&lt;/i&gt;) located at the downstream region of the anticancer agent FK228 biosynthetic gene cluster in &lt;i&gt;Chromobacterium violaceum&lt;/i&gt; No. 968, positively regulates the biosynthesis of FK228. In this work, the mechanism underlining this positive regulation was probed by multiple approaches. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting assay (DIFA) identified a conserved 35-nt DNA segment in the &lt;i&gt;orf21-orf22&lt;/i&gt; intergenic region where the purified recombinant DepR binds to. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) promoter probe assays established that transcription of phasin gene &lt;i&gt;orf22&lt;/i&gt; increases in the &lt;i&gt;depR&lt;/i&gt; deletion mutant of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;violaceum&lt;/i&gt; (CvΔdepR) compared to the wild-type strain.

The present study aimed to identify novel microbial producers of bioemulsificant compounds from Antarctic soils. Fifty-nine microbial strains were isolated from five different locations at South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, and screened for biosurfactant production by β-hemolytic activity. Strain So 3.2 was determined as bioemulsifier-producer and identified by phenotypic and molecular characterization as &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt;. Emulsification activity, oil displacement method and drop-collapsing test were performed to evaluate the biosurfactant activity with different oils and hydrocarbons using two different culture media (Luria Bertani and Bushnell Haas in the presence of different carbon sources: glucose, glycerol, olive oil and n-Hexadecane). Cell free supernatant of Bushnell Haas culture supplemented with n-Hexadecane showed the best results for all tests. Emulsification of hydrocarbons exceeded 60%, reaching up to 90% on oil with high API grade, while displacement tests ranged from 8 cm to 4 cm in diameter according the culture media and tested oils. Our results revealed that &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt; So3.2 is able to produce bioemulsifiers capable of emulsifying hydrocarbons and oils, which could be used in different biotechnological applications, particularly for bioremediation of environments contaminated by oil leaks.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196054</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb93:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Claudio Lamilla, Douglas Braga, Rui Castro, Carolina Guimarães, Livia V.

Our results revealed that &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt; So3.2 is able to produce bioemulsifiers capable of emulsifying hydrocarbons and oils, which could be used in different biotechnological applications, particularly for bioremediation of environments contaminated by oil leaks.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Efthymia Giosa</name></author><published>1525986000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>The importance of artificial wetlands for birds: A case study from Cyprus</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><fingerprint>d7dac92a</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Efthymia Giosa, Christos Mammides, Savvas Zotos&lt;/p&gt;
The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities. Overall, regardless of the type, larger wetlands, with shallower waters tend to be more biodiverse. The same is true for wetlands surrounded by a higher percentage of hunting reserves and a lower density of road networks, albeit the effect of road networks was weaker. We conclude, from our results, that although the conservation value of natural wetlands is higher, artificial wetlands have the potential to play a complimentary role in the conservation of bird communities, assuming those wetlands have the right characteristics (e.g., in terms of size and depth) and assuming that the disturbances resulting from high-impact human-activities (e.g., hunting) are minimized.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e9:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Efthymia Giosa, Christos Mammides, Savvas Zotos&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Social support has been identified as a significant factor in facilitating better health outcomes following injury. However, research has primarily focused on the role of social support from the perspective of the person experiencing an injury. Limited research has examined the experiences of the family members and friends of a person with injury. This study aims to explore the perceptions and experiences of social support and recovery following a transport-related musculoskeletal injury (MSI) in a population of injured persons and their family members and friends.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted using a phenomenological qualitative research design. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten persons with MSI, recruited via the Transport Accident Commission (TAC) in Victoria, Australia. Seven family members and friends were also interviewed. The data was analysed using constant comparative method and thematic analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Several themes were identified including: (1) key sources and types of support received, (2) relationship development and (3) challenges of providing and receiving support. Participants with MSI reported stories about how the social network provided emotional and tangible support. Family members and friends confirmed the supportive acts provided to the participants with MSI. Positive iterative changes in relationships were reported by the participants with MSI. Participants with MSI, their family members and friends described several difficulties including loss of independence, feeling like a burden, and the impact of caring on health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The role of social support is complex given the multitude of people involved in the recovery process. The findings of this study suggest that persons with MSI may benefit from support groups and maintenance of existing support networks. Furthermore, family members and friends engaged in the recovery process may benefit from support in this role.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196337</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67be:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Khic-Houy Prang, Sharon Newnam, Janneke Berecki-Gisolf&lt;/p&gt;
